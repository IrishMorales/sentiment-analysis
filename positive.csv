Attorney Jarrett Adams recently helped overturn an innocent man's conviction — in the same state that", years ago", had sentenced him to prison for a crime he did not commit.  The case was Adams' first professional win. But it was also deeply personal for the 36-year-old", who spent nearly 10 years behind bars after being wrongfully convicted of sexual assault in a case that Adams", who is black", believes was tainted by racism.  This is a storybook", Adams told NBC News' Lester Holt. It's a storybook tale that you wouldn't believe until you saw it ... to have a conviction overturned and in a court", in a state", that I was wrongfully convicted.  Adams was only 17 when an encounter at a party", an accusation", and a court-appointed attorney put his life on hold.  He had just finished high school on Chicago's South Side and decided to go to the University of Wisconsin for a party", where he and his friends met a young woman and had what he describes as a completely consensual encounter from beginning to end.  Three weeks later", as Adams was getting ready to start junior college in the fall of 1998", he was arrested. An officer informed him that the woman said she was raped", and that he was being charged with a group sexual assault along with two other teenagers.  Adams had never been arrested before. He denied the crime from the start", and thought the misunderstanding would get resolved quickly.  Instead", he was extradited to Wisconsin", where he couldn't afford legal assistance. A court-appointed attorney chose not to put on a defense", even though there was a witness who could have helped clear Adams: a student living in the dorm who could corroborate Adams' timeline of events.  Jarrett Adams Courtesy of Jarrett Adams  This guy is telling us", 'We know you didn't do it. They haven't proven their case. The best defense is a no-defense strategy",' Adams said. We're like", 'Yeah", sounds good",' because we didn't know any better", right? But in reality", it was a horrible idea to not call any witnesses", not to investigate", and to put this in front of an all-white", racially charged jury. We didn't stand a chance.  The result was a conviction with a stunning 28-year prison sentence for Adams; 20 years for another teen who couldn't pay for representation; and an acquittal for the third", who had hired a private lawyer", and called the alibi witness.  My only encounter with the criminal court system was 'Law & Order.' And at the end of those commercials", and that theme music comes on", you don't see guys who are wrongfully convicted go to prison and get sentenced to 28 years", Adams said.  Inside prison", Adams met a cellmate who worked for the prison law library and encouraged him to try to get his conviction overturned.  My only encounter with the criminal court system was 'Law & Order.' And at the end of those commercials", and that theme music comes on", you don't see guys who are wrongfully convicted go to prison and get sentenced to 28 years.  He said", 'Listen. I go over hundreds of inmates' cases", and all of them say the same thing: I'm innocent.' He said", 'I've never seen a case like yours before. You're in here for some racist bull crap", and you've essentially waved the white flag",' Adams said.  The cellmate urged him not to give up: It's only going to take a second before you have tattoos on your face and have given up and completely don't care at all. You need to go down swinging", he told Adams.  So", Adams started reading law books and found a Supreme Court case that stated that the Constitution required defendants be provided effective assistance of counsel. He got in touch with attorney Keith Findley with the Wisconsin Innocence Project", a state chapter of the nonprofit devoted to justice for wrongfully convicted people.  Findley knew the case was an uphill battle", but he took it on.  He had done his homework. He knew the case", factually", better than anybody", and he knew the law", so that he was engaging with us", discussing legal issues", strategy", Findley said.  Adams' sentence was eventually overturned and the charges dropped", for the exact reason that he had found in the prison law library books: ineffective assistance of counsel.  A month after he was freed in 2007", Adams enrolled in community college", went on to earn his Bachelor's degree and attended law school", graduating in 2015.  Last summer", he became the first Innocence Project exonoree to be hired as an attorney by the organization.  What I wanted more than anything was this: I wanted my mother", when she went to church and people asked about her son", for her not to duck her head in her Bible and cry. And I wanted her to be proud", he said.  Recently", Adams found himself back in a Wisconsin courtroom", this time working side-by-side with his former attorney Findley", to free another man they believed was wrongfully convicted.  Richard Beranek was convicted of rape in 1990. Although he had alibi witnesses that put him in another state at the time of the rape", the jury found the testimony of an FBI expert tying him to the scene through a microscopic hair analysis convincing enough to deliver a guilty verdict.  Adams — who served time in the same correctional facility as his client — was dedicated to freeing him", Findley said.  I can talk to Richard about what I've seen other exonerees go through", what the experience looks like from the outside", but I couldn't do what Jarrett can do. I couldn't speak with the authenticity of knowing what it feels like", that Jarrett can speak to", Findley said.  In June", a Dane County circuit judge overturned Beranek's conviction", citing DNA evidence that proves the FBI hair analysis was wrong. Beranek is now a free man", in large part thanks to Adams' tireless work.  Nothing pays me back more", or my family", than me walking in the same court", in the same state", where they didn't even look at me when they gave me 28 years", Adams said. But now they have to acknowledge me as 'Attorney Adams.'
The Amazon Rainforest is well known across the world for being the largest and most dense area of woodland in the world. Spanning across nine countries", the Amazon is home to millions of different animal and plant species", as well as harboring some for the world’s last remaining indigenous groups. The Waorani people of Pastaza are an indigenous tribe from the Ecuadorian Amazon and have lived in the Rainforest for many generations. However", there Home came under threat from a large oil company - they didn’t take it lightly.  Legal Win  After a long legal battle with a number of organizations", the Waorani people successfully protected half a million acres of their ancestral territory in the Amazon rainforest from being mined for oil drilling by huge oil corporations. The auctioning off of Waorani lands to the oil companies was suspended indefinitely by a three-judge panel of the Pastaza Provincial Court. The panel simply trashed the consultation process the Ecuadorian government had undertaken with the tribe in 2012", which rendered the attempt at land purchase null and void.  This win for the indigenous tribe has now set an invaluable legal precedent for other indigenous nations across the Ecuadorian Amazon. After accepting a Waorani bid for court protection to stop an oil bidding process", the court also halted the potential auctioning off of 16 oil blocks that cover over 7 million acres of indigenous territory.  Government Corruption  While there is no evidence", some people believe that the Ecuadorian government may be accepting bribes in some roundabout way. The land in question is meant to be protected under Ecuador’s constitution that establishes the inalienable", unseizable and indivisible rights of indigenous people to maintain possession of their ancestral lands and obtain their free adjudication.  Furthermore", the constitution also states that there is a need for prior consultation on any plans to exploit the underground resources", given the probable environmental and cultural impacts on tribal communities. The government claim they did do this in 2012", however", the tribe alleges that the agreement they came to was based upon fraudulent practices in favor of the oil companies and the government was favoring their bottom line over the people the actually still live on this valuable land. Due to this", the judges ordered the Ecuadorian government to conduct a new consultation", applying standards set by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights before anything else is agreed regarding the exploitation of the natural resources below the ground.  Nemonte Nenquimo", president of the Waorani Pastaza Organization and plaintiff in the lawsuit", remarked:  “The government tried to sell our lands to the oil companies without our permission. Our rainforest is our life. We decide what happens in our lands. We will never sell our rainforest to the oil companies. Today", the courts recognized that the Waorani people", and all indigenous peoples have rights over our territories that must be respected. The government’s interests in oil is not more valuable than our rights", our forests", our lives.”  This is a major win for indigenous tribes all over the Ecuadorian Amazon rainforest", and even perhaps the Amazon as a whole! This has definitely set a new precedent regarding indigenous peoples’ rights over the land they live in and offers them a glimmer of hope in protecting their cultural heritage. They’ll definitely need plenty of support in the coming years as economical advances", such as this one will keep coming more and more as the world becomes ever growingly desperate for the natural resources that the beautiful land holds.
Newark police: No officer fired a single shot in 2020", thanks to de-escalation program  Newark police and city officials say a de-escalation training program is working", especially in a year faced with challenges.  Public Safety Director Anthony Ambrose says 2020 was the roughest year in his 34-year career in law enforcement.  Six of their 1",100 officers lost their lives to COVID-19 with dozens more officers sick after being exposed on the job.  They also faced major challenges during the summer's anti-police brutality protests.  Through it all", Ambrose says not one officer in the city fired his or her weapon while on duty in 2020.  It was the unknown. It was the unknown that you didn’t know with this disease that you were coming here every day", and these police officers and firefighters going out there", and we didn't know", says Ambrose.  For Newark police", it was a year of COVID-19 fears", obstacles and losses.  “We lost six police officers and going to six funerals", it all wears on you", Ambrose says.  There was also the major tension on the streets of the city", following the death of George Floyd.  “We had protests", and they tried to take over of one of our precincts", Ambrose says.  2020 was tough for the Newark Police Department. But despite all of that", top brass report an impressive statistic to round out 2020.  Ambrose says not one police officer fired a weapon in 2020. He credits a de-escalation program implemented in Newark two years go.  These things", it takes time for it to work. And I think it worked", Ambrose says.  Overall crime was down 6% this year. The city saw 51 homicides", the same as 2019. Non-fatal shootings were up in the city", and 61 of them had multiple victims.  But more guns were taken off the streets. Police officers recovered 496 illegal firearms", a 7% increase over last year when officers took 461 illegal weapons off the street.  I'm proud of the men and women of Newark police division who took the guns off the street this year. Didn't fire a shot", came to work during a pandemic", arrested people with guns during the pandemic", Ambrose says.  Ambrose says the true test of that training was on May 30 during a Black Lives Matter protest in which about 1",700 people swarmed a precinct in an attempt to take it over. Not one shot was fired during the incident and nobody was severely injured.  Last year", police fired five shots", but there are no details on whether that was at one incident or multiple.
I 1970 døde det 560 mennesker i den norske trafikken", og direktør Ingrid Dahl Hovland i Statens vegvesen mener det siden den gang har vært en gledelig utvikling.  – Vi er flinke til å sikre våre barn i bil", men jeg skulle ønske vi var like flinke å sikre de voksne. Våre analyser av dødsulykkene viser at 33 prosent av alle som omkom i en bil", ikke har brukt sikkerhetsbelter. Mange av disse ville ha reddet livet om de hadde brukt sikkerhetsbelte", mener Hovland.  Omkomne barn i trafikken (inntil 16 år) 2019 0 2018 1 2017 4 2016 2 2015 3 2014 5 2013 5 2012 4 2011 7 2010 5  Dyster desember  Vegdirektør Ingrid Dahl Hovland er fornøyd med utviklingen når det gjelder barn som omkommer i den norske trafikken. Foto: Knut Opeide  I hele landet omkom 110 personer i trafikken i 2019", og det er to flere enn i 2018. I desember mistet 14 personer livet i trafikken", som er mer enn en dobling fra desember i fjor hvor seks personer omkom.  – Vi er ikke fornøyd med at vi ikke får dødstallene ytterligere ned. Bak hver eneste ulykke er det en tragedie som rammer familie", venner", kolleger og lokalsamfunn", sier Ingrid Dahl Hovland.  Antallet omkomne for de tre siste årene ligger omtrent på samme nivå", og ligger på mellom 106 og 110 omkomne.  – Før desember hadde vi et lite håp om at 2019 kunne bli et år med færrest omkomne i trafikken noensinne. Dessverre ble desember en langt dystrere måned i trafikken enn forventet", og vi er fortsatt langt unna nullvisjonen om at ingen skal omkomme eller bli hardt skadd i trafikken.  – Vi må derfor styrke innsatsen betydelig innen trafikksikkerhetsarbeid i årene som kommer. Det er langt igjen før vi er der vi skal være", mener direktør i Trygg Trafikk", Jan Johansen.  Slik sikrer du barna best i bilen Ekspandér faktaboks Stram beltet over skulder og hofte", ned mot lår. Pass på at beltet ikke ligger over magen", under armen", bak ryggen eller brukes på andre oppfinnsomme måter. Sjekk jevnlig at beltet sitter som det skal. Ta av tykke ytterjakker og -dresser. Sjekk at telefon", nettbrett og andre gjenstander ikke ligger løst i bilen. Kilde: Trygg Trafikk  Mange ulykker med tunge kjøretøy  I nesten hver tredje dødsulykke i fjor var tunge kjøretøy involvert. Det betyr at tunge kjøretøy har vært involvert i 36 av dødsulykkene i fjor. Dette er det høyeste antallet de siste fem årene.  Direktør Jan Johansen i Trygg Trafikk er bekymret over alle dødsulykkene hvor tunge kjøretøy er involvert. Foto: Trygg Trafikk  – Det er mange tunge kjøretøy på veiene og dette kommer bare til å øke i tiden framover. Ulykkesanalysene viser at det ofte ikke er sjåføren i det tunge kjøretøyet som har skyld i ulykken", og derfor må vi bilister være ekstra oppmerksomme", sier Johansen.  Flest ulykker i Nordland  16 personer mistet livet i trafikken i Nordland i 2019", og det var verst i hele landet.  – Tallene for Nordland er bekymringsfulle. Nordland har mange smale og svingete veier av dårlig standard og det er det nødvendig med tiltak både når det gjelder infrastruktur for å heve veistandarden", sier Jan Johansen i Trygg Trafikk.  Trafikktall for 2019 Ekspandér faktaboks I hele landet omkom 110 personer i trafikken i 2019", og det er to flere enn i 2018. 16 personer mistet livet i trafikken i Nordland", og det er en kraftig økning fra 2018", da fem personer omkom. Bak følger Akershus (14)", Trøndelag (11) og Møre og Romsdal (10). Finnmark", Oslo og Aust-Agder hadde færrest dødsulykker med en drept i hvert av disse fylkene. I 2019 omkom 79 menn og 31 kvinner i den norske trafikken. Det betyr at over 71 prosent av de omkomne var menn. Dødsfall i trafikken øker mest i aldersgruppen 25-44", mens det er størst nedgang i gruppen 45-64 år.    I 2019 var det dobbelt så mange bilpassasjerer som omkom enn året før. Det er likevel fortsatt flest bilførere som dør i trafikken. I fjor var det ingen dødsulykker med moped", og det har ikke skjedd siden 2010.  Statens vegvesen lover fortsatt storsatsing mot trafikkdøden og alvorlig skadde i trafikken.  – Vårt viktigste våpen er kunnskap. Vi analyserer alle dødsulykkene", og denne kunnskapen gjør at vi kan sette inn tiltak som vi vet virker og som har stor effekt. Arbeidet vil fortsette systematisk og langsiktig på bred front med uforminsket styrke", sier vegdirektør Ingrid Dahl Hovland.
Budweiser will not be running a commercial during the Super Bowl for the first time in 37 years.  Instead", the Anheuser-Busch InBev beer will use the marketing dollars to support Covid-19 vaccine awareness and access.  As of Friday", roughly 39 million vaccines doses had been distributed and only 19.1 million administered", falling well short of the targets set by the federal government.  In the week leading up to Super Bowl LV", Budweiser plans to run its Super Bowl ad digitally. The spot focuses on resilient Americans during the coronavirus pandemic", including a group of health-care workers who were the first to receive the vaccine. Actress Rashida Jones", known for her roles in The Office and Parks and Recreation", will narrate the spot.  The beer brand also plans to donate a percentage of its advertising airtime for 2021 to the Ad Council and Covid Collaborative's Vaccine Education Initiative. Budweiser will support its efforts with additional campaigns throughout the year.  Alice Sylvester", the co-founder of Sequent Partners", a marketing measurement analytics consultancy", said that Budweiser is taking purpose-driven marketing to the next level and differentiating itself from Super Bowl advertisers whose commercials will air during the game.  It speaks to the long tail impact of Super Bowl advertising", which is as much about brand building than it is about short term revenue generation", Sylvester said.  The company also isn't entirely giving up promoting its beer. Budweiser is giving U.S. consumers who are at least 21 years old a free beer when they visit ABeerOnBud.com between Jan. 25 and Feb. 7. AB InBev's other brands", including Michelob Ultra", Bud Light and Bud Light Seltzer Lemonade", will have in-game ads during the Super Bowl.  Budweiser isn't the only iconic brand sitting out the game. PepsiCo and Coca-Cola have said they won't be running in-game ads for their namesake sodas. Pepsi is instead focusing on its sponsorship of the halftime show", which stars The Weeknd. PepsiCo's other brands", including Mtn Dew and Frito-Lay", are planning on airing commercials during the game.  In a statement to CNBC", Coke said it has chosen to focus on investing in the right resources. The pandemic has upended the beverage giant's business because fewer drinks are being consumed away from home. Its revenue fell 13% during the first nine months of 2020.  Last year's Super Bowl drew about 100 million viewers", but attracting those eyeballs comes with a hefty price tag for advertisers. A 30-second commercial during the football game will set companies back about $5.5 million this year", slightly less than 2020's rate of $5.6 million.  Shares of Budweiser parent AB InBev have fallen 14.5% in the last year", giving the company a market value of about $113 billion. While at-home consumption of beer is up due to the pandemic", the blow to bars and sports stadiums has resulted in a 6.8% revenue decline during the first nine months of 2020.

Over the past few years", Nadia's commitment to litter picking on her cycle to school has made headlines.  Last January we ran a story about her achievements and how children at her local school had bullied her", naming her 'Trash Girl'", a title she has since proudly owned.  After the article went viral", the bullying eased off for a few months but then escalated again.  Team Trash Girl List of eco things you can do - Credit: Archant  You may also want to watch:  Unfortunately", she felt her school did not support her and she says she was disappointed when the headteacher suggested she give up litter picking to ease off the bullies.  Despite this", Nadia continued to litter pick and has now gained a large following on Instagram and Facebook", with supporters worldwide.  Last year Nadia was honoured as part of our Stars of Norfolk and Waveney Awards", withher prize being that she spent time in the newsroom showing us the importance of recycling and what things to look out for on a litter pick.

Botnet beast: How to slay the DDoS dragon Watch Now  A Russian-speaking grey-hat hacker is breaking into people's MikroTik routers and patching devices so they can't be abused by cryptojackers", botnet herders", or other cyber-criminals", ZDNet has learned.  The hacker", who goes by the name of Alexey and says he works as a server administrator", claims to have disinfected over 100",000 MikroTik routers already.  Alexey has not been trying to hide his actions and has boasted about his hobby on a Russian blogging platform. He says he accesses routers and makes changes to their settings to prevent further abuse.  Also: Best VPN services of 2020: Safe and fast don't come for free  I added firewall rules that blocked access to the router from outside the local network", Alexey said. In the comments", I wrote information about the vulnerability and left the address of the @router_os Telegram channel", where it was possible for them to ask questions.  But despite adjusting firewall settings for over 100",000 users", Alexey says that only 50 users reached out via Telegram. A few said thanks", but most were outraged.  The vigilante server administrator says he's been only fixing routers that have not been patched by their owners against a MikroTik vulnerability that came to light in late April.  At the time", the vulnerability (known as CVE-2018-14847) was a zero-day", but MikroTik rolled out a fix in record time. Nonetheless", cyber-criminals quickly jumped on board to exploit the flaw.  CVE-2018-14847 is a very convenient vulnerability because it allows an attacker to bypass authentication and download the user database file. Attackers decrypt this file and then use one of the username & password combos to log into a remote device and make OS settings and run various scripts.  For the past five and a half months", the vulnerability has been mainly used to plant cryptojacking scripts on outdated MikroTik routers [1", 2] and to hijack DNS servers and later redirect user traffic towards malicious sites [1", 2].  This wouldn't be an issue", but MikroTik is one of today's most popular router brand. There are over two million MikroTik routers around the globe.  Security researcher Troy Mursch told ZDNet today that of the millions of MikroTik routers currently connected to the Internet", over 420",000 show signs they've been infected with cryptocurrency-mining scripts.  Speaking to ZDNet today", Ankit Anubhav", a security researcher for NewSky Security", has also indicated that DDoS botnet authors have also been trying to infect and corral these devices under their control", but failing.  The usual IoT blackhat botnet factory is basically clueless about the exploit", and how it can be deployed for a proper functioning botnet", Anubhav said.  Instead", he says the people placing cryptocurrency-mining scripts on the devices are far more adept at hijacking the vulnerable routers. Anubhav speculated that this looks to be the work of a knowledgeable lone actor.  Things became even worse for the MikroTik community this past week after Tenable researchers released a new exploit named By The Way for the original CVE-2018-14847 vulnerability. This spurred new interest from the botnet community.  But the reason why Alexey was able to clean over 100",000 routers is because none of the hacker groups currently abusing MikroTik routers appear to perform basic hygiene.  The attackers are not closing [device ports] or patching the devices", so anyone who wants to further mess with these routers", can", Anubhav told ZDNet.  Fortunately", Alexey has been doing this clean-up on some users's behalf. But technically speaking", Alexey is on the wrong side of the law. Despite his good intentions", it is illegal to access another person or organization's equipment without consent.  Alexey's vigilante spree may be illegal", but he is definitely not the first.  In 2014", a hacker accessed thousands of ASUS routers and planted text warnings inside computers with shared folders and hard drives that were located behind those routers", warning users to patch their ASUS device.  In late 2015", a team of vigilante hackers going by the name of the White Team launched the Linux.Wifatch malware that closed security holes on a variety of Linux-based routers. At one point", the White Team's botnet became so big it battled with the botnet of the infamous Lizard Squad team for the title of the Internet's largest botnet.  In 2017", a more devious vigilante hacker named The Janit0r deployed the BrickerBot malware that erased firmware or bricked IoT devices that had not been updated.  Also in 2017", a hacker made over 150",000 printers spew out a message to their owners to raise everyone's awareness about the danger of leaving printers exposed online.  In 2018", another vigilante renamed tens of thousands of MikroTik and Ubiquiti routers to HACKED and other messages to get owners' attention to update their devices.  Mursch told ZDNet that he doesn't believe the MikroTik situation will get better any time soon.  Rebooting grandma's router won't fix this", he said. Remediation efforts must be done by the service providers.  The reason is that many of these devices are not routers placed inside users' homes", but are so-called edge devices", often part of an ISP's internal infrastructure", such as routers placed in ISP boxes left inside apartment complexes or on street poles.  Another source in the infosec community who spoke to ZDNet but did not want his name shared for this story confirmed that Alexey's vigilante efforts have also touched edge routers", not only those found in people's homes.  Ironically", by cleaning some ISP routers he might get the ISPs to act and fix everyone's routers as well", the unnamed researcher told us.  As for MikroTik", the Latvian company has been one of the most responsive vendors in terms of security flaws", fixing issues within hours or days", compared to the months that some other router vendors tend to take. It would be unfair to blame this situation on them. Patches have been available for months", but", yet again", it is ISPs and home users who are failing to take advantage of them.  RELATED COVERAGE:
Colorado Gov. Jared Polis plans to mass-pardon 2",732 convictions of low-level marijuana possession through an executive order Thursday after signing a bill earlier this year that gave him that authority.  “This really catches Coloradans up with where the law is today",” he told The Denver Post.  House Bill 1424", passed by the General Assembly earlier this year", included a provision that allows the governor to pardon those who have convictions on their criminal records for possessing up to 2 ounces of marijuana — the current legal limit for medical marijuana users.  Polis’ pardon", however", will only apply to convictions in state courts through 2012 of up to 1 ounce for recreational use", consistent with Colorado Amendment 64", passed by voters in 2012.  It will not apply to convictions in municipal courts or in other states.  The governor said his office worked with the Colorado Bureau of Investigation to sort through criminal histories and determine the exact number of eligible convictions. The total number of individuals who will benefit from the pardon was not immediately available because a single person could have been convicted on more than one charge.  Unlike programs in Denver and Boulder to expunge marijuana convictions", those eligible for the pardon will not have to apply. In the first six months of Denver’s program", fewer than 1% of the 13",000 people eligible successfully got their convictions erased.  Other states have taken action to address previous low-level convictions after marijuana legalization. Nevada", for instance", automatically pardoned more than 15",000", and California has adopted an automatic expungement process for certain marijuana convictions.  Minor marijuana offenses could stand in the way of people obtaining jobs", student loans or concealed-carry permits", Polis said.  “In addition to being symbolic", (the pardon) has real-life ramifications for people",” he said.  Anyone who wants to check if Polis’ pardon will apply to them can go to comarijuanapardons.com.  The pardon won’t expunge or seal records related to the convictions", according to the governor’s office. But the convictions will be removed from individuals’ public records", so if a member of the public runs a background check", a conviction won’t show up. It would still appear in law enforcement background checks but with a note about the governor’s pardon.  That’s the next goal for Rep. James Coleman", a Denver Democrat and one of the sponsors of House Bill 1424.  “Whether it’s one or a thousand (people)", my focus is to figure out by the time I’m done in the legislature how we not only pardon these individuals but figure out how to expunge it off their records",” Coleman said.  He plans to look at more policies in the 2021 legislative session to address equity and opportunities for people to work in the cannabis industry.
Many people may not want to think about our plastic pollution problem", but it’s imperative that we do. Every year", we produce 300 million tons of plastic and around 8.8 million tons of it get dumped in the oceans", threatening countless animals", many of which are on the verge of extinction as a result. If that wasn’t bad enough", it’s now estimated that by 2050", there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish.  As one of the greatest threats to our oceans and the animals that we share the planet with", we need to rethink every single aspect of how much waste we produce and how we deal with it. That’s why 12-year-old Nadia Sparkes decided to take matters into her own hands. The high schooler has been picking up trash along the two-mile route from her school to her home for months now", using the basket of her bike to bring the trash home. In just the short amount of time that she has been picking up trash", Nadia has already accumulated more than two recycling bins worth of plastic.  Advertisement  Despite her green intentions", some of the kids at Nadia’s school have dubbed her “Trash Girl” and have bullied her for her noble efforts to help the planet. It would be easy to succumb to mean comments and stop picking up trash", but on the contrary", Nadia is more determined than ever to clean up her community.  “I’m doing something to protect the world they also live in. It’s everyone’s job. We are all responsible for keeping this world safe", instead of believing that it’s always someone else’s job",” Nadia said about the bullies.  “I told her she had two choices", she could either stop collecting rubbish", stop drawing their attention and hopefully they would leave her alone. Or she could own “trash girl",” Paula Sparkes", Nadia’s mom", said about the bullies.  As a result of the media attention Nadia has received", she now has created a Facebook group aptly named “Team Trash Girl” where she shares updates on her efforts. Positive comments have poured in", all in support of Nadia", advocating for her to ignore the negative. “Nadia", I think you’re truly awesome! Own that nickname and don’t give up. The bullies are ignorant and should be ashamed. I wish more people were just like you",” Emma Whitmore said.  Advertisement  Local artists have also shown their support by creating original artwork that boldly says “Team Trash Girl.”  If you’d like to stay up to date on Nadia’s work to rid her community of trash", you can join the “Team Trash Girl” Facebook group. At a time when our plastic pollution has become a full-blown environmental crisis", Nadia’s efforts are important now more than ever. We need more people like Nadia to proudly stand up for what they believe in!  Advertisement  What You Can Do!  A staggering 1 trillion plastic bags are used each year worldwide", according to the Earth Policy Institute. Plastic bags are made out of non-renewable resources like petroleum and natural gas", and because they take hundreds of years to decompose", when plastics do eventually degrade", they don’t biodegrade. Instead", they photodegrade", which means they break down into smaller fragments and easily soak up toxins", which then contaminate waterways", soil", and animals upon digestion of the plastic materials.  If we all make an effort to identify where we use plastic and actively look for alternatives", we can drastically cut down on the amount of plastic pollution that finds its way into the oceans. Achieving a 100 percent waste-free lifestyle is challenging", but it is certainly not impossible. Just take a look at Lauren Singer", the 25-year-old who can store all the waste she’s produced in the past few years in just a single mason jar!  Advertisement  As the leading organization at the forefront of the conscious consumerism movement", One Green Planet believes that reducing everyday plastics from our lives is not about giving up anything or sacrificing convenience", but rather learning to reap the maximum benefits from the items you use every day while having minimal impact.

HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finland’s woman-led centre-left government plans to give new fathers the same amount of paid time off work as new mothers", nearly doubling paternity leave", it announced on Wednesday.  Finland's Minister of Social Affairs and Health Aino-Kaisa Pekonen holds a news conference on the family leave reform in Helsinki", Finland February 5", 2020. Lehtikuva/Vesa Moilanen via REUTERS  Paid paternity leave will be extended to nearly seven months", in line with maternity leave. Around half can be given to the other parent. Pregnant women are also entitled to a month of pregnancy leave before the expected date of birth.  Minister of Health and Social Affairs Aino-Kaisa Pekonen said the aim of the “radical reform” was both to improve gender equality and to boost a declining birth rate.  “This enables better equality between parents and diversity among families",” she said.  The number of newborns in Finland fell by around a fifth between 2010 and 2018", to just 47",577 babies in a country of around 5.5 million people. Pekonen said other countries such as Sweden and Iceland had seen increases in their birth rates after offering more leave for fathers.  Finland’s coalition of five parties", all led by women of whom four are under 35 years old", took office in December and has made gender equality a priority.  Speaking at the 50th annual World Economic Forum meeting in Davos last month", Prime Minister Sanna Marin called for states and companies to do more to ensure women were treated fairly", saying gender equality “doesn’t happen by itself”.  A previous centre-right Finnish government attempted to reform parental leave in 2018 but eventually rejected the idea as too costly.  Pekonen said a more equal distribution of domestic workload between parents has been proven to diminish the risk of divorce.  “Over a longer term", it also improves equality in working life and in wages by directing fathers to use a larger proportion of parental leaves than before",” she said.
Standing next to the rubble of the Carlton Tavern", its patrons thought that this was just another brazen example of developers skirting the law to turn their pub into profit.  Bulldozers had sheared away the wall of the 1920s west London pub", with its distinctive tiled signage", to reveal the fully stocked bar and darts trophies still on display.  But the Carlton’s story did not follow the usual plot", where the developer presents the fait accompli to the local authority and pays a fine before pressing ahead with the redevelopment and counting their profits.  Instead", after a dogged six-year campaign by locals", the Carlton Tavern will reopen next month – lockdown permitting – after the developers were ordered to rebuild the pub “brick by brick”", a ruling that pub campaigners say has set an extraordinary precedent.  “People said it was impossible",” said Polly Robertson", a leading member of the Rebuild the Carlton Tavern campaign. “Many people said", ‘Polly", it’s not worth it", nothing’s going to happen’. And I just thought", no – I’m not going to let it lie.”  The reopening comes on 12 April", the day that Covid-19 restrictions are due to be lifted in England to let pubs and restaurants serve drinks and meals outdoors. It is a day that will be celebrated by England’s 33",305 pubs", but by none more keenly than at the Carlton in Maida Vale.  The Carlton Tavern’s last orders were in April 2015. After being denied planning permission to convert it into 10 flats", and two days before Historic England was due to recommend the pub be granted Grade-II listed status", the owners ordered its demolition.  The partially demolished Carlton Tavern in late April 2015", when the local campaign to have it restored began. Photograph: Paul Davey/Alamy  Robertson and 5",300 other locals", including several local councillors", mobilised to persuade Westminster council to act.  It ordered the owners", CTLX", to rebuild the Carlton brick by brick. A planning inquiry the following year confirmed the decision", ruling that the pub should be rebuilt “in facsimile”", from the red bricks to the distinctive tiled pub name.  “They said it would be too difficult to do", but we had an answer for that",” Robertson said. “We had a suspicion before the demolition that they would do something", so we asked Historic England to think about listing it. They took a plaster cast of every tile", they took pictures and documented everything.”  With nowhere left to turn", the developers started the rebuild. “And to be fair to [CTLX]", they have done amazing work",” Robertson said. “It looks fantastic.”  Although praise for the demolishers goes only so far. “I doubt they will be [at the reopening]. The community would eat them alive",” she said.  Polly Robertson", local campaigner", with the Carlton Tavern’s new owners", Tom Rees and Ben Martin (right). Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer  The Carlton Tavern’s wooden doors", fittings and tiled signs are remarkably similar to photographs taken before 2015. The new leaseholders are Tom Rees and Ben Martin", who set up Homegrown Pubs last year", and they are still putting the finishing touches to the fit-out.  “Lots of parts of the bar and the fireplace", the bannister", have been reclaimed from the rubble",” Rees said. “The pub tells its story from the half-broken fixtures that we’ve got. You can see bits of broken wood – it’s not all perfect", which we really love because it gives character and charm to the building.”  Rees and Martin have restored the cellar", which will be stocked by local London brewers including the Camden Town Brewery", Five Points from Hackney", the London Brewing Co", and Anspach & Hobday.  “Ben and I have been running pubs and restaurants for a long time", and we decided to set up our company",” Rees said. “I live locally and I knew about the pub. This has happened multiple times in different places and there’s never been a result like this.  “From the outside", it seems like a totally mad thing to do – setting up a pub company during the middle of the pandemic. But", from the inside", landlords have had the upper hand with leaseholders for ever", so this was an opportunity to level the playing field across the industry.”  The new Carlton will focus more on food", although Rees fights shy of the word “gastropub”.  “We want it to be a great little boozer where you can come and have some pints of cask any day of the week", but we’ll also have a nice dining area out the back. We hope we can be everything to everyone.”  James Watson", the pub protection adviser for the Campaign for Pubs", advised the Carlton campaign. “I never imagined that I would see a planning inspector order a developer to put back what he’d just knocked down", to look exactly as it was. I thought the developer would get a slap on the wrist", a £6",000 fine. But I was flabbergasted – and it has set an incredibly useful precedent. Other planning inspectors will remember it", and so will developers.”  Watson was involved in campaigning for legislation in 2017 that went some way to stopping pubs from being converted into shops under permitted development rules – full planning permission is now required.  “Most developers tend to be slightly smarter than sending in the bulldozers",” he said. “The age-old trick is to take some tiles off the roof and let the rain in. The beams rot", it collapses and they say to the council", ‘This is a derelict site that needs to be rebuilt as flats.’”  Councils in Cambridge and London are questioning this method more and more", Watson said. “They’re challenging these Trojan horse attacks on pubs", where they say they’re going to put a bike shed in the basement and a gym upstairs and", suddenly", your pub space is just a lock-up.  “We need other councils around the country to do the same",” he said. “Planning officers need to be wise to these tricks.”
Aldi has increased its hourly rates of pay for staff after breaking the £12bn sales barrier for the first time.  Last year Aldi reported record earnings in the UK and Ireland against a increasingly fragile retail sector. It also enjoyed a strong Christmas.  Read more: The freshest exclusives and sharpest analysis", curated for your inbox Email address is invalid Thank you for subscribing! Sorry", there was a problem with your subscription. Aldi donates all unsold fresh food to charity for Christmas  The German discounter has again touted itself as the UK’s best-paying supermarket after it increased wages for all employees.  The company said all store assistants will from February earn £9.10 per hour outside the M25", and £10.55 in London. Interestingly", Aldi said all workers are paid the same flat rate", however old they are.  Employees previously earned £8.85 per hour and £10.20 per hour respectively.  Real living wage  Regionally", Aldi’s pay exceeds the UK’s “real living wage”", which is encouraged by the Living Wage Foundation and is more than the Government’s statutory boundaries. Many feel the Government’s rates are too low.  In London", the supermarket’s new £10.55 wage matches the charity’s voluntary minimum. Aldi also told i that store managers start on £44",890", which is almost £20",000 more than a junior doctor’s starting salary", and more than double that of a police officer beginning their career.  While Aldi’s rates of pay are notable", it’s worth pointing out that the company employs fewer members of staff per store than traditional supermarkets like Sainsbury’s and Waitrose. Aldi has around 40 members of staff in each shop", while rivals require far more – usually more than double.  The budget chain is able to make do with fewer workers thanks to its more efficient operating system – shelves don’t need stacking because food products are put up still in boxes", for example", and checkouts run quicker as customers bag their own groceries. There are numerous other cost-saving mechanisms.  Tesco launched its discount spin-off Jack’s based on a similar model touting speed and simplicity. Jack’s also functions with fewer team members than classic Tesco branches. Staff pay at Jack’s is £9 per hour – 10p less than Aldi.  New store plans  Aldi’s pay rise comes as high street stores continue to struggle. At Waitrose", staff – or “partners” as they are known – are given a yearly bonus in addition to their wages", but this year they may not get one for the first time since 1953.    Giles Hurley", CEO for Aldi UK", said: “Our store colleagues do a fantastic job every day and the excellent service they provide to customers is a key reason why we are the UK’s fastest-growing supermarket.  “We’re committed to being the best supermarket employer in Britain and this means rewarding our colleagues for the excellent job they do with market-leading rates of pay and opportunities to progress their career at Aldi.”  Aldi now has more than 800 stores across the UK and plans to open a further 65 in 2019. The company said it will be creating around 2",500 new jobs in the process.  The German chain wants to have 1",200 branches in the UK by the end of 2025. Morrisons and co. must be worried.
Politics DEA finally ends fed monopoly on schwaggy research-grade cannabis Bruce Kennedy May 18", 2021 For decades", American researchers have been forced to use only poor-quality", low-THC cannabis grown by a Mississippi contractor. Now the DEA is allowing others", who know how to grow good cannabis", to supply research-grade weed to scientists. (AdobeStock)  Late last week", the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) quietly made an announcement that’s expected to have a profound and long-lasting impact on cannabis research and development in the United States.  In its statement", the DEA said it was “nearing the end of its review of certain marijuana grower applications", thereby allowing it to soon register additional entities authorized to produce marijuana for research purposes.”  In other words", the feds are ending their monopoly on cannabis grown for scientific purposes. And that means American researchers can", for the first time ever", conduct studies using real-world cannabis instead of the terrible low-THC schwag they’ve been forced to use for decades.  NIDA monopoly since 1968  There are several reasons why this is a big deal. Since 1968", the only federally approved supplier of cannabis for research purposes in the United States has been a 12-acre farm run by the National Center for the Development of Natural Products at the University of Mississippi. That production has been exclusively for the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)", which maintains control over the production and distribution of research-grade cannabis in the United States.  Over the years", the Mississippi weed farm has earned a notorious reputation for growing some of the worst cannabis in the world. Leafly’s Ben Adlin documented the shockingly poor quality in this 2017 article:  Smoking 25% THC", studying 8% THC  The poor quality and low potency of the government-grown cannabis has been an ongoing issue for U.S. cannabis researchers.  The inadequacy of NIDA cannabis has led to some high-profile academic disputes", lawsuits and national headlines", as well as well-founded accusations that the DEA was dragging its feet on the issue. In 2017 Rick Doblin", founder and executive director of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) declared that NIDA was “completely inadequate as a source of marijuana for drug development research.”  For years", NIDA and the DEA have promised to open up the sourcing of federally-approved research cannabis. But nothing happened.  Related Wasn’t the DEA going to let others grow research-grade cannabis?  DEA finally relents  On May 14", however", the DEA announced that “a number of manufacturers’ applications to cultivate marijuana for research needs in the United States appears to be consistent with applicable legal standards and relevant laws.”  As a result", and pending final approval", the agency has given preliminary approval to several organizations to grow cannabis for research.  At the moment only three organizations have been publicly named as approved new growers for research: Pennsylvania-based Groff North America", the Scottsdale Research Institute (SRI) in Arizona", and Biopharmaceutical Research Company (BRC) in California.  ‘Monumental step’  For George Hodgin", a former Navy SEAL who is the founder and CEO of BRC", the DEA’s announcement is nothing but good news.  “Up until now", research institutions", biotech firms and other private companies had few", if any", options for federally legal cannabis R&D",” he said in an email to Leafly. “This monumental step from the DEA means that BRC can now position itself as that all-in-one source for reliable and safe research and cultivation.”  Hodgin noted that companies like his also want research organizations to have more choices in the marketplace; ensuring that “the quality of the product is comparable to the supply used by cannabis patients as well as recreational users.”  The DEA announcement", he added", will “unleash a new wave of job creation in the cannabis sector and at the same time begin to develop valuable American IP [intellectual property]. This just wasn’t really possible before this decision.”  Real-world cannabis finally available  For Matthew Zorn", a Houston-based attorney", the DEA’s decision is historic. Zorn was the co-lead lawyer in a Freedom of Information (FOIA) lawsuit", “Scottsdale Research v. DOJ/DEA",” filed last year. As a result of that lawsuit", filed on behalf of SRI", the Department of Justice released a previously confidential memo from 2018 that concluded the DEA’s long-standing policy on marijuana research violated federal law", as well as U.S. treaty obligations.  SRI has made cannabis research headlines for years now", most recently for groundbreaking studies administered by Sue Sisley", a medical doctor who conducted clinic trials with military veterans to determine if cannabis is a safe and well-tolerated treatment for managing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and pain.  With the DEA announcement", Zorn told Leafly", “scientists will be able to clinically study the types of cannabis that are being used", with real-world cannabis. A lot of people may not appreciate the importance of that", with [national cannabis] legalization around the corner. We don’t know when", but the need for this research is urgent. We can as quickly as possible start growing and have a supply for researchers to get good data.”  Breaking down barriers to research  The promise to end NIDA’s cannabis monopoly", Zorn noted", is the first step towards addressing the longstanding argument by cannabis legalization opponents", that there’s no rigorous data in the U.S. that has shown the medicinal benefits of cannabis.  “Everything’s been limited to observational studies",” he said", “and it’s true clinical studies have taken place overseas. But the biggest criticism right now against medicinal marijuana and marijuana legalization more generally is that there isn’t enough data and research. That is directly traceable to this NIDA monopoly. And now", hopefully", we’re going to get answers.”  Fueling innovation in the cannabis sector  For his part BRC’s George Hodgin sees the start of a new era of cannabis research and development", fueled in part by a new players in the marketplace.  “Now there’s competition", which this space has needed so badly for such a long time",” he said. “We’re ready to compete", that’s what we’ve been waiting for years to do. The decision to issue these licenses", in my view", will lead to an incredible rush of innovation in the healthcare space.”  But according to Hodgin", these developments will depend on more than rapid change. “Quality is just as important",” he said. “You can have the best research institutions in the world researching cannabis", but if the quality of the samples does not match what is actually in use", the research isn’t all that helpful. So", I think the competition will increase the speed", there’s not a doubt about that", but I also think the quality is going to be a crucial part of driving the innovation as well.”  Bruce Kennedy Bruce Kennedy is an award-winning reporter", editor", and producer based in Colorado.

Wang Enlin", who has just three years of education", has won the first instance of a high-profile case in China  A Chinese farmer has spent 16 years studying law by himself so he could sue a chemical company for allegedly polluting his land.  Wang Enlin", who had just three years of education", has won the first instance in a high-profile case against state-owned Qihua Group", reported the People's Daily Online.  Although Qihua Group", whose assets exceed two billion yuan (£233 million)", has appealed against the decision", the elderly man said he is determined to seek justice for himself and his neighbours who could no longer grow healthy crops on their contaminated land.  Mr Wang", who is in his 60s", lives in the Yushutun village on the outskirts of Qiqihar in the Heilongjiang Province", according to People's Daily Online", which cited China Youth Daily.  The man said he would forever remember the year of 2001 when his land was flooded by the toxic waste discharged by Qihua Group.  It was the eve of the Lunar New Year", and Mr Wang was playing cards and making dumplings with his neighbours. All of sudden", they realised that the house they were in was flooded by the wastewater from the nearby Qihua factory.  The wastewater also flooded part of the farmland in the village.  According to the report", a government document from 2001 claimed that the affected farmland 'can not be used for a long time' due to the pollution.  Between 2001 to 2016", it has been suggested that Qihua continued to dump hazardous waste into the village", whose residents rely upon agriculture for a living.  The company produced polyvinyl chloride and released 15",000 to 20",000 tons of chemical waste every year", the report said.  Qihua has also reportedly created a 71-acre wasteland with calcium carbide residue and a 478-acre pond with its liquid waste.  A picture released by People's Daily Online shows that the Qihua Group has dumped 71 acres of calcium carbide residue in the village of Yushutun", where Mr Wang lives  In 2001", Mr Wang wrote a letter to the Land Resources Bureau of Qiqihar to complain about the pollution Qihua had brought to his village.  He said while dealing with the local officials", he was repeatedly asked to produce evidence to prove that the village's land had been polluted.  Mr Wang told a reporter: 'I knew I was in the right", but I did not know what law the other party had broken or whether or not there was evidence.' He received the interview in his small home which he spent 50 yuan (£5.8) per month renting from the village's authority.  As a result", Mr Wang decided to study law by himself", an endeavour he would carry on pursuing for the next 16 years.  The farmer", who had dropped out of primary school at the third grade", started reading through a dozen law books with the help of a dictionary.  At the time", he did not have money to buy the books", so he spent day after day reading the books at the local book store and copying the relevant information by hand", according to the man. In return", he would give bags of free corn to the shopkeeper for letting him stay there.  Not only that", he also used the legal knowledge he had learnt to help his neighbours gather evidence. Their farms had also been polluted by Qihua Group", said Mr Wang.  Mr Wang", who is in his 60s", lives in the Yushutun village on the outskirts of Qiqihar (pictured)  In 2007", a Chinese law firm specialised in handling pollution-related cases started providing free legal advice to Mr Wang and his neighbours. They also agreed to help the villagers file petition to the court.  However due to unspecified complications", the court only began processing Mr Wang and his neighbours' case in 2015 - eight years after the original petition had been made", People's Daily Online reported.  Thanks to the evidence Mr Wang had gathered in the 16 years", Mr Wang and his neighbours apparently won the first instance.  The Angangxi District Court of Qiqihar ruled that the families in Yushutun village would receive financial compensation from Qihua Group amounting 820",000 yuan (£96",000). The date of the first instance was not revealed in the report.  Qihua Group has appealed against the court's decision. The case is being processed at the Angangxi District Court as of writing.  A determined Mr Wang told the reporter: 'We will certainly win. Even if we lose", we will continue to battle.'
Britney Spears", said by her lawyers to be chafing under the 12-year guardianship of her father", has filed an official petition seeking to have him removed as her conservator.  According to documents filed Tuesday in probate court in Los Angeles", the pop star requested the resignation of James Jamie Spears as her personal conservator.  She seeks to replace him with Jodi Montgomery", a state-appointed conservator who has temporarily acted as her personal conservator since her father relinquished the role in September 2019 amid health issues.  Britney Spears also reserved the right to petition for the permanent termination of her conservatorship under the state Probate Code.  In an attachment", her lawyer sought to ensure that Montgomery would have the power to make medical decisions", communicate with her doctors and have access to her medical records. She also would be able to limit Britney's visitors with the exception of her lawyer", retain caretakers and security guards on a 24/7 basis", and prosecute civil harassment restraining orders deemed appropriate.  The petition does not make clear whether Britney Spears intends for Jamie Spears to retain his other role as conservator of her finances. His lawyers have argued to the probate court hearing the case that he has greatly improved her financial estate", now worth around $60 million.  But a separate document in the court file shows that Jamie Spears and Bessemer Trust", his co-conservator of her finances", will have the power to access all documents and records relating to her assets", and to take actions necessary to secure them", in addition to a host of other powers typically wielded by financial managers.  The petition to remove Jamie Spears may be a direct result of what his lawyer", Vivian Thoreen", said publicly last month in response to criticism on social media and in a new documentary about his daughter's long conservatorship.  She said fans who accuse Jamie Spears of mistreating his daughter have it so wrong.  (Jamie) would love nothing more than to see Britney not need a conservatorship", Thoreen told CNN on Feb. 25. Whether or not there is an end to the conservatorship really depends on Britney. If she wants to end her conservatorship", she can file a petition to end it.  After public sentiment began building for the #FreeBritney movement", and attacks on Jamie Spears mounted", Thoreen tried to advocate on behalf of her client.  Jamie is not suggesting that he is the perfect dad or that he would receive any 'Father of the Year' award. Like any parent", he doesn't always see eye-to-eye on what Britney may want", she told CNN. But Jamie believes every single decision he has made has been in her best interest.  USA TODAY has reached out to Thoreen for comment. Britney's lawyer", Samuel Ingham", declined comment.  Britney Spears", 39", has been under a state conservatorship", as guardianship is called in California", since the end of 2008", following a mental-health breakdown. Her father", 68", has been either a co-conservator or sole conservator during most of the period she has been under supervision of the probate court.  Until recently", she continued her climb as a pop superstar", becoming a multimillionaire with a string of platinum-selling records", taking a gig as a X Factor judge and becoming the reigning queen of Las Vegas residencies.  By the start of 2019", when she abruptly suspended her Las Vegas show because of her father's health issues", fans began demanding to know why she still needed a guardian looking after her.  In 2020", Britney Spears's lawyers began attempting to get her father removed as her conservator", saying she was strongly opposed to him remaining in the role.  In November", her lawyer told the court she no longer wanted her father involved in her care", that she is afraid of him and would refuse to perform if he remained in charge.
A court verdict in Athens with ramifications for the far right across Europe has been met with jubilation in Greece and internationally after judges ruled the neo-fascist Golden Dawn was a criminal organisation in disguise.  Tens of thousands of people who had converged near the heavily guarded court complex in Athens in anticipation of the judgment roared in excitement as the news emerged. Many broke into spontaneous applause and punched the air as it became clear that the three-member tribunal had found the far-right group guilty of operating a gang of hit squads bent on eliminating perceived enemies.  “It’s official. Golden Dawn is over. The conviction is overwhelming",” said Petros Constantinou", a leading anti-racism activist. “The mood here today is resonant of the celebrations we saw with the liberation of Athens from the Nazis. It’s a great day.”  Wrapping up a trial that began in April 2015", the presiding judge", Maria Lepenioti", said the court had concluded that seven of Golden Dawn’s 18 former MPs", including the party founder", Nikolaos Michaloliakos", had led the deadly organisation. The rest were found culpable of participating in the gang.  00:40 Greek court's ruling on Golden Dawn party met with jubilation – video  The verdict was met with widespread relief. Magda Fyssa", whose son Pavlos Fyssas", an anti-fascist rapper", was stabbed to death by a senior party operative", and who attended almost every court session over the past five and half years", screamed with emotion. “Pavlos did it! My son",” she wailed outside the courtroom.  The Greek president", Katerina Sakellaropoulou", said the judgment was an important day for democracy and evidence that Greek institutions were able to “fend off any attempt to undermine them.”  Before the verdict", the public prosecutor overseeing the case recommended the acquittal of many key party members in relation to the criminal organisation charge", citing lack of evidence – a recommendation that was roundly denounced by critics", who accused the magistrate of typifying the toxic influence wielded by conservatives over the justice system.  The hearing was the biggest trial of fascists since the prosecution of the Nazis at Nuremberg after the second world war.  Two thousand police officers", many brought in as backup from the countryside amid fears of violent clashes between the protesters and far-right supporters", surrounded the area near the court as helicopters and drones flew overhead. Clashes did break out as rocks and molotov cocktails were hurled at police", who responded with teargas and water cannon. The violence was attributed to a minority of anti-establishment forces.  The leftist former prime minister Alexis Tsipras", who was in the crowd", said that after years of sowing hate", poisoning Greek society and orchestrating murderous attacks", Golden Dawn fanatics would finally face justice.

We all know that",” he wrote on social media before the three-member tribunal’s decision. “On Wednesday we ought to be there to shout it loud and clear. We owe it to the history of this country", we owe it to democracy", we owe it to our children.”  Those charged with directing the criminal organisation face sentences of up to 15 years in prison. If found guilty of additional crimes", the sentences handed down by the criminal court are likely to be longer", although justice officials said it may take several days of legal proceedings before they are formally announced.  The accused vigorously denied the charges", claiming they were victims of political persecution. Michaloliakos", 62", a Holocaust denier and ardent admirer of Hitler whose neofascist beliefs began to take form during Greece’s 1967-74 military dictatorship", has described Golden Dawn as a patriotic party of ultra-nationalists. Diehards lower down the chain who have been linked to violent attacks have been disavowed by the leader.  Golden Dawn stood broadly accused of targeting immigrants", communist trade unionists", anti-fascists", leftists and gay people", culminating in the fatal stabbing of Fyssas", whose murder in September 2013 forced Greek authorities to act. A senior operative in the party", Giorgos Roupakios", confessed to killing the rapper.  Judges sitting in the court of appeals focused on specific cases including whether the group was culpable of the attempted murder of Abouzid Embarak and three other Egyptian fishermen in June 2012.

The court examined evidence that ranged from the testimonies of victims and five former Golden Dawn members now in witness protection programmes to incriminating videos snatched from the homes of party leaders", and heard that the attacks increased in frequency after the party’s entry into the Greek parliament in 2012.  At the height of Greece’s debilitating debt crisis", Golden Dawn", riding a tidal wave of popular anger with EU-mandated austerity measures", won 21 seats in the 300-member house to become the country’s third biggest political force.  In the last general election", in July last year", the neo-Nazis narrowly failed to win enough votes to win any seats in parliament", and the party has all but collapsed amid infighting and defections since then.  “The accusations against the leaders and members of Golden Dawn", including the murder of Pavlos Fyssas", expose a fissure that exists not just within Greece but across Europe and beyond",” said Nils Muižnieks", the Europe director of Amnesty. “The impact of this verdict", in what is an emblematic trial of an extreme far-right party with an aggressive anti-migrant and anti-human rights stance", will be felt far beyond Greece’s borders.”  The central Board of Jewish Communities in Greece (Kise) said the “historic verdict ... delegitimises the neo-Nazi organisations and at the same time fortifies democracy in the country”.  But it said this was no time “to let our guard down”. A Jewish cemetery in Athens was vandalised in an attack attributed to the extremists on Monday and its walls daubed with slogans used by the Third Reich.  Greece suffered appallingly under Nazi occupation", with almost all of its Jewish community sent to the gas chambers.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Defense Secretary Mark Esper has issued a policy ushering in a de facto ban on displaying the Confederate flag at U.S. military installations around the world by authorizing only certain flags that promote unity", according to a copy of his memo", seen by Reuters on Friday.

Mark Milley are seen during a House Armed Services Committee hearing on 'Department of Defense Authorities and Roles Related to Civilian Law Enforcement' in Washington", DC", U.S. July 9", 2020. Michael Reynolds/Pool via REUTERS  The decision could increase tension between Esper and Republican President Donald Trump", who has cited free speech rights in his defense of Americans who fly the Confederate flag.  “The flags we fly must accord with the military imperatives of good order and discipline", treating all our people with dignity and respect", and rejecting divisive symbols",” Esper said in the memo.  The Confederate flag was flown by breakaway Southern states that advocated for the continuation of slavery and lost the 1861-65 U.S. Civil War. Flying the flag can be offensive to many Americans", who see it as a reminder of the enslavement of Black Americans and as a symbol of white supremacy.  Supporters say the flag represents the South’s heritage and culture and", along with U.S. military bases named after Confederate generals and statues honoring them", serve as memorials to Confederate casualties in the Civil War.  Trump", who has been accused of intentionally stoking racial tensions as part of his re-election campaign", has criticized the desecration and removal of statues of Confederate and other former U.S. leaders to energize his political base  Trump has also publicly opposed renaming U.S. military bases named after Confederate generals", such as Fort Hood in Texas and Fort Bragg in North Carolina", putting him at odds with his military", whose top general has said the matter should be re-examined.  A defense official", speaking on condition of anonymity", said the White House was aware of Esper’s memo.  Esper also clashed with Trump last month by publicly opposing the deployment of active-duty troops to address civil unrest across the country following the May 25 killing of George Floyd", an African American", by a white police officer in Minneapolis.  Beyond the American flag", Esper’s memorandum cites a series of flags that can be flown on military installations", including state flags and ones to honor prisoners of war and service members who went missing in action.  The reason it does not cite the Confederate flag explicitly was to ensure that it could withstand challenges", the defense official said.  “The decision to not name a specific prohibited flag was to ensure the department-wide policy would be apolitical and withstand potential free speech political challenges",” the official said.  Most U.S. military services", including the Marine Corps", have already banned the display of Confederate flags", but Esper’s memorandum is department-wide and will affect military installations around the world.
