Mark Cuban launches generic drug company,Billionaire Mark Cuban just launched a drug company that is “dedicated to producing low-cost versions of high-cost generic drugs” and pledges “radical transparency” in pricing.,1.0,"Billionaire investor and Shark Tank star Mark Cuban has launched a generic drug company called the Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Company.

The new company's website says it is dedicated to producing low-cost versions of high-cost generic drugs and pledges to ""provide radical transparency in how we price our drugs.""

The Cost Plus company will publish the costs to manufacture, distribute and market its drugs to pharmacies. It said it adds a 15 percent margin to get its wholesale prices and make sure it remains profitable, but that there are no middlemen and no rebates for insurance companies.

""Everybody gets the same low price for every drug we make,"" the company website states.

The first drug it will produce is albendazole, an antiparasitic drug. The company is hoping to introduce more than 100 drugs by the end of 2021, as well as build a pharmaceutical factory in Dallas by 2022.



The Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Company has also partnered with Baylor College of Medicine in Houston to aid researchers in providing care for children with hookworm infection in rural Alabama.

From Defendant to Defender: One Wrongfully Convicted Man Frees Another,"Man falsely imprisoned for 10 years, uses prison library to study law and have his conviction overturned. Becomes a lawyer and is now helping overturn other false convictions.",1.0,"Attorney Jarrett Adams recently helped overturn an innocent man's conviction — in the same state that, years ago, had sentenced him to prison for a crime he did not commit.

The case was Adams' first professional win. But it was also deeply personal for the 36-year-old, who spent nearly 10 years behind bars after being wrongfully convicted of sexual assault in a case that Adams, who is black, believes was tainted by racism.

""This is a storybook,"" Adams told NBC News' Lester Holt. ""It's a storybook tale that you wouldn't believe until you saw it ... to have a conviction overturned and in a court, in a state, that I was wrongfully convicted.""

Adams was only 17 when an encounter at a party, an accusation, and a court-appointed attorney put his life on hold.

He had just finished high school on Chicago's South Side and decided to go to the University of Wisconsin for a party, where he and his friends met a young woman and had what he describes as a ""completely consensual encounter from beginning to end.""

Three weeks later, as Adams was getting ready to start junior college in the fall of 1998, he was arrested. An officer informed him that the woman said she was raped, and that he was being charged with a group sexual assault along with two other teenagers.

Adams had never been arrested before. He denied the crime from the start, and thought the misunderstanding would get resolved quickly.

Instead, he was extradited to Wisconsin, where he couldn't afford legal assistance. A court-appointed attorney chose not to put on a defense, even though there was a witness who could have helped clear Adams: a student living in the dorm who could corroborate Adams' timeline of events.

""This guy is telling us, 'We know you didn't do it. They haven't proven their case. The best defense is a no-defense strategy,'"" Adams said. ""We're like, 'Yeah, sounds good,' because we didn't know any better, right? But in reality, it was a horrible idea to not call any witnesses, not to investigate, and to put this in front of an all-white, racially charged jury. We didn't stand a chance.""

The result was a conviction with a stunning 28-year prison sentence for Adams; 20 years for another teen who couldn't pay for representation; and an acquittal for the third, who had hired a private lawyer, and called the alibi witness.

""My only encounter with the criminal court system was 'Law & Order.' And at the end of those commercials, and that theme music comes on, you don't see guys who are wrongfully convicted go to prison and get sentenced to 28 years,"" Adams said.

Inside prison, Adams met a cellmate who worked for the prison law library and encouraged him to try to get his conviction overturned.

""My only encounter with the criminal court system was 'Law & Order.' And at the end of those commercials, and that theme music comes on, you don't see guys who are wrongfully convicted go to prison and get sentenced to 28 years.""

""He said, 'Listen. I go over hundreds of inmates' cases, and all of them say the same thing: I'm innocent.' He said, 'I've never seen a case like yours before. You're in here for some racist bull crap, and you've essentially waved the white flag,'"" Adams said.

The cellmate urged him not to give up: ""It's only going to take a second before you have tattoos on your face and have given up and completely don't care at all. You need to go down swinging,"" he told Adams.

So, Adams started reading law books and found a Supreme Court case that stated that the Constitution required defendants be provided effective assistance of counsel. He got in touch with attorney Keith Findley with the Wisconsin Innocence Project, a state chapter of the nonprofit devoted to justice for wrongfully convicted people.

Findley knew the case was an uphill battle, but he took it on.

""He had done his homework. He knew the case, factually, better than anybody, and he knew the law, so that he was engaging with us, discussing legal issues, strategy,"" Findley said.

Adams' sentence was eventually overturned and the charges dropped, for the exact reason that he had found in the prison law library books: ineffective assistance of counsel.

A month after he was freed in 2007, Adams enrolled in community college, went on to earn his Bachelor's degree and attended law school, graduating in 2015.

Last summer, he became the first Innocence Project exonoree to be hired as an attorney by the organization.

""What I wanted more than anything was this: I wanted my mother, when she went to church and people asked about her son, for her not to duck her head in her Bible and cry. And I wanted her to be proud,"" he said.

Recently, Adams found himself back in a Wisconsin courtroom, this time working side-by-side with his former attorney Findley, to free another man they believed was wrongfully convicted.

Richard Beranek was convicted of rape in 1990. Although he had alibi witnesses that put him in another state at the time of the rape, the jury found the testimony of an FBI expert tying him to the scene through a microscopic hair analysis convincing enough to deliver a guilty verdict.

Adams — who served time in the same correctional facility as his client — was dedicated to freeing him, Findley said.

""I can talk to Richard about what I've seen other exonerees go through, what the experience looks like from the outside, but I couldn't do what Jarrett can do. I couldn't speak with the authenticity of knowing what it feels like, that Jarrett can speak to,"" Findley said.

In June, a Dane County circuit judge overturned Beranek's conviction, citing DNA evidence that proves the FBI hair analysis was wrong. Beranek is now a free man, in large part thanks to Adams' tireless work.

""Nothing pays me back more, or my family, than me walking in the same court, in the same state, where they didn't even look at me when they gave me 28 years,"" Adams said. ""But now they have to acknowledge me as 'Attorney Adams.'""",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/defendant-defender-one-wrongfully-convicted-man-frees-another-n788886
"Amazon Tribe Wins Lawsuit Against Big Oil, Saving Millions Of Acres Of Rainforest",Amazon tribe wins legal battle against oil companies. Preventing drilling in Amazon Rainforest,1.0,"The Amazon Rainforest is well known across the world for being the largest and most dense area of woodland in the world. Spanning across nine countries, the Amazon is home to millions of different animal and plant species, as well as harboring some for the world’s last remaining indigenous groups. The Waorani people of Pastaza are an indigenous tribe from the Ecuadorian Amazon and have lived in the Rainforest for many generations. However, there Home came under threat from a large oil company - they didn’t take it lightly.

Legal Win

After a long legal battle with a number of organizations, the Waorani people successfully protected half a million acres of their ancestral territory in the Amazon rainforest from being mined for oil drilling by huge oil corporations. The auctioning off of Waorani lands to the oil companies was suspended indefinitely by a three-judge panel of the Pastaza Provincial Court. The panel simply trashed the consultation process the Ecuadorian government had undertaken with the tribe in 2012, which rendered the attempt at land purchase null and void.

This win for the indigenous tribe has now set an invaluable legal precedent for other indigenous nations across the Ecuadorian Amazon. After accepting a Waorani bid for court protection to stop an oil bidding process, the court also halted the potential auctioning off of 16 oil blocks that cover over 7 million acres of indigenous territory.

Government Corruption

While there is no evidence, some people believe that the Ecuadorian government may be accepting bribes in some roundabout way. The land in question is meant to be protected under Ecuador’s constitution that establishes the inalienable, unseizable and indivisible rights of indigenous people to maintain possession of their ancestral lands and obtain their free adjudication.

Furthermore, the constitution also states that there is a need for prior consultation on any plans to exploit the underground resources, given the probable environmental and cultural impacts on tribal communities. The government claim they did do this in 2012, however, the tribe alleges that the agreement they came to was based upon fraudulent practices in favor of the oil companies and the government was favoring their bottom line over the people the actually still live on this valuable land. Due to this, the judges ordered the Ecuadorian government to conduct a new consultation, applying standards set by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights before anything else is agreed regarding the exploitation of the natural resources below the ground.

Nemonte Nenquimo, president of the Waorani Pastaza Organization and plaintiff in the lawsuit, remarked:

“The government tried to sell our lands to the oil companies without our permission. Our rainforest is our life. We decide what happens in our lands. We will never sell our rainforest to the oil companies. Today, the courts recognized that the Waorani people, and all indigenous peoples have rights over our territories that must be respected. The government’s interests in oil is not more valuable than our rights, our forests, our lives.”

This is a major win for indigenous tribes all over the Ecuadorian Amazon rainforest, and even perhaps the Amazon as a whole! This has definitely set a new precedent regarding indigenous peoples’ rights over the land they live in and offers them a glimmer of hope in protecting their cultural heritage. They’ll definitely need plenty of support in the coming years as economical advances, such as this one will keep coming more and more as the world becomes ever growingly desperate for the natural resources that the beautiful land holds.",https://www.disclose.tv/amazon-tribe-wins-lawsuit-against-big-oil-saving-millions-of-acres-of-rainforest-367412
"Newark police: No officer fired a single shot in 2020, thanks to de-escalation program","Newark police: No officer fired a single shot in 2020, thanks to de-escalation program",1.0,"Newark police: No officer fired a single shot in 2020, thanks to de-escalation program

Newark police and city officials say a de-escalation training program is working, especially in a year faced with challenges.

Public Safety Director Anthony Ambrose says 2020 was the roughest year in his 34-year career in law enforcement.

Six of their 1,100 officers lost their lives to COVID-19 with dozens more officers sick after being exposed on the job.

They also faced major challenges during the summer's anti-police brutality protests.

Through it all, Ambrose says not one officer in the city fired his or her weapon while on duty in 2020.

""It was the unknown. It was the unknown that you didn’t know with this disease that you were coming here every day, and these police officers and firefighters going out there, and we didn't know,"" says Ambrose.

For Newark police, it was a year of COVID-19 fears, obstacles and losses.

“We lost six police officers and going to six funerals, it all wears on you,"" Ambrose says.

There was also the major tension on the streets of the city, following the death of George Floyd.

“We had protests, and they tried to take over of one of our precincts,"" Ambrose says.

2020 was tough for the Newark Police Department. But despite all of that, top brass report an impressive statistic to round out 2020.

Ambrose says not one police officer fired a weapon in 2020. He credits a de-escalation program implemented in Newark two years go.

""These things, it takes time for it to work. And I think it worked,"" Ambrose says.

Overall crime was down 6% this year. The city saw 51 homicides, the same as 2019. Non-fatal shootings were up in the city, and 61 of them had multiple victims.

But more guns were taken off the streets. Police officers recovered 496 illegal firearms, a 7% increase over last year when officers took 461 illegal weapons off the street.

""I'm proud of the men and women of Newark police division who took the guns off the street this year. Didn't fire a shot, came to work during a pandemic, arrested people with guns during the pandemic,"" Ambrose says.

Ambrose says the true test of that training was on May 30 during a Black Lives Matter protest in which about 1,700 people swarmed a precinct in an attempt to take it over. Not one shot was fired during the incident and nobody was severely injured.

Last year, police fired five shots, but there are no details on whether that was at one incident or multiple.",https://newjersey.news12.com/newark-police-no-officer-fired-a-single-shot-in-2020-thanks-to-de-escalation-program?fbclid=IwAR1rFcNUaz69b4CsG0y_mzYQ-09k1CJYSeDgmRI6PbO2csktuHxKMswnYOw
Ingen barn døde i trafikken i 2019,No children died in traffic accidents in Norway in 2019,1.0,"I 1970 døde det 560 mennesker i den norske trafikken, og direktør Ingrid Dahl Hovland i Statens vegvesen mener det siden den gang har vært en gledelig utvikling.

– Vi er flinke til å sikre våre barn i bil, men jeg skulle ønske vi var like flinke å sikre de voksne. Våre analyser av dødsulykkene viser at 33 prosent av alle som omkom i en bil, ikke har brukt sikkerhetsbelter. Mange av disse ville ha reddet livet om de hadde brukt sikkerhetsbelte, mener Hovland.

Dyster desember

Vegdirektør Ingrid Dahl Hovland er fornøyd med utviklingen når det gjelder barn som omkommer i den norske trafikken. Foto: Knut Opeide

I hele landet omkom 110 personer i trafikken i 2019, og det er to flere enn i 2018. I desember mistet 14 personer livet i trafikken, som er mer enn en dobling fra desember i fjor hvor seks personer omkom.

– Vi er ikke fornøyd med at vi ikke får dødstallene ytterligere ned. Bak hver eneste ulykke er det en tragedie som rammer familie, venner, kolleger og lokalsamfunn, sier Ingrid Dahl Hovland.

Antallet omkomne for de tre siste årene ligger omtrent på samme nivå, og ligger på mellom 106 og 110 omkomne.

– Før desember hadde vi et lite håp om at 2019 kunne bli et år med færrest omkomne i trafikken noensinne. Dessverre ble desember en langt dystrere måned i trafikken enn forventet, og vi er fortsatt langt unna nullvisjonen om at ingen skal omkomme eller bli hardt skadd i trafikken.

– Vi må derfor styrke innsatsen betydelig innen trafikksikkerhetsarbeid i årene som kommer. Det er langt igjen før vi er der vi skal være, mener direktør i Trygg Trafikk, Jan Johansen.

Mange ulykker med tunge kjøretøy

I nesten hver tredje dødsulykke i fjor var tunge kjøretøy involvert. Det betyr at tunge kjøretøy har vært involvert i 36 av dødsulykkene i fjor. Dette er det høyeste antallet de siste fem årene.

Direktør Jan Johansen i Trygg Trafikk er bekymret over alle dødsulykkene hvor tunge kjøretøy er involvert. Foto: Trygg Trafikk

– Det er mange tunge kjøretøy på veiene og dette kommer bare til å øke i tiden framover. Ulykkesanalysene viser at det ofte ikke er sjåføren i det tunge kjøretøyet som har skyld i ulykken, og derfor må vi bilister være ekstra oppmerksomme, sier Johansen.

Flest ulykker i Nordland

16 personer mistet livet i trafikken i Nordland i 2019, og det var verst i hele landet.

– Tallene for Nordland er bekymringsfulle. Nordland har mange smale og svingete veier av dårlig standard og det er det nødvendig med tiltak både når det gjelder infrastruktur for å heve veistandarden, sier Jan Johansen i Trygg Trafikk.

Trafikktall for 2019 Ekspandér faktaboks I hele landet omkom 110 personer i trafikken i 2019, og det er to flere enn i 2018. 16 personer mistet livet i trafikken i Nordland, og det er en kraftig økning fra 2018, da fem personer omkom. Bak følger Akershus (14), Trøndelag (11) og Møre og Romsdal (10). Finnmark, Oslo og Aust-Agder hadde færrest dødsulykker med en drept i hvert av disse fylkene. I 2019 omkom 79 menn og 31 kvinner i den norske trafikken. Det betyr at over 71 prosent av de omkomne var menn. Dødsfall i trafikken øker mest i aldersgruppen 25-44, mens det er størst nedgang i gruppen 45-64 år.



I 2019 var det dobbelt så mange bilpassasjerer som omkom enn året før. Det er likevel fortsatt flest bilførere som dør i trafikken. I fjor var det ingen dødsulykker med moped, og det har ikke skjedd siden 2010.

Statens vegvesen lover fortsatt storsatsing mot trafikkdøden og alvorlig skadde i trafikken.

– Vårt viktigste våpen er kunnskap. Vi analyserer alle dødsulykkene, og denne kunnskapen gjør at vi kan sette inn tiltak som vi vet virker og som har stor effekt.

"Budweiser will sit out Super Bowl, funneling marketing dollars to boost vaccine awareness","Budweiser will sit out Super Bowl, funneling marketing dollars to boost vaccine awareness",1.0,"Budweiser will not be running a commercial during the Super Bowl for the first time in 37 years.

Instead, the Anheuser-Busch InBev beer will use the marketing dollars to support Covid-19 vaccine awareness and access.

As of Friday, roughly 39 million vaccines doses had been distributed and only 19.1 million administered, falling well short of the targets set by the federal government.

In the week leading up to Super Bowl LV, Budweiser plans to run its Super Bowl ad digitally. The spot focuses on resilient Americans during the coronavirus pandemic, including a group of health-care workers who were the first to receive the vaccine. Actress Rashida Jones, known for her roles in ""The Office"" and ""Parks and Recreation,"" will narrate the spot.

The beer brand also plans to donate a percentage of its advertising airtime for 2021 to the Ad Council and Covid Collaborative's Vaccine Education Initiative. Budweiser will support its efforts with additional campaigns throughout the year.

Alice Sylvester, the co-founder of Sequent Partners, a marketing measurement analytics consultancy, said that Budweiser is taking purpose-driven marketing to the next level and differentiating itself from Super Bowl advertisers whose commercials will air during the game.

""It speaks to the long tail impact of Super Bowl advertising, which is as much about brand building than it is about short term revenue generation,"" Sylvester said.

The company also isn't entirely giving up promoting its beer. Budweiser is giving U.S. consumers who are at least 21 years old a free beer when they visit ABeerOnBud.com between Jan. 25 and Feb. 7. AB InBev's other brands, including Michelob Ultra, Bud Light and Bud Light Seltzer Lemonade, will have in-game ads during the Super Bowl.

Budweiser isn't the only iconic brand sitting out the game. PepsiCo and Coca-Cola have said they won't be running in-game ads for their namesake sodas. Pepsi is instead focusing on its sponsorship of the halftime show, which stars The Weeknd. PepsiCo's other brands, including Mtn Dew and Frito-Lay, are planning on airing commercials during the game.

In a statement to CNBC, Coke said it has chosen to focus on ""investing in the right resources."" The pandemic has upended the beverage giant's business because fewer drinks are being consumed away from home. Its revenue fell 13% during the first nine months of 2020.

Last year's Super Bowl drew about 100 million viewers, but attracting those eyeballs comes with a hefty price tag for advertisers. A 30-second commercial during the football game will set companies back about $5.5 million this year, slightly less than 2020's rate of $5.6 million.

Shares of Budweiser parent AB InBev have fallen 14.5% in the last year, giving the company a market value of about $113 billion. While at-home consumption of beer is up due to the pandemic, the blow to bars and sports stadiums has resulted in a 6.8% revenue decline during the first nine months of 2020.",https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/25/super-bowl-budweiser-to-sit-out-the-big-game-fund-covid-vaccine-ads.html
Tesla’s Elon Musk donates $5 million to free education platform Khan Academy,Elon Musk donates $5 million to free education platform Khan Academy,1.0,"By

Elon Musk, through the The Musk Foundation, has donated $5 million to American non-profit educational organization Khan Academy, which seeks to help students and teachers across the globe by providing access to free, world-class education. The donation was shared by Khan Academy founder, Salman Khan, who thanked the CEO in a YouTube video.

In his message, Khan noted that The Musk Foundation‘s $5 million donation would go a long way towards accelerating the academy’s projects. With about 20 to 30 million students using the Khan Academy’s platform every month, after all, Musk’s $5 million donation can provide a notable boost to the non-profit’s programs.

Thank you @elonmusk and @MuskFoundation for an incredible $5m donation to @khanacademy. Here is my thank you video:https://t.co/1LyABVmTyt — Salman Khan (@salkhanacademy) January 12, 2021

“Elon, I hope you really feel good about this. This is going to allow us to accelerate all sorts of content. Our aspirations are all subjects from K through the early stages of college. This will accelerate our science content, allow us to do more on early learning, allow us to make the software and practice that much more engaging for millions of students around the world, for teachers around the world,” Khan said.

Inasmuch as Elon Musk’s $5 million donation will go a long way, Khan noted that the academy still needs far more resources in the near future. The founder noted that the online academy is operating at a budget that’s about comparable to that of a large school, but it has aspirations to cater to students across the globe. With this in mind, Musk’s donation could hopefully accelerate some support for the initiative, which has touched so many lives across the globe.

Khan Academy aims to provide a free, personalized learning experience to every student, mainly built on videos that are hosted through YouTube. The academy’s website supports the videos, offering students and teachers features such as progress tracking, practice exercises, and teaching tools. Mobile app support is also available.

At the age of just 13, Nadia Sparkes, otherwise known as 'Trash Girl', already has enough achievements under her belt to make the average adult envious.

Over the past few years, Nadia's commitment to litter picking on her cycle to school has made headlines.

Last January we ran a story about her achievements and how children at her local school had bullied her, naming her 'Trash Girl', a title she has since proudly owned.

After the article went viral, the bullying eased off for a few months but then escalated again.

Unfortunately, she felt her school did not support her and she says she was disappointed when the headteacher suggested she give up litter picking to ease off the bullies.

Despite this, Nadia continued to litter pick and has now gained a large following on Instagram and Facebook, with supporters worldwide.

Last year Nadia was honoured as part of our Stars of Norfolk and Waveney Awards, withher prize being that she spent time in the newsroom showing us the importance of recycling and what things to look out for on a litter pick.

During a short trip around Norwich city centre we collected a full tote bag worth of cans, sandwich boxes and bottles.

Alcohol cans seemed to be a main offender in the city centre, with many bottles next to a bin.

Most people do not realise that what is dropped will go down a drain, end up in the river and then wind up on the beaches.

The closer you look the worse it gets.

Nadia, from Hellesdon, has now left her old school and is about to start at Reepham High School, which is renowned for being very eco conscious.

Nadia said she was 'very excited about the move' and looked forward to being part of the school and spreading her message.

"JetBlue, American, Delta cap ticket prices out of Florida ahead of Hurricane Irma",JetBlue caps direct flight ticket prices out of Florida at $99 ahead of Hurricane Irma,1.0,"REUTERS/Mike Blake

JetBlue (JBLU) is capping its ticket prices in every city in Florida where the airline operates so people can evacuate as Hurricane Irma barrels through the Caribbean.

JetBlue will charge a maximum of $99 up to the last available seat for direct flights and a maximum of $159 up to the last available seat for connecting flights, a JetBlue representative told Yahoo Finance. That includes government taxes.

The airline has also added flights to its schedule out of select cities where they have aircraft available.

For existing reservations, JetBlue is waiving cancellation fees as well as waiving change fees and differences in air fare for rebooking.

“Given that many Floridians are struggling to get out of harm’s way, this is welcome news,” Florida Sen. Bill Nelson (D-FL) said in an emailed statement sent by a spokesman. “I hope more airlines do the right thing and follow suit.”

Other airlines followed JetBlue’s lead.

On Wednesday afternoon, American Airlines (AAL) said it would also cap its airfares.

“While there are limited seats remaining before the storm hits, we will cap our pre-tax fares at $99 for MainCabin seats on direct, single leg flights out of Florida for tickets sold through Sunday Sept. 10 for travel until Sept. 13,” a spokeswoman said in a statement to Yahoo Finance.

A spokesman for Delta (DAL) told Yahoo Finance that the airline reduced the price level of its highest fares, which are “typically seen when customers are booking last-minute travel and inventory is limited.”

“In addition, we are waiving change fees for customers who want to change their flight plans due to the forecast. We have full details on the waiver at delta.com,” the Delta spokesman said. “We also are adding flights and increasing the size of the aircraft we’re using on flights to and from San Juan and south Florida, providing more opportunities for customers to leave. New flights are being added to and from San Juan, Miami, Palm Beach, Fort Lauderdale and Key West, all to Atlanta (where people can connect to destinations across the U.S.).”

Story continues

Delta is capping fares at $399 on flights out of Florida and the impacted islands. New flights are being added from Miami, Palm Beach, Fort Lauderdale and Key West to Atlanta, the spokesman confirmed to Yahoo Finance.

United Airlines (UAL) added six additional flights in Florida with airfare capped at $399. Those additional flights have already sold out, according to a spokesperson.

A number of travelers had complained of steep airfares as they scrambled to book tickets to flee the storm. Some had even noticed prices above $1,000.

Here’s what the fares look like on JetBlue’s website at the time of this article’s publication.

A mysterious grey-hat is patching people's outdated MikroTik routers,A hacker is breaking into people's routers and patching them so they can't be abused by other hackers.,1.0,"Botnet beast: How to slay the DDoS dragon Watch Now

A Russian-speaking grey-hat hacker is breaking into people's MikroTik routers and patching devices so they can't be abused by cryptojackers, botnet herders, or other cyber-criminals, ZDNet has learned.

The hacker, who goes by the name of Alexey and says he works as a server administrator, claims to have disinfected over 100,000 MikroTik routers already.

Alexey has not been trying to hide his actions and has boasted about his hobby on a Russian blogging platform. He says he accesses routers and makes changes to their settings to prevent further abuse.

Also: Best VPN services of 2020: Safe and fast don't come for free

""I added firewall rules that blocked access to the router from outside the local network,"" Alexey said. ""In the comments, I wrote information about the vulnerability and left the address of the @router_os Telegram channel, where it was possible for them to ask questions.""

But despite adjusting firewall settings for over 100,000 users, Alexey says that only 50 users reached out via Telegram. A few said ""thanks,"" but most were outraged.

The vigilante server administrator says he's been only fixing routers that have not been patched by their owners against a MikroTik vulnerability that came to light in late April.

At the time, the vulnerability (known as CVE-2018-14847) was a zero-day, but MikroTik rolled out a fix in record time. Nonetheless, cyber-criminals quickly jumped on board to exploit the flaw.

CVE-2018-14847 is a very convenient vulnerability because it allows an attacker to bypass authentication and download the user database file. Attackers decrypt this file and then use one of the username & password combos to log into a remote device and make OS settings and run various scripts.

For the past five and a half months, the vulnerability has been mainly used to plant cryptojacking scripts on outdated MikroTik routers [1, 2] and to hijack DNS servers and later redirect user traffic towards malicious sites [1, 2].

This wouldn't be an issue, but MikroTik is one of today's most popular router brand. There are over two million MikroTik routers around the globe.

Security researcher Troy Mursch told ZDNet today that of the millions of MikroTik routers currently connected to the Internet, over 420,000 show signs they've been infected with cryptocurrency-mining scripts.

Speaking to ZDNet today, Ankit Anubhav, a security researcher for NewSky Security, has also indicated that DDoS botnet authors have also been trying to infect and corral these devices under their control, but failing.

""The usual IoT blackhat botnet factory is basically clueless about the exploit, and how it can be deployed for a proper functioning botnet,"" Anubhav said.

Instead, he says the people placing cryptocurrency-mining scripts on the devices are far more adept at hijacking the vulnerable routers. Anubhav speculated that this looks to be the ""work of a knowledgeable lone actor.""

Things became even worse for the MikroTik community this past week after Tenable researchers released a new exploit named ""By The Way"" for the original CVE-2018-14847 vulnerability. This spurred new interest from the botnet community.

But the reason why Alexey was able to ""clean"" over 100,000 routers is because none of the hacker groups currently abusing MikroTik routers appear to perform basic hygiene.

""The attackers are not closing [device ports] or patching the devices, so anyone who wants to further mess with these routers, can,"" Anubhav told ZDNet.

Fortunately, Alexey has been doing this clean-up on some users's behalf. But technically speaking, Alexey is on the wrong side of the law. Despite his good intentions, it is illegal to access another person or organization's equipment without consent.

Alexey's vigilante spree may be illegal, but he is definitely not the first.

In 2014, a hacker accessed thousands of ASUS routers and planted text warnings inside computers with shared folders and hard drives that were located behind those routers, warning users to patch their ASUS device.

In late 2015, a team of vigilante hackers going by the name of the White Team launched the Linux.Wifatch malware that closed security holes on a variety of Linux-based routers. At one point, the White Team's botnet became so big it battled with the botnet of the infamous Lizard Squad team for the title of the Internet's largest botnet.

In 2017, a more devious vigilante hacker named The Janit0r deployed the BrickerBot malware that erased firmware or bricked IoT devices that had not been updated.

Also in 2017, a hacker made over 150,000 printers spew out a message to their owners to raise everyone's awareness about the danger of leaving printers exposed online.

In 2018, another vigilante renamed tens of thousands of MikroTik and Ubiquiti routers to ""HACKED"" and other messages to get owners' attention to update their devices.

Mursch told ZDNet that he doesn't believe the MikroTik situation will get better any time soon.

""Rebooting grandma's router won't fix this,"" he said. ""Remediation efforts must be done by the service providers.""

The reason is that many of these devices are not routers placed inside users' homes, but are so-called ""edge"" devices, often part of an ISP's internal infrastructure, such as routers placed in ISP boxes left inside apartment complexes or on street poles.

Another source in the infosec community who spoke to ZDNet but did not want his name shared for this story confirmed that Alexey's vigilante efforts have also touched edge routers, not only those found in people's homes.

""Ironically, by cleaning some ISP routers he might get the ISPs to act and fix everyone's routers as well,"" the unnamed researcher told us.

As for MikroTik, the Latvian company has been one of the most responsive vendors in terms of security flaws, fixing issues within hours or days, compared to the months that some other router vendors tend to take. It would be unfair to blame this situation on them. Patches have been available for months, but, yet again, it is ISPs and home users who are failing to take advantage of them.

"Colorado governor to mass-pardon 2,700-plus marijuana convictions","Colorado governor to mass-pardon 2,700-plus marijuana convictions",1.0,"Colorado Gov. Jared Polis plans to mass-pardon 2,732 convictions of low-level marijuana possession through an executive order Thursday after signing a bill earlier this year that gave him that authority.

“This really catches Coloradans up with where the law is today,” he told The Denver Post.

House Bill 1424, passed by the General Assembly earlier this year, included a provision that allows the governor to pardon those who have convictions on their criminal records for possessing up to 2 ounces of marijuana — the current legal limit for medical marijuana users.

Polis’ pardon, however, will only apply to convictions in state courts through 2012 of up to 1 ounce for recreational use, consistent with Colorado Amendment 64, passed by voters in 2012.

It will not apply to convictions in municipal courts or in other states.

The governor said his office worked with the Colorado Bureau of Investigation to sort through criminal histories and determine the exact number of eligible convictions. The total number of individuals who will benefit from the pardon was not immediately available because a single person could have been convicted on more than one charge.

Unlike programs in Denver and Boulder to expunge marijuana convictions, those eligible for the pardon will not have to apply. In the first six months of Denver’s program, fewer than 1% of the 13,000 people eligible successfully got their convictions erased.

Other states have taken action to address previous low-level convictions after marijuana legalization. Nevada, for instance, automatically pardoned more than 15,000, and California has adopted an automatic expungement process for certain marijuana convictions.

Minor marijuana offenses could stand in the way of people obtaining jobs, student loans or concealed-carry permits, Polis said.

“In addition to being symbolic, (the pardon) has real-life ramifications for people,” he said.

Anyone who wants to check if Polis’ pardon will apply to them can go to comarijuanapardons.com.

The pardon won’t expunge or seal records related to the convictions, according to the governor’s office. But the convictions will be removed from individuals’ public records, so if a member of the public runs a background check, a conviction won’t show up. It would still appear in law enforcement background checks but with a note about the governor’s pardon.

That’s the next goal for Rep. James Coleman, a Denver Democrat and one of the sponsors of House Bill 1424.

“Whether it’s one or a thousand (people), my focus is to figure out by the time I’m done in the legislature how we not only pardon these individuals but figure out how to expunge it off their records,” Coleman said.

He plans to look at more policies in the 2021 legislative session to address equity and opportunities for people to work in the cannabis industry.",https://www.denverpost.com/2020/10/01/colorado-marijuana-convictions-pardons-governor-polis/
High School Student Nicknamed ‘Trash Girl’ by Bullies Refuses to Stop Collecting Litter,High School Student Nicknamed ‘Trash Girl’ by Bullies Refuses to Stop Collecting Litter,1.0,"Many people may not want to think about our plastic pollution problem, but it’s imperative that we do. Every year, we produce 300 million tons of plastic and around 8.8 million tons of it get dumped in the oceans, threatening countless animals, many of which are on the verge of extinction as a result. If that wasn’t bad enough, it’s now estimated that by 2050, there will be more plastic in the ocean than fish.

As one of the greatest threats to our oceans and the animals that we share the planet with, we need to rethink every single aspect of how much waste we produce and how we deal with it. That’s why 12-year-old Nadia Sparkes decided to take matters into her own hands. The high schooler has been picking up trash along the two-mile route from her school to her home for months now, using the basket of her bike to bring the trash home. In just the short amount of time that she has been picking up trash, Nadia has already accumulated more than two recycling bins worth of plastic.

Despite her green intentions, some of the kids at Nadia’s school have dubbed her “Trash Girl” and have bullied her for her noble efforts to help the planet. It would be easy to succumb to mean comments and stop picking up trash, but on the contrary, Nadia is more determined than ever to clean up her community.

“I’m doing something to protect the world they also live in. It’s everyone’s job. We are all responsible for keeping this world safe, instead of believing that it’s always someone else’s job,” Nadia said about the bullies.

“I told her she had two choices, she could either stop collecting rubbish, stop drawing their attention and hopefully they would leave her alone. Or she could own “trash girl,” Paula Sparkes, Nadia’s mom, said about the bullies.

As a result of the media attention Nadia has received, she now has created a Facebook group aptly named “Team Trash Girl” where she shares updates on her efforts. Positive comments have poured in, all in support of Nadia, advocating for her to ignore the negative. “Nadia, I think you’re truly awesome! Own that nickname and don’t give up. The bullies are ignorant and should be ashamed. I wish more people were just like you,” Emma Whitmore said.

Local artists have also shown their support by creating original artwork that boldly says “Team Trash Girl.”

If you’d like to stay up to date on Nadia’s work to rid her community of trash, you can join the “Team Trash Girl” Facebook group. At a time when our plastic pollution has become a full-blown environmental crisis, Nadia’s efforts are important now more than ever. We need more people like Nadia to proudly stand up for what they believe in!

What You Can Do!

A staggering 1 trillion plastic bags are used each year worldwide, according to the Earth Policy Institute. Plastic bags are made out of non-renewable resources like petroleum and natural gas, and because they take hundreds of years to decompose, when plastics do eventually degrade, they don’t biodegrade. Instead, they photodegrade, which means they break down into smaller fragments and easily soak up toxins, which then contaminate waterways, soil, and animals upon digestion of the plastic materials.

If we all make an effort to identify where we use plastic and actively look for alternatives, we can drastically cut down on the amount of plastic pollution that finds its way into the oceans. Achieving a 100 percent waste-free lifestyle is challenging, but it is certainly not impossible. Just take a look at Lauren Singer, the 25-year-old who can store all the waste she’s produced in the past few years in just a single mason jar!

As the leading organization at the forefront of the conscious consumerism movement, One Green Planet believes that reducing everyday plastics from our lives is not about giving up anything or sacrificing convenience, but rather learning to reap the maximum benefits from the items you use every day while having minimal impact.

Finland to offer new fathers as much paid leave as mothers,Finland to offer new fathers as much paid leave as mothers,1.0,"HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finland’s woman-led centre-left government plans to give new fathers the same amount of paid time off work as new mothers, nearly doubling paternity leave, it announced on Wednesday.

Finland's Minister of Social Affairs and Health Aino-Kaisa Pekonen holds a news conference on the family leave reform in Helsinki, Finland February 5, 2020. Lehtikuva/Vesa Moilanen via REUTERS

Paid paternity leave will be extended to nearly seven months, in line with maternity leave. Around half can be given to the other parent. Pregnant women are also entitled to a month of pregnancy leave before the expected date of birth.

Minister of Health and Social Affairs Aino-Kaisa Pekonen said the aim of the “radical reform” was both to improve gender equality and to boost a declining birth rate.

“This enables better equality between parents and diversity among families,” she said.

The number of newborns in Finland fell by around a fifth between 2010 and 2018, to just 47,577 babies in a country of around 5.5 million people. Pekonen said other countries such as Sweden and Iceland had seen increases in their birth rates after offering more leave for fathers.

Finland’s coalition of five parties, all led by women of whom four are under 35 years old, took office in December and has made gender equality a priority.

Speaking at the 50th annual World Economic Forum meeting in Davos last month, Prime Minister Sanna Marin called for states and companies to do more to ensure women were treated fairly, saying gender equality “doesn’t happen by itself”.

A previous centre-right Finnish government attempted to reform parental leave in 2018 but eventually rejected the idea as too costly.

Pekonen said a more equal distribution of domestic workload between parents has been proven to diminish the risk of divorce.

“Over a longer term, it also improves equality in working life and in wages by directing fathers to use a larger proportion of parental leaves than before,” she said.",https://in.reuters.com/article/finland-politics/finland-to-offer-new-fathers-as-much-paid-leave-as-mothers-idINKBN1ZZ1NK
Rising from the rubble: London pub rebuilt brick by brick after illegal bulldozing,"This London pub was illegally demolished in 2015 by greedy developers who wanted the land. They had hoped to get away with a manageable fine but instead were ordered to rebuild it exactly as it was, brick by brick. It’s due to reopen next month.",1.0,"Standing next to the rubble of the Carlton Tavern, its patrons thought that this was just another brazen example of developers skirting the law to turn their pub into profit.

Bulldozers had sheared away the wall of the 1920s west London pub, with its distinctive tiled signage, to reveal the fully stocked bar and darts trophies still on display.

But the Carlton’s story did not follow the usual plot, where the developer presents the fait accompli to the local authority and pays a fine before pressing ahead with the redevelopment and counting their profits.

Instead, after a dogged six-year campaign by locals, the Carlton Tavern will reopen next month – lockdown permitting – after the developers were ordered to rebuild the pub “brick by brick”, a ruling that pub campaigners say has set an extraordinary precedent.

“People said it was impossible,” said Polly Robertson, a leading member of the Rebuild the Carlton Tavern campaign. “Many people said, ‘Polly, it’s not worth it, nothing’s going to happen’. And I just thought, no – I’m not going to let it lie.”

The reopening comes on 12 April, the day that Covid-19 restrictions are due to be lifted in England to let pubs and restaurants serve drinks and meals outdoors. It is a day that will be celebrated by England’s 33,305 pubs, but by none more keenly than at the Carlton in Maida Vale.

The Carlton Tavern’s last orders were in April 2015. After being denied planning permission to convert it into 10 flats, and two days before Historic England was due to recommend the pub be granted Grade-II listed status, the owners ordered its demolition.

Robertson and 5,300 other locals, including several local councillors, mobilised to persuade Westminster council to act.

It ordered the owners, CTLX, to rebuild the Carlton brick by brick. A planning inquiry the following year confirmed the decision, ruling that the pub should be rebuilt “in facsimile”, from the red bricks to the distinctive tiled pub name.

“They said it would be too difficult to do, but we had an answer for that,” Robertson said. “We had a suspicion before the demolition that they would do something, so we asked Historic England to think about listing it. They took a plaster cast of every tile, they took pictures and documented everything.”

With nowhere left to turn, the developers started the rebuild. “And to be fair to [CTLX], they have done amazing work,” Robertson said. “It looks fantastic.”

Although praise for the demolishers goes only so far. “I doubt they will be [at the reopening]. The community would eat them alive,” she said.

The Carlton Tavern’s wooden doors, fittings and tiled signs are remarkably similar to photographs taken before 2015. The new leaseholders are Tom Rees and Ben Martin, who set up Homegrown Pubs last year, and they are still putting the finishing touches to the fit-out.

“Lots of parts of the bar and the fireplace, the bannister, have been reclaimed from the rubble,” Rees said. “The pub tells its story from the half-broken fixtures that we’ve got. You can see bits of broken wood – it’s not all perfect, which we really love because it gives character and charm to the building.”

Rees and Martin have restored the cellar, which will be stocked by local London brewers including the Camden Town Brewery, Five Points from Hackney, the London Brewing Co, and Anspach & Hobday.

“Ben and I have been running pubs and restaurants for a long time, and we decided to set up our company,” Rees said. “I live locally and I knew about the pub. This has happened multiple times in different places and there’s never been a result like this.

“From the outside, it seems like a totally mad thing to do – setting up a pub company during the middle of the pandemic. But, from the inside, landlords have had the upper hand with leaseholders for ever, so this was an opportunity to level the playing field across the industry.”

The new Carlton will focus more on food, although Rees fights shy of the word “gastropub”.

“We want it to be a great little boozer where you can come and have some pints of cask any day of the week, but we’ll also have a nice dining area out the back. We hope we can be everything to everyone.”

James Watson, the pub protection adviser for the Campaign for Pubs, advised the Carlton campaign. “I never imagined that I would see a planning inspector order a developer to put back what he’d just knocked down, to look exactly as it was. I thought the developer would get a slap on the wrist, a £6,000 fine. But I was flabbergasted – and it has set an incredibly useful precedent. Other planning inspectors will remember it, and so will developers.”

Watson was involved in campaigning for legislation in 2017 that went some way to stopping pubs from being converted into shops under permitted development rules – full planning permission is now required.

“Most developers tend to be slightly smarter than sending in the bulldozers,” he said. “The age-old trick is to take some tiles off the roof and let the rain in. The beams rot, it collapses and they say to the council, ‘This is a derelict site that needs to be rebuilt as flats.’”

Councils in Cambridge and London are questioning this method more and more, Watson said. “They’re challenging these Trojan horse attacks on pubs, where they say they’re going to put a bike shed in the basement and a gym upstairs and, suddenly, your pub space is just a lock-up.

“We need other councils around the country to do the same,” he said. “Planning officers need to be wise to these tricks.”",https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2021/mar/21/rising-from-the-rubble-london-pub-rebuilt-brick-by-brick-after-bulldozing
Aldi introduces wages higher than the ‘real living wage’ after supermarket has record year,Aldi introduces wages higher than the ‘real living wage’ after supermarket has record year,1.0,"Aldi has increased its hourly rates of pay for staff after breaking the £12bn sales barrier for the first time.

Last year Aldi reported record earnings in the UK and Ireland against a increasingly fragile retail sector. It also enjoyed a strong Christmas.

The German discounter has again touted itself as the UK’s best-paying supermarket after it increased wages for all employees.

The company said all store assistants will from February earn £9.10 per hour outside the M25, and £10.55 in London. Interestingly, Aldi said all workers are paid the same flat rate, however old they are.

Employees previously earned £8.85 per hour and £10.20 per hour respectively.

Real living wage

Regionally, Aldi’s pay exceeds the UK’s “real living wage”, which is encouraged by the Living Wage Foundation and is more than the Government’s statutory boundaries. Many feel the Government’s rates are too low.

In London, the supermarket’s new £10.55 wage matches the charity’s voluntary minimum. Aldi also told i that store managers start on £44,890, which is almost £20,000 more than a junior doctor’s starting salary, and more than double that of a police officer beginning their career.

While Aldi’s rates of pay are notable, it’s worth pointing out that the company employs fewer members of staff per store than traditional supermarkets like Sainsbury’s and Waitrose. Aldi has around 40 members of staff in each shop, while rivals require far more – usually more than double.

The budget chain is able to make do with fewer workers thanks to its more efficient operating system – shelves don’t need stacking because food products are put up still in boxes, for example, and checkouts run quicker as customers bag their own groceries. There are numerous other cost-saving mechanisms.

Tesco launched its discount spin-off Jack’s based on a similar model touting speed and simplicity. Jack’s also functions with fewer team members than classic Tesco branches. Staff pay at Jack’s is £9 per hour – 10p less than Aldi.

New store plans

Aldi’s pay rise comes as high street stores continue to struggle. At Waitrose, staff – or “partners” as they are known – are given a yearly bonus in addition to their wages, but this year they may not get one for the first time since 1953.



Giles Hurley, CEO for Aldi UK, said: “Our store colleagues do a fantastic job every day and the excellent service they provide to customers is a key reason why we are the UK’s fastest-growing supermarket.

“We’re committed to being the best supermarket employer in Britain and this means rewarding our colleagues for the excellent job they do with market-leading rates of pay and opportunities to progress their career at Aldi.”

Aldi now has more than 800 stores across the UK and plans to open a further 65 in 2019. The company said it will be creating around 2,500 new jobs in the process.

The German chain wants to have 1,200 branches in the UK by the end of 2025. Morrisons and co. must be worried.",https://inews.co.uk/news/consumer/aldi-wages-higher-living-wage-profit-increase-results/
DEA finally ends fed monopoly on schwaggy research-grade cannabis,"Good news! The DEA quietly announced ending their monopoly on cannabis grown for scientific purposes. And that means American researchers can, for the first time ever, conduct studies using real-world cannabis instead of the terrible low-THC they’ve been forced to use for decades....",1.0,"Politics DEA finally ends fed monopoly on schwaggy research-grade cannabis Bruce Kennedy May 18, 2021 For decades, American researchers have been forced to use only poor-quality, low-THC cannabis grown by a Mississippi contractor. Now the DEA is allowing others, who know how to grow good cannabis, to supply research-grade weed to scientists. (AdobeStock)

Late last week, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) quietly made an announcement that’s expected to have a profound and long-lasting impact on cannabis research and development in the United States.

In its statement, the DEA said it was “nearing the end of its review of certain marijuana grower applications, thereby allowing it to soon register additional entities authorized to produce marijuana for research purposes.”

In other words, the feds are ending their monopoly on cannabis grown for scientific purposes. And that means American researchers can, for the first time ever, conduct studies using real-world cannabis instead of the terrible low-THC schwag they’ve been forced to use for decades.

NIDA monopoly since 1968

There are several reasons why this is a big deal. Since 1968, the only federally approved supplier of cannabis for research purposes in the United States has been a 12-acre farm run by the National Center for the Development of Natural Products at the University of Mississippi. That production has been exclusively for the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), which maintains control over the production and distribution of research-grade cannabis in the United States.

Over the years, the Mississippi weed farm has earned a notorious reputation for growing some of the worst cannabis in the world. Leafly’s Ben Adlin documented the shockingly poor quality in this 2017 article:

Smoking 25% THC, studying 8% THC

The poor quality and low potency of the government-grown cannabis has been an ongoing issue for U.S. cannabis researchers.

The inadequacy of NIDA cannabis has led to some high-profile academic disputes, lawsuits and national headlines, as well as well-founded accusations that the DEA was dragging its feet on the issue. In 2017 Rick Doblin, founder and executive director of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) declared that NIDA was “completely inadequate as a source of marijuana for drug development research.”

For years, NIDA and the DEA have promised to open up the sourcing of federally-approved research cannabis. But nothing happened.

Related Wasn’t the DEA going to let others grow research-grade cannabis?

DEA finally relents

On May 14, however, the DEA announced that “a number of manufacturers’ applications to cultivate marijuana for research needs in the United States appears to be consistent with applicable legal standards and relevant laws.”

As a result, and pending final approval, the agency has given preliminary approval to several organizations to grow cannabis for research.

At the moment only three organizations have been publicly named as approved new growers for research: Pennsylvania-based Groff North America, the Scottsdale Research Institute (SRI) in Arizona, and Biopharmaceutical Research Company (BRC) in California.

‘Monumental step’

For George Hodgin, a former Navy SEAL who is the founder and CEO of BRC, the DEA’s announcement is nothing but good news.

“Up until now, research institutions, biotech firms and other private companies had few, if any, options for federally legal cannabis R&D,” he said in an email to Leafly. “This monumental step from the DEA means that BRC can now position itself as that all-in-one source for reliable and safe research and cultivation.”

Hodgin noted that companies like his also want research organizations to have more choices in the marketplace; ensuring that “the quality of the product is comparable to the supply used by cannabis patients as well as recreational users.”

The DEA announcement, he added, will “unleash a new wave of job creation in the cannabis sector and at the same time begin to develop valuable American IP [intellectual property]. This just wasn’t really possible before this decision.”

Real-world cannabis finally available

For Matthew Zorn, a Houston-based attorney, the DEA’s decision is historic. Zorn was the co-lead lawyer in a Freedom of Information (FOIA) lawsuit, “Scottsdale Research v. DOJ/DEA,” filed last year. As a result of that lawsuit, filed on behalf of SRI, the Department of Justice released a previously confidential memo from 2018 that concluded the DEA’s long-standing policy on marijuana research violated federal law, as well as U.S. treaty obligations.

SRI has made cannabis research headlines for years now, most recently for groundbreaking studies administered by Sue Sisley, a medical doctor who conducted clinic trials with military veterans to determine if cannabis is a safe and well-tolerated treatment for managing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and pain.

With the DEA announcement, Zorn told Leafly, “scientists will be able to clinically study the types of cannabis that are being used, with real-world cannabis. A lot of people may not appreciate the importance of that, with [national cannabis] legalization around the corner. We don’t know when, but the need for this research is urgent. We can as quickly as possible start growing and have a supply for researchers to get good data.”

Breaking down barriers to research

The promise to end NIDA’s cannabis monopoly, Zorn noted, is the first step towards addressing the longstanding argument by cannabis legalization opponents, that there’s no rigorous data in the U.S. that has shown the medicinal benefits of cannabis.

“Everything’s been limited to observational studies,” he said, “and it’s true clinical studies have taken place overseas. But the biggest criticism right now against medicinal marijuana and marijuana legalization more generally is that there isn’t enough data and research. That is directly traceable to this NIDA monopoly. And now, hopefully, we’re going to get answers.”

Fueling innovation in the cannabis sector

For his part BRC’s George Hodgin sees the start of a new era of cannabis research and development, fueled in part by a new players in the marketplace.

“Now there’s competition, which this space has needed so badly for such a long time,” he said. “We’re ready to compete, that’s what we’ve been waiting for years to do. The decision to issue these licenses, in my view, will lead to an incredible rush of innovation in the healthcare space.”

But according to Hodgin, these developments will depend on more than rapid change. “Quality is just as important,” he said. “You can have the best research institutions in the world researching cannabis, but if the quality of the samples does not match what is actually in use, the research isn’t all that helpful. So, I think the competition will increase the speed, there’s not a doubt about that, but I also think the quality is going to be a crucial part of driving the innovation as well.”

Farmer spends 16 years studying law by himself to sue firm,Farmer spends 16 years studying law by himself so he could sue a powerful chemical firm for 'polluting his land' - and he wins the first round,1.0,"Wang Enlin, who has just three years of education, has won the first instance of a high-profile case in China

A Chinese farmer has spent 16 years studying law by himself so he could sue a chemical company for allegedly polluting his land.

Wang Enlin, who had just three years of education, has won the first instance in a high-profile case against state-owned Qihua Group, reported the People's Daily Online.

Although Qihua Group, whose assets exceed two billion yuan (£233 million), has appealed against the decision, the elderly man said he is determined to seek justice for himself and his neighbours who could no longer grow healthy crops on their contaminated land.

Mr Wang, who is in his 60s, lives in the Yushutun village on the outskirts of Qiqihar in the Heilongjiang Province, according to People's Daily Online, which cited China Youth Daily.

The man said he would forever remember the year of 2001 when his land was flooded by the toxic waste discharged by Qihua Group.

It was the eve of the Lunar New Year, and Mr Wang was playing cards and making dumplings with his neighbours. All of sudden, they realised that the house they were in was flooded by the wastewater from the nearby Qihua factory.

The wastewater also flooded part of the farmland in the village.

According to the report, a government document from 2001 claimed that the affected farmland 'can not be used for a long time' due to the pollution.

Between 2001 to 2016, it has been suggested that Qihua continued to dump hazardous waste into the village, whose residents rely upon agriculture for a living.

The company produced polyvinyl chloride and released 15,000 to 20,000 tons of chemical waste every year, the report said.

Qihua has also reportedly created a 71-acre wasteland with calcium carbide residue and a 478-acre pond with its liquid waste.

A picture released by People's Daily Online shows that the Qihua Group has dumped 71 acres of calcium carbide residue in the village of Yushutun, where Mr Wang lives

In 2001, Mr Wang wrote a letter to the Land Resources Bureau of Qiqihar to complain about the pollution Qihua had brought to his village.

He said while dealing with the local officials, he was repeatedly asked to produce evidence to prove that the village's land had been polluted.

Mr Wang told a reporter: 'I knew I was in the right, but I did not know what law the other party had broken or whether or not there was evidence.' He received the interview in his small home which he spent 50 yuan (£5.8) per month renting from the village's authority.

As a result, Mr Wang decided to study law by himself, an endeavour he would carry on pursuing for the next 16 years.

The farmer, who had dropped out of primary school at the third grade, started reading through a dozen law books with the help of a dictionary.

At the time, he did not have money to buy the books, so he spent day after day reading the books at the local book store and copying the relevant information by hand, according to the man. In return, he would give bags of free corn to the shopkeeper for letting him stay there.

Not only that, he also used the legal knowledge he had learnt to help his neighbours gather evidence. Their farms had also been polluted by Qihua Group, said Mr Wang.

In 2007, a Chinese law firm specialised in handling pollution-related cases started providing free legal advice to Mr Wang and his neighbours. They also agreed to help the villagers file petition to the court.

However due to unspecified complications, the court only began processing Mr Wang and his neighbours' case in 2015 - eight years after the original petition had been made, People's Daily Online reported.

Thanks to the evidence Mr Wang had gathered in the 16 years, Mr Wang and his neighbours apparently won the first instance.

The Angangxi District Court of Qiqihar ruled that the families in Yushutun village would receive financial compensation from Qihua Group amounting 820,000 yuan (£96,000). The date of the first instance was not revealed in the report.

Qihua Group has appealed against the court's decision. The case is being processed at the Angangxi District Court as of writing.

A determined Mr Wang told the reporter: 'We will certainly win. Even if we lose, we will continue to battle.'",http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/peoplesdaily/article-4189350/Farmer-spends-16-years-studying-law-sue-firm.html
Britney Spears officially petitions for dad Jamie Spears to resign as her conservator,Britney Spears officially petitions for dad Jamie Spears to resign as her conservator,1.0,"Britney Spears, said by her lawyers to be chafing under the 12-year guardianship of her father, has filed an official petition seeking to have him removed as her conservator.

According to documents filed Tuesday in probate court in Los Angeles, the pop star requested the resignation of James ""Jamie"" Spears as her personal conservator.

She seeks to replace him with Jodi Montgomery, a state-appointed conservator who has temporarily acted as her personal conservator since her father relinquished the role in September 2019 amid health issues.

Britney Spears also reserved the right to petition for the permanent termination of her conservatorship under the state Probate Code.

In an attachment, her lawyer sought to ensure that Montgomery would have the power to make medical decisions, communicate with her doctors and have access to her medical records. She also would be able to limit Britney's visitors with the exception of her lawyer, retain caretakers and security guards on a 24/7 basis, and prosecute civil harassment restraining orders deemed appropriate.

The petition does not make clear whether Britney Spears intends for Jamie Spears to retain his other role as conservator of her finances. His lawyers have argued to the probate court hearing the case that he has greatly improved her financial estate, now worth around $60 million.

But a separate document in the court file shows that Jamie Spears and Bessemer Trust, his co-conservator of her finances, will have the power to access all documents and records relating to her assets, and to take actions necessary to secure them, in addition to a host of other powers typically wielded by financial managers.

The petition to remove Jamie Spears may be a direct result of what his lawyer, Vivian Thoreen, said publicly last month in response to criticism on social media and in a new documentary about his daughter's long conservatorship.

She said fans who accuse Jamie Spears of mistreating his daughter have it ""so wrong.""

""(Jamie) would love nothing more than to see Britney not need a conservatorship,"" Thoreen told CNN on Feb. 25. ""Whether or not there is an end to the conservatorship really depends on Britney. If she wants to end her conservatorship, she can file a petition to end it.""

After public sentiment began building for the #FreeBritney movement, and attacks on Jamie Spears mounted, Thoreen tried to advocate on behalf of her client.

""Jamie is not suggesting that he is the perfect dad or that he would receive any 'Father of the Year' award. Like any parent, he doesn't always see eye-to-eye on what Britney may want,"" she told CNN. ""But Jamie believes every single decision he has made has been in her best interest.""

USA TODAY has reached out to Thoreen for comment. Britney's lawyer, Samuel Ingham, declined comment.

Britney Spears, 39, has been under a state conservatorship, as guardianship is called in California, since the end of 2008, following a mental-health breakdown. Her father, 68, has been either a co-conservator or sole conservator during most of the period she has been under supervision of the probate court.

Until recently, she continued her climb as a pop superstar, becoming a multimillionaire with a string of platinum-selling records, taking a gig as a ""X Factor"" judge and becoming the reigning queen of Las Vegas residencies.

By the start of 2019, when she abruptly suspended her Las Vegas show because of her father's health issues, fans began demanding to know why she still needed a guardian looking after her.

In 2020, Britney Spears's lawyers began attempting to get her father removed as her conservator, saying she was ""strongly opposed"" to him remaining in the role.

In November, her lawyer told the court she no longer wanted her father involved in her care, that she is ""afraid"" of him and would refuse to perform if he remained in charge.",https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2021/03/25/britney-spears-petitions-dad-jamie-spears-resign-her-conservator/7004610002/
Golden Dawn guilty verdicts celebrated across Greece,"The Greek Neo-Nazi party, which was in the parliament from ~2012 to ~2019, is now declared a criminal organization",1.0,"A court verdict in Athens with ramifications for the far right across Europe has been met with jubilation in Greece and internationally after judges ruled the neo-fascist Golden Dawn was a criminal organisation in disguise.

Tens of thousands of people who had converged near the heavily guarded court complex in Athens in anticipation of the judgment roared in excitement as the news emerged. Many broke into spontaneous applause and punched the air as it became clear that the three-member tribunal had found the far-right group guilty of operating a gang of hit squads bent on eliminating perceived enemies.

“It’s official. Golden Dawn is over. The conviction is overwhelming,” said Petros Constantinou, a leading anti-racism activist. “The mood here today is resonant of the celebrations we saw with the liberation of Athens from the Nazis. It’s a great day.”

Wrapping up a trial that began in April 2015, the presiding judge, Maria Lepenioti, said the court had concluded that seven of Golden Dawn’s 18 former MPs, including the party founder, Nikolaos Michaloliakos, had led the deadly organisation. The rest were found culpable of participating in the gang.

00:40 Greek court's ruling on Golden Dawn party met with jubilation – video

The verdict was met with widespread relief. Magda Fyssa, whose son Pavlos Fyssas, an anti-fascist rapper, was stabbed to death by a senior party operative, and who attended almost every court session over the past five and half years, screamed with emotion. “Pavlos did it! My son,” she wailed outside the courtroom.

The Greek president, Katerina Sakellaropoulou, said the judgment was an important day for democracy and evidence that Greek institutions were able to “fend off any attempt to undermine them.”

Before the verdict, the public prosecutor overseeing the case recommended the acquittal of many key party members in relation to the criminal organisation charge, citing lack of evidence – a recommendation that was roundly denounced by critics, who accused the magistrate of typifying the toxic influence wielded by conservatives over the justice system.

The hearing was the biggest trial of fascists since the prosecution of the Nazis at Nuremberg after the second world war.

Two thousand police officers, many brought in as backup from the countryside amid fears of violent clashes between the protesters and far-right supporters, surrounded the area near the court as helicopters and drones flew overhead. Clashes did break out as rocks and molotov cocktails were hurled at police, who responded with teargas and water cannon. The violence was attributed to a minority of anti-establishment forces.

The leftist former prime minister Alexis Tsipras, who was in the crowd, said that after years of sowing hate, poisoning Greek society and orchestrating murderous attacks, Golden Dawn fanatics would finally face justice.

“They are not innocent. We all know that,” he wrote on social media before the three-member tribunal’s decision. “On Wednesday we ought to be there to shout it loud and clear. We owe it to the history of this country, we owe it to democracy, we owe it to our children.”

Those charged with directing the criminal organisation face sentences of up to 15 years in prison. If found guilty of additional crimes, the sentences handed down by the criminal court are likely to be longer, although justice officials said it may take several days of legal proceedings before they are formally announced.

The accused vigorously denied the charges, claiming they were victims of political persecution. Michaloliakos, 62, a Holocaust denier and ardent admirer of Hitler whose neofascist beliefs began to take form during Greece’s 1967-74 military dictatorship, has described Golden Dawn as a patriotic party of ultra-nationalists. Diehards lower down the chain who have been linked to violent attacks have been disavowed by the leader.

Golden Dawn stood broadly accused of targeting immigrants, communist trade unionists, anti-fascists, leftists and gay people, culminating in the fatal stabbing of Fyssas, whose murder in September 2013 forced Greek authorities to act. A senior operative in the party, Giorgos Roupakios, confessed to killing the rapper.

Judges sitting in the court of appeals focused on specific cases including whether the group was culpable of the attempted murder of Abouzid Embarak and three other Egyptian fishermen in June 2012.

Golden Dawn members have already been found guilty of the killing of a Pakistani fruit worker, Ssazad Lukman, in Athens in January 2013.

The court examined evidence that ranged from the testimonies of victims and five former Golden Dawn members now in witness protection programmes to incriminating videos snatched from the homes of party leaders, and heard that the attacks increased in frequency after the party’s entry into the Greek parliament in 2012.

At the height of Greece’s debilitating debt crisis, Golden Dawn, riding a tidal wave of popular anger with EU-mandated austerity measures, won 21 seats in the 300-member house to become the country’s third biggest political force.

In the last general election, in July last year, the neo-Nazis narrowly failed to win enough votes to win any seats in parliament, and the party has all but collapsed amid infighting and defections since then.

“The accusations against the leaders and members of Golden Dawn, including the murder of Pavlos Fyssas, expose a fissure that exists not just within Greece but across Europe and beyond,” said Nils Muižnieks, the Europe director of Amnesty. “The impact of this verdict, in what is an emblematic trial of an extreme far-right party with an aggressive anti-migrant and anti-human rights stance, will be felt far beyond Greece’s borders.”

The central Board of Jewish Communities in Greece (Kise) said the “historic verdict ... delegitimises the neo-Nazi organisations and at the same time fortifies democracy in the country”.

But it said this was no time “to let our guard down”. A Jewish cemetery in Athens was vandalised in an attack attributed to the extremists on Monday and its walls daubed with slogans used by the Third Reich.

Pentagon issues de facto ban on Confederate flag at military bases,Pentagon issues de facto ban on Confederate flag at military bases,1.0,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Defense Secretary Mark Esper has issued a policy ushering in a de facto ban on displaying the Confederate flag at U.S. military installations around the world by authorizing only certain flags that promote unity, according to a copy of his memo, seen by Reuters on Friday.

FILE PHOTO: Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley are seen during a House Armed Services Committee hearing on 'Department of Defense Authorities and Roles Related to Civilian Law Enforcement' in Washington, DC, U.S. July 9, 2020.

The decision could increase tension between Esper and Republican President Donald Trump, who has cited free speech rights in his defense of Americans who fly the Confederate flag.

“The flags we fly must accord with the military imperatives of good order and discipline, treating all our people with dignity and respect, and rejecting divisive symbols,” Esper said in the memo.

The Confederate flag was flown by breakaway Southern states that advocated for the continuation of slavery and lost the 1861-65 U.S. Civil War. Flying the flag can be offensive to many Americans, who see it as a reminder of the enslavement of Black Americans and as a symbol of white supremacy.

Supporters say the flag represents the South’s heritage and culture and, along with U.S. military bases named after Confederate generals and statues honoring them, serve as memorials to Confederate casualties in the Civil War.

Trump, who has been accused of intentionally stoking racial tensions as part of his re-election campaign, has criticized the desecration and removal of statues of Confederate and other former U.S. leaders to energize his political base

Trump has also publicly opposed renaming U.S. military bases named after Confederate generals, such as Fort Hood in Texas and Fort Bragg in North Carolina, putting him at odds with his military, whose top general has said the matter should be re-examined.

A defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the White House was aware of Esper’s memo.

Esper also clashed with Trump last month by publicly opposing the deployment of active-duty troops to address civil unrest across the country following the May 25 killing of George Floyd, an African American, by a white police officer in Minneapolis.

Beyond the American flag, Esper’s memorandum cites a series of flags that can be flown on military installations, including state flags and ones to honor prisoners of war and service members who went missing in action.

The reason it does not cite the Confederate flag explicitly was to ensure that it could withstand challenges, the defense official said.

“The decision to not name a specific prohibited flag was to ensure the department-wide policy would be apolitical and withstand potential free speech political challenges,” the official said.

Most U.S. military services, including the Marine Corps, have already banned the display of Confederate flags, but Esper’s memorandum is department-wide and will affect military installations around the world.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-race-usa-pentagon/pentagon-issues-de-facto-ban-on-confederate-flag-at-military-bases-idUSKCN24I23K
Donors give computers to Ghana school where teacher taught computer tech on a blackboard,Ghanaian teacher who Taught his Students How to use mS word on a blackboard gets computers donated to his school,1.0,"(CNN) With just a blackboard and a talent for drawing, a Ghanaian teacher has explained in detail to his students the secrets of Microsoft Word, earning numerous headlines and worldwide admiration.

Now Richard Appiah Akoto, who gained fame last month for teaching computer technology without computers at Betenase M/A Junior High School in the southern Ghana town of Sekyedumase, is starting to appreciate the fruits of his unexpected media attention.

People and organizations are donating desktop computers and laptops to his school. And, as part of Microsoft's promise to offer him free training, Akoto was flown to Singapore to attend the annual Microsoft Educators Exchange.

Anthony Salcito, vice president of worldwide education for Microsoft, meets with Richard Appiah Akoto.

The tech giant had pledged to equip Akoto with a device from a business partner as well as access to the Microsoft Certified Educator Program (MCE) for professional development.

'Knowledge is crucial'

After reading the Facebook post that made Akoto famous, a Saudi benefactor at University of Leeds in the UK sent him a laptop ""as a small gift to his students.""

""I always understand from the teachings of Islam that useful knowledge is crucial for the benefit of the self and humanity,"" Amirah Alharthi, a PhD student in Leeds' department of statistics, told CNN.

""Also, I am thinking of how much genius people the world has already lost because these people did not have the fair opportunities comparing to others and that makes me very sad.""

Betenase M/A Junior High School hasn't had a computer since 2011, and Akoto's students need to pass a national exam that includes questions on information and communication technology (ICT).

The written exam is a requisite for 14- and 15-year-olds in Ghana to progress to high school.

Five desktops and a laptop

But Alharthi's gift wasn't the only one.

Inspired by the teacher's story, NIIT Ghana, a computer training school based in Accra, donated five desktop computers to the school, along with books and a laptop for Akoto.

NIIT's center manager, Ashish Kumar, told CNN he saw the teacher's photos going viral on Facebook and CNN as well as other media organizations.

""We were so touched by the teacher's dedication for his students that we decided to support the school with the best we can do,"" he said. ""We took (a) printout of the news, pasted on our notice board and shared it with our CEO, Kapil Gupta.""

The company's senior management, including business head Yaw Amoateng and senior manager Sanjeev Mishra, traveled to Sekyedumase to present the equipment to the class.

Mom with 'gut feeling' stops school shooter before planned attack,Mom with 'gut feeling' stops school shooter before planned attack,1.0,"A suspicious mom who followed her instincts helped prevent a mass school shooting.

On Wednesday, Koeberle Bull of Lumberton, N.J., woke up to a racist message on Facebook from a man in Kentucky. “It was really vulgar — he called my kids the N-word and hoped terrible things for them,” Bull tells Yahoo Lifestyle.

The mom of three biracial children, ages 16, 11, and 8, was especially concerned about the man’s profile picture in which he showed off a gun, so, going on a “gut feeling,” she called her local police station and filed a report. “But I felt like it wouldn’t really go anywhere, so I posted a screenshot of the message on Facebook,” she says.

The man had blocked Bull. However, her friends dug around for details about his identity, and Bull soon had enough information to share with the police in Lawrenceburg, Ky. “I spoke to Officer Josh Satterly, who told me, ‘There’s no room for this kind of hate in my world,” she says. “He took me seriously.”

Local and state police followed the mom’s tip, and on Thursday, officers drove to the home of a 20-year-old man named Dylan Jarrell, just as he was leaving his house with more than 200 rounds of ammunition, a bulletproof vest, a firearm, a 100-round high-capacity magazine, and a “detailed plan of attack.” He was headed toward two school districts in Anderson County and Shelby County, the Kentucky State Police said in a press conference Friday.

“There’s no doubt in my mind that as a result of this investigation, we saved lives,” Kentucky State Police Commissioner Rick Sanders said during the press conference. “This young man had it in his mind to go to schools and create havoc.

“He had the tools necessary, the intent necessary. And the only thing that stood between him and evil … is law enforcement,” he added.

When police searched Jarrell’s home, they found an internet search history on “How to conduct a school shooting” and a “credible and imminent threat to Shelby and Anderson County schools,” according to a press release. Police also revealed that in May, Jarrell had been questioned by the FBI regarding social media threats toward a Tennessee school.

Story continues

Jarrell was charged with two counts of second-degree terroristic threatening and one count of harassing communications and is being held in the Shelby County Detention Center.

Sheila Mitchell of Anderson County Public Schools tells Yahoo Lifestyle that classes were closed on Friday due to concern for student safety. “I commend [Bull] for her courage and willingness to follow through on the threat and the collaborative efforts of local and state law enforcement. We’re very blessed and grateful.”

Bull has received grateful invitations to visit families from all over the country and says the timing of the arrest was “divine intervention.”

She also encourages people to report social media messages of concern. “That one-in-a-million call could prevent a tragedy,” Bull tells Yahoo Lifestyle. “I’m thankful everyone is OK.”

Janette Maas, a 61-year-old retired airline pilot, had finished her weekly shopping at a Maretta Kroger during the 7 a.m. seniors-only hour Wednesday and thought something was amiss because the self check-out lanes were closed. The cashier told her an anonymous donor had covered her $60 in groceries, and her receipt said ""Atlanta Angel."" ""I got my Kroger fuel points,"" she said.

She later heard Perry was the donor, and said she was thinking of finding a Madea movie to watch later as thanks.

How much money Perry will end up shelling out is unclear, but it could be well in the six figures.

Pakistan’s virus-idled workers hired to plant trees,"Pakistan begins colossal tree planting campaign - a staggering 10 billion trees will be planted starting now in order to combat climate change using 60,000 workers who have lost their jobs because of the coronavirus",1.0,"Officials say move will create more than 60,000 jobs as gov’t aims to help those who lost jobs due to COVID-19 lockdown.

When construction worker Abdul Rahman lost his job to Pakistan’s coronavirus lockdown, his choices looked stark – resort to begging on the streets or let his family go hungry.

But the government has now given him a better option: Join tens of thousands of other out-of-work labourers in planting billions of trees across the country to deal with climate change threats.

Since Pakistan locked down on March 23 to try to stem the spread of COVID-19, unemployed day labourers have been given new jobs as “jungle workers”, planting saplings as part of the country’s 10 Billion Tree Tsunami programme.

Such “green stimulus” efforts are an example of how funds that aim to help families and keep the economy running during pandemic shutdowns could also help nations prepare for the next big threat: climate change.

“Due to coronavirus, all the cities have shut down and there is no work. Most of us daily wagers couldn’t earn a living,” Rahman, a resident of Rawalpindi district in Punjab province, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

He now makes 500 rupees ($3) a day planting trees – about half of what he might have made on a good day, but enough to get by.

“All of us now have a way of earning daily wages again to feed our families,” he said.

The ambitious five-year tree-planting programme, which Prime Minister Imran Khan launched in 2018, aims to counter rising temperatures, flooding, droughts and other extreme weather conditions in the country that scientists link to climate change.

Big risks

The Global Climate Risk Index 2020, issued by think-tank Germanwatch, ranked Pakistan fifth on a list of countries most affected by planetary heating over the last 20 years – even though the South Asian nation contributes only a fraction of global greenhouse gases.

As the coronavirus pandemic struck Pakistan, the 10 Billion Trees campaign was initially halted as part of social distancing orders put in place to slow the spread of the virus, which has infected more than 14,880 people in Pakistan, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.

But earlier this month, the prime minister granted an exemption to allow the forestry agency to restart the programme and create more than 63,600 jobs, according to government officials.

A recent assessment by the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics found that, due to the lockdown, up to 19 million people could be laid off, almost 70 perfect of them in the Punjab province.

Abdul Muqeet Khan, chief conservator of forests for Rawalpindi district, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that the planting project is in “full swing”.

Much of the work is happening on 15,000 acres (6,000 hectares) of land near the capital Islamabad, he said, as well as on other tracts of state-owned forest land around the country.

This year, the programme is employing triple the number of workers it did in its first year, said Malik Amin Aslam, climate change adviser to the prime minister.

Many of the new jobs are being created in rural areas, he said, with a focus on hiring women and unemployed daily workers – mainly young people – who were migrating home from locked-down cities.

The work, which pays between 500-800 rupees ($3-5) a day, includes setting up nurseries, planting saplings, and serving as forest protection guards or forest firefighters, he said.

All the workers have been told to wear masks and maintain the mandated two metres (six feet) of social distance between them, he added.

“This tragic crisis provided an opportunity and we grabbed it,” Aslam told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a phone interview.

“Nurturing nature has come to the economic rescue of thousands of people.”

Extended help

According to Germanwatch, Pakistan reported more than 150 extreme weather events between 1999 and 2018 – from floods to heatwaves – with total losses of $3.8bn.

Environmentalists have long pushed reforestation as a way to help, saying forests help prevent flooding, stabilise rainfall, provide cool spaces, absorb heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions and protect biodiversity.

According to green group WWF, Pakistan is a “forest poor” country where trees cover less than 6 percent of the total area.

With 7.5 billion rupees ($46m) in funding, the 10 Billion Trees project aims to scale up the success of an earlier Billion Tree Tsunami in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where the government has been planting trees since 2014.

200414082202927

About 30 million Indigenous saplings have been planted in Punjab since the start of the 10 Billion Tree Tsunami – including mulberry, acacia and moringa – said Shahid Rashid Awan, project director for Punjab province.

This year, the project hopes to hit 50 million trees, he said.

Planting season usually ends in May, Awan noted, but programme organisers plan to extend the initiative to the end of June, to keep workers employed for longer.

“We can absorb all the unemployed labourers and workers who have fled the cities and returned to their villages in the past few weeks. This is unskilled work,” he said.

Recovering with dignity

Rab Nawaz, of WWF-Pakistan, said the government’s move is “a very good idea to create green jobs and get people employed”.

But he cautioned that planting trees is just one tool in the fight against climate change, saying there also needed to be an investment in improving the ability of farmers and city dwellers to adapt to the effects of a hotter planet.

“The government should be very selective on how it spends money, and focus on resilience,” he urged.

For Aslam, the green jobs initiative is a way to help Pakistan’s workers recover from the coronavirus crisis “with dignity and avoiding handouts”.

“This has taught us the valuable lesson that when you invest in nature it not only pays you back, but also rescues you in a stressed economic situation,” he said.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/04/pakistan-virus-idled-workers-hired-plant-trees-200429070109237.html

Trader Joe's is planning to pay bonuses to store employees amid an ""unprecedented increase"" in sales due to the coronavirus pandemic, according to an internal company memo.

The memo, which was reviewed by Business Insider, said the grocer is planning to set up a ""special bonus pool"" for each store based on the recent sales increases.

Each store's bonus pool will be divided equally among store employees based on their hours worked during the sales period, according to the memo.

""We want to acknowledge the incredible hard work and dedication of our Crew Members in supporting each other and our communities by sharing the financial benefit of this sales increase with our store crew who have worked so hard during the past several weeks, and for as long as this challenge remains,"" the memo said.

The memo was sent Monday, one day after a petition started circulating online demanding that Trader Joe's give workers hazard pay and guaranteed wages in case of store closures. Hazard pay is extra compensation for employees exposed to dangerous conditions. The petition asks for a hazard-pay rate of time-and-a-half.

""Trader Joe's workers — from the distribution warehouses to the stores — need hazard pay now,"" says the petition, which had more than 10,000 signatures as of Tuesday.

Pope Francis to parents of L.G.B.T. children: ‘God loves your children as they are.’,Pope Francis to parents of L.G.B.T. children: ‘God loves your children as they are.’,1.0,"Pope Francis told a group of parents of L.G.B.T. children yesterday that “God loves your children as they are” and “the church loves your children as they are because they are children of God.” He did so in a brief encounter with some 40 Italian parents (both mothers and fathers) of L.G.B.T. children after the public audience in the Renaissance courtyard of San Damaso in the Vatican.

The parents are members of an Italian association, Tenda di Gionata (“Jonathan’s Tent”), which welcomes and provides information and formation to L.G.B.T. Christians, their families and pastoral workers. The association was founded in 2018 by people inspired by a Catholic priest, the late Rev. David Esposito from the Diocese of Fermo in the Marches region of Italy.

Mara Grassi, the vice president of the association, together with her husband Agostino Usai—both wearing masks—presented the pope with a booklet titled “Genitori Fortunati” (“Fortunate Parents”) that documented the experiences of these parents with the church, experiences that were at times far from easy, and their requests for acceptance despite all too often being considered “undesirable” by church communities.

Mara Grassi told Pope Francis, “We wish to create a bridge to the church so that the church too can change its way of looking at our children, no longer excluding them but fully welcoming them.”

Speaking afterward to Avvenire, the daily paper of the Italian Bishops’ Conference, Ms. Grassi said she told the pope that “our association aims to foster dialogue between the church and the families of L.G.B.T. [people].” Taking her cue from the booklet’s title, she confided to him, “We consider ourselves fortunate because we had to change the way that we had always looked at our children. We found a new way of looking that enabled us to see in them the beauty and love of God.”

According to her account of the conversation, she told Francis, “We wish to create a bridge to the church so that the church too can change its way of looking at our children, no longer excluding them but fully welcoming them.”

Having listened carefully to what she said, Pope Francis reassured her, “The church does not exclude them because she loves them deeply.”

As he bade them farewell, the association gave the pope a rainbow-colored T-shirt with the words “In love there is no fear” emblazoned on it.

Speaking to La Repubblica, the Italian daily, after the audience, Ms. Grassi, a Catholic mother of four children—the eldest of whom is a gay person, now aged 40—said she experienced “very strong emotions” in her encounter with Pope Francis.

She revealed that “for many years I was like a blind person. After I came to know that my son was homosexual, I suffered a lot because the rules of the church made me think that he was excluded from the love of God. Nobody helped me.”

Things changed, she said, when she attended a vigil against homophobia at the church of Regina Pacis in Reggio Emilia, a city in northern Italy. There she met other parents, believers like herself, who have children that are gay, and through these parents she met the Rev. Paolo Cugini, who helped her understand that “faith and homosexuality are not in opposition, and that God loves my son as he is.”

She told the pope that she is the mother of a son who is gay and “who left the church because he did not feel accepted in his diversity.” She explained how, thanks to her son, she changed her way of seeing things and like other persons in the same situation, after being “destabilized at first” on learning of her son’s homosexuality, she has come to see that “we are fortunate parents.”

She said the pope, in response, assured her and the other parents present that “God loves our children because they are all children of God.” And when she requested that the church, too, should change its ways so that no one feels excluded, Francis reassured them saying, “The church loves our children as they are.”",https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2020/09/17/pope-francis-parents-lgbt-children-god-loves-your-children-they-are
Blood donation breakthrough sees scientists convert all types to O using gut bacteria,"In a breakthrough that could save thousands of lives, researchers from the University of British Columbia have figured out how to convert blood types A, B and AB into the universal Type O, which all patients can receive in a transfusion, regardless of their own blood type.",1.0,"In a breakthrough that could save thousands of lives, scientists have found a way to convert all blood types to the universal type that is safe for all patients to receive, by using microbes found in the human gut.

Researchers from the University of British Columbia have figured out how to convert blood types A, B and AB into the universal Type O, which all patients can receive in a transfusion, regardless of their own blood type.

Blood types are differentiated by the kinds of sugar found on the surface of red blood cells. Type O has no sugars. Scientists had realized that some enzymes can remove the sugars from A, B and AB blood cells, turning them into Type O, but they hadn’t found an enzyme that was safe, efficient and economical, until they considered the gut.

The human digestive tract has the same sugars found on blood cells, and bacterial enzymes found in feces strip the sugars from the lining to aid digestion. The scientists were able to isolate the enzyme and use it to strip blood of its sugars in a more efficient way than any other enzyme.

The scientists made the exciting discovery last August, but have just published the results of their research in the journal Nature Microbiology.

North Texas Investor Uses GameStop Gains to Help Sick Children,"Texas investor uses GME gains to buy Nintendo Switches from Gamestop, and donates them to a Children's Hospital.",1.0,"Amid the Wall Street drama surrounding GameStop and Robinhood, some investors taking part in the GameStop short sale are using their proceeds to do good deeds for others.

One investor, who wished to remain anonymous, delivered 10 Nintendo switches purchased from GameStop locations around the Dallas-Fort Worth area to Medical City Children's Hospital Thursday.

The investor said his efforts were made possible by GME gains.

Wall Street has been rattled this week by an organized campaign by small investors to take on large hedge funds by driving up shares of Grapevine-based GameStop and other struggling retailers.

The campaign started on Reddit and other discussion boards as small investors encouraged each other to buy GameStop stock, forcing the bigger players like hedge funds to cover their bets by buying the stock, increasing the price even further.

The anonymous investor who donated the Nintendo Switches said they made ""a good amount through r/WallStreetBets on this hilarious GME trade"" and felt inspired to give back ""in a way that was equally hilarious.""

Firefighters 'could not find fire' at Notre Dame 23 minutes before blaze,"The Bishop of Paris, in tears, has told the French press that After fear of their destruction, all 3 irreplaceable Rose Windows, considered the greatest medieval artwork still in existence, have survived. They took years to build in the 13th century.",1.0,"Advertisement

The treasures that survived the devastating Notre Dame inferno have been revealed - with the great organ and several priceless paintings rumoured been destroyed.

Franck Riester, France's culture minister, said on Tuesday that the cathedral's main organ 'seems to be quite affected' by the blaze while the fate of several other artefacts remains unknown.

Firefighters reported that some of the large paintings inside the cathedral were too heavy to take down from the walls and save.

Mr Riester said the paintings were mostly undamaged but many may have suffered some effects from the smoke.

'The large paintings, at first glance, have not been affected by the fire. But, often in these situations, there is water damage,' Mr. Riester added.

It comes as it was reported officials attending the Notre Dame blaze initially couldn't find any sign of fire despite the alarm being raised 23 minutes before the structure went up in flames.

Paris public prosecutor Rémy Heitz announced on Tuesday that firefighters were called to the world-famous cathedral at 6.20pm CET, almost half an hour before the roof caught fire after a fire alarm was triggered.

But after an initial inspection they said they were unable to find any evidence of fire.

Firefighters remained inside Notre Dame until a second alarm went off at 6.43pm and eventually discovered a fire in the network of wooden beams under the cathedral's roof - but were unable to put it out.

Mr Heitz said this evening: 'What we know at this stage is that there was an initial alarm at 6:20 p.m., followed by a procedure to verify this but no fire as found.

'Then, there was a second alarm at 6:43 p.m. and at that point a fire was detected in the structure.

'The investigation is going to be long and complex,' he added. 'We are in the process of interviewing witnesses.'

A robot fires water from a hose to douse the flames in the cathedral on Monday night

After eventually responding to the blaze, French firefighters were filmed racing into the burning Notre Dame to save the 850-year-old cathedral from destruction.

The fearless rescue team charged into the inferno with huge flames leaping across the church and sparks tumbling from the ceiling after the roof of the Paris landmark caught fire.

Firefighters battled for eight hours to contain the blaze which destroyed the cathedral's roof and spire, but despite fears that the whole building could collapse the stone structure and iconic bell towers remain standing today.

The firefighters' actions - and their quick deployment of a robot to hose down the cathedral - meant that priceless treasures including reputed relics of the Crucifixion and 13th-century stained-glass windows were saved from the blaze.

Today haunting new photos of Notre Dame's interior showed debris strewn across the floor - as experts warned the damage could take decades to repair - while detectives probe the renovation work which may have led to the blaze.

The pictures revealed that a statue of Jesus descending from the cross, positioned on the altar, was preserved among the smouldering rubble after the roof was destroyed by Monday night's fire.

The three 'irreplaceable' Rose Windows, which date to the 13th century and were last night feared to have melted or exploded, were also intact.

Attention has now turned to what may have caused Notre Dame, part of which was being restored in a €150million refurbishment, to fall victim to such a disaster.

The focus of prosecutors is currently on contractors Le Bras Freres, whose owner Julien Le Bras last year boasted his firm's goal was 'to keep as many old items as possible and not to put the building at risk' after they were awarded a €5.7m (£5m, $6.5m) contract as part of the cathedral's restoration project.

Detectives investigating the catastrophic blaze are today interviewing specialist restorers who were carrying out works on the cathedral spire when the inferno broke out.

French police are understood to have launched a criminal inquiry after a 'stray flame' caused fire to engulf the landmark last night, with heroic firefighters battling for eight hours to bring the blaze under control.

The Paris prosecutor's office is probing 'involuntary destruction caused by fire', indicating authorities are treating the blaze as a tragic accident and not arson or terrorism.

'Nothing suggests that it was a voluntary act,' Remy Heitz told reporters outside the Gothic cathedral, adding that the workers employed at the site were being questioned over Monday's blaze.

Fears for the treasures of Notre Dame: Christ's 'crown of thorns' is saved, but fragment of the Cross and nails 'used to crucify Jesus' unaccounted for The fate of many of the Notre Dame's treasures is still unknown after the huge fire which ripped through the 850-year-old cathedral on Monday. Experts are today entering the wreckage of the Paris landmark to find which of the precious artworks and religious relics have been saved. The mayor of Paris said that one of the most irreplaceable items - the crown of thorns reputed to have been worn by Jesus at his crucifixion - was safe last night. But there are fears for the church's 13th-century stained glass windows and its magnificent organ, while the wooden roof and ornate spire have gone. Safe: Crown of thorns One of the cathedral's most precious objects, a relic purported to be the crown of thorns worn by Jesus Christ on the cross, was whisked away to a secure facility. Reports in France stated that the chaplain of the Paris fire brigade had gone inside with the firefighters to save the crown. Experts said the irreplaceable item had been kept in a 'very safe place'. Records of the Crown of Thorns existence begin in the sixth century AD, when it is believed to have been kept in Jerusalem by Christians. During the Crusades in 1238, the Latin Emperor of Constantinople gave it to King Louis IX to win his support and try and preserve his crumbling empire. Louis IX brought the crown back to France and was later made a saint. Although the crown itself was saved, a small fragment of the crown had been kept in the spire and is therefore believed to have burned to ashes. Unknown: True Cross and Holy Nails Another of the cathedral's relics is a purported piece of the True Cross - the very instrument on which Jesus was crucified in the first century AD. The collection also includes a nail which is said to be from the cross. It was unclear on Tuesday morning whether these had been saved along with the Crown of Thorns. Safe: Tunic of St Louis A 13th-century linen tunic which is thought to have belonged to King Louis IX - canonised as St Louis - was also made safe, the mayor of Paris said. In his 44-year reign Louis took part in the Crusades and established early principles of justice such as the presumption of innocence. He was proclaimed a saint in 1297 - the only French monarch to receive the honour - and was responsible for acquiring the Crown of Thorns. Safe: North, West and South Rose Windows The magnificent stained-glass artworks in the cathedral date back to the 13th century. There were fears last night that they would melt or explode but the Archbishop of Paris told BFM-TV today that they were safe. A French journalist at the scene last night said the north window appeared to be safe with no sign of broken glass although firefighters remained concerned. Architecture professor Julio Bermudez said the stained glass windows were 'really irreplaceable'. Advertisement

Some of the firm's 200 specialist employees were working at the site where the fire is thought to have originated, the cathedral's 300ft-tall wooden and lead spire, which collapsed in front of crowds of horrified Parisians at 8pm.

A source close to the inquiry said that many of the restorers had been interviewed overnight, with prosecutors focusing on the equipment used at the 850-year-old cathedral, where light and power sources were limited.

In such circumstances, hordes of cables and wires would have to be attached to dozens of generators, which would then be hoisted high up on to medieval building.

'The fear is that a small fire began in the rood where they were working,' the source added.

'The irony is that the restorers had just begun working on the spire which collapsed along with much of the roof.'

Le Bras Freres is one of the most respected companies of its kind in France, and last year finished a widespread restoration programme of Reims Cathedral in the east of the country.

The firm had won the €5.7million contract to restore the Notre Dame spire, which was designed by the architect Eugene Viollet-le-Duc and erected in 1859.

They were due to be on site for up to four years along with Europe Scaffolding, another company which had just put 250 tons of scaffolding around Notre Dame, along with a lift that could move up and down the 300ft spire.

The blaze, which broke out as the last crowds of tourists ended visits at around 7pm, was finally declared to be 'fully extinguished' at about 9.45am this morning.

As the fire raged, brave rescue teams raced to recover what treasures they could from the Gothic masterpiece, which housed priceless artefacts and relics of huge religious and international significance.

Among them was the reputed Crown of Thorns, supposedly worn by Jesus during his crucifixion, which was carried to safety by a human chain of emergency service workers.

Today the Archbishop of Paris told BFM-TV that the three beautiful rose windows on the north, west and south sides of the church had all survived intact.

Fears had grown for the 'really irreplaceable' stained-glass windows, dating back to the 13th century, amid the heat of the fire last night.

The status of other relics, including a purported piece of the Cross on which Jesus was crucified, remained unclear today.

French priest Jean-Marc Fournier led the efforts to save the Crown of Thorns.

Etienne Loraillere, an editor for France's KTO Catholic television network, said Father Fournier 'went with the firefighters into Notre Dame Cathedral to save the Crown of Thorns and the Blessed Sacrament'.

This was confirmed by an emergency services source who said: 'Father Fournier is an absolute hero.

'He showed no fear at all as he made straight for the relics inside the Cathedral, and made sure they were saved. He deals with life and death every day, and shows no fear.'

More than 400 firemen were needed to tame the inferno that consumed the roof and collapsed the spire of the eight-centuries-old cathedral. They worked through the night to bring the fire under control some 14 hours after it began.

France's richest man Bernard Arnault pledges €200MILLION to repair Notre Dame - doubling the €100million donated by Salma Hayek's billionaire husband France's richest man has pledged €200m (£170m) towards the restoration of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, doubling the donation of Salma Hayek's husband. Multi-billionaire Bernard Arnault, head of the LVMH luxury goods group, instantly became the biggest benefactor of an appeal launched by President Emmanuel Macron. On Monday – the day of the blaze – French tycoon Francois-Henri Pinault, who is married to Hollywood actress Salma Hayek, pledged 100 million euros (£86.2 million) towards the rebuilding of the Cathedral. But, in a statement, the LVMH group said their donation would be double that. It said: 'The Arnault family and the LVMH group, in solidarity with this national tragedy, are associated with the reconstruction of this extraordinary cathedral, symbol of France, its heritage and its unity. A statement from Francois-Henri Pinault said: 'This tragedy impacts all French people' and 'everyone wants to restore life as quickly as possible to this jewel of our heritage.' Advertisement

One firefighter was injured; no one else was reported hurt in the blaze which began after the building was closed to the public for the evening.

Shortly after the the blaze broke out, French fashion mogul Francois-Henri Pinault, the husband of Mexican-American actress Salma Hayek, pledged 100million euros (£86 million) towards the restoration effort.

Hours later, French billionaire Bernard Arnault announced that his family and his LVMH luxury goods group would donate 200million euros to help with repairs.

French President Emmanuel Macron has vowed to rebuild the cathedral, whatever the cost.

He said in a speech outside the church: 'We will appeal to the greatest talents and we will rebuild Notre-Dame because that's what the French are waiting for, because that's what our history deserves, because it's our deepest destiny.'

Pope Francis said Tuesday he hoped everyone would pull together to rebuild the devastated Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris following a massive fire.

'I hope the Notre-Dame cathedral may once again become, thanks to reconstruction work and the mobilization of all, a jewel in the heart of the city,' Francis said in a statement issued by the Vatican.

Leaders from around the world offered their condolences to France. Among them was Queen Elizabeth II, who said: 'Prince Philip and I have been deeply saddened to see the images of the fire which has engulfed Notre-Dame Cathedral.

'I extend my sincere admiration to the emergency services who have risked their lives to try to save this important national monument.

'My thoughts and prayers are with those who worship at the Cathedral and all of France at this difficult time.'

Notre Dame had previously the site of a terror scare in 2016 when a car carrying seven gas cylinders was found near the cathedral.

Three women were arrested over the alleged terror plot, although they were thought to have been targeting a Paris railway station rather than the cathedral itself.

Police have made clear today that they believe Monday night's fire was an accident.

Investigators will not be able to enter the cathedral's blackened nave until experts are satisfied its stone walls withstood the heat and the building is structurally sound.

'The fire is fully extinguished,' fire service spokesman Gabriel Plus told reporters. 'Our job today is to monitor the structure and its movements.'

The fire swiftly ripped through the cathedral's timbered roof supports, where workmen had been carrying out extensive renovations to collapsed balustrades and crumbling gargoyles, as well as the spire's wooden frame.

The hero who saved the Crown of Thorns: Fire brigade chaplain entered flaming Notre Dame to recover holy relic - three years after he bravely helped Bataclan terror victims Father Jean-Marc Fournier, chaplain of the Paris Fire Brigade, saved the Blessed Sacrament and the Crown of Thorns from the blazing Notre Dame cathedral A French priest who helped comfort the wounded after the Bataclan terror attack today also emerged as a hero of the Notre Dame fire. Jean-Marc Fournier, chaplain of the Paris Fire Brigade, saved the Blessed Sacrament and the Crown of Thorns from the blazing cathedral on Monday night. It was feared that both religious artefacts would be lost as flames engulfed the medieval building, but Father Fournier made sure they were taken to safety.

Hundreds of stunned onlookers had lined the banks of the Seine river late into the night as the fire raged, reciting prayers and singing liturgical music in harmony as they stood in vigil.

'It's a symbol of our country that risked being destroyed,' Culture Minister Franck Riester said.

Notre-Dame is owned by the state and has been at the centre of a years-long row between the nation and the Paris archdiocese over who should bear the brunt of costs for badly needed restoration work.

Paolo Violini, a restoration specialist for Vatican museums, said the pace at which the fire spread through the cathedral had been stunning.

'We are used to thinking about them as eternal simply because they have been there for centuries, or a thousand years, but the reality is they are very fragile,' Violini said.

American tourist Susan Hargrove said she'd been left breathless by the scale of devastation.

'We are talking of world history, of our Western culture but also of something that is truly universal,' Hargrove said. 'Notre-Dame means something to everybody.'

Firefighters also struggled to take down many of the large paintings in the cathedral, administrative cleric Monsignor Patrick Chauvet said, meaning the scale of the devastation will not be known for some time.

A French cultural heritage expert this morning claimed that France no longer has trees big enough to replace ancient wooden beams that fell during the blaze.

But at the height of the inferno, many feared the entire building would be lost.

'If Paris is the Eiffel Tower then France is Notre Dame. It's the entire culture, entire history of France incarnated in this monument,' Bernard Lecomte, a writer and specialist in religious history told French TV.

In Washington, Donald Trump tweeted: 'So horrible to watch the massive fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris.'

The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby sent the best wishes of the Anglican church to people at the scene. 'Tonight we pray for the firefighters tackling the tragic Notre Dame fire - and for everyone in France and beyond who watches and weeps for this beautiful, sacred place where millions have met with Jesus Christ,' he said.

And British Prime Minister Theresa May added: 'My thoughts are with the people of France tonight and with the emergency services who are fighting the terrible blaze.'

There was an air of mourning in Paris as the sun rose on Tuesday with hundreds of people gathering on the banks of the Seine to view the devastation at Notre Dame.

An elderly woman wondered whether the fire was a sign from god, saying: 'Notre Dame is our soul. The soul of France.

'We are a Catholic country, a republic but a Catholic country nonetheless - nobody remembers that any more.'

She said she had heard the statue of the Virgin Mary had been saved, adding that it could be a miracle.

Another woman said: 'I think it can be rebuilt, but it could take years and years - I am 79 and today, I don't know if I will ever see Notre Dame whole again.'

As the sun rose over the building, ashes from the cathedral's spire blew across the banks of the river, along with the blossom from Notre Dame's gardens.

Miraculously, the trees and vines around the building on Ile de la Cite were barely singed, while the bell towers and the enormous circular window of the nave appeared to be intact.

Despite the fierce heat that consumed Notre Dame's spire, scaffolding previously erected for restoration work was also still standing.

One refuse working collecting litter on the banks of the Seine said: 'It's incredible (the scaffolding) didn't fall.'

Daniel Etieve, 70, said: 'It's a very sad picture. For over 800 years this cathedral has been passed from generation to generation.

Firefighters douse flames billowing from the roof as they try to stop the flames spreading. Nobody has been injured, junior interior minister Laurent Nunez said at the scene, adding: 'It's too early to determine the causes of the fire'

'Now I question what state we will pass it on to the generations after us.'

One man, who gave his name only as Fabrice, said he was grieving for the incredible timber beams and wooden carvings that characterised Notre Dame's vaulted ceiling.

The 55-year-old art historian said: 'The ceiling was known as 'the forest' because of all the thousands of trees that were cut to build it. I feel very sad but also I am happy that most of the building is still here.'

He added that Notre Dame has been built over many centuries and that he took comfort in the way the British had repaired Windsor Castle after the fire of 1992.

'But it's hard to believe that this is happening in Paris - part of ourselves has been destroyed,' he said.

'I always go for a walk in this area every day and come to see Notre Dame. It's like coming to visit an elderly parent.'

One commuter said: 'I come often to Notre Dame for mass and to pray and (the damage) is tearing at my heart.'

But he added: 'Luckily it was saved. It was not completely destroyed and, as the president said, we will have money to rebuild it and I hope it will be even more beautiful.'

Accountant Martin Cassan, 32, was hopeful for the future. He had come down to the scene with friends to watch the cathedral burn on Monday evening.

He said: 'There's nothing you can do but have a drink. You feel sad. You definitely feel sad.'

French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted shortly after the fire broke out that he was sad to see 'a part of us burn' and sent his sympathies to people across France

But he asked: 'Should it be (rebuilt) exactly the same as before? Will it be like the Louvre - will we have a pyramid in the middle of it?'

Another onlooker, who gave his name only as Clement, said: 'As sad as it is, it reminds us that buildings are just temporary, just as we are.'

During the French Revolution in the 18th century, the cathedral was vandalised in widespread anti-Catholic violence. Its spire was dismantled, its treasures plundered and its large statues at the grand entrance doors destroyed.

It would go on to feature as a central character in a Victor Hugo novel published in 1831, 'The Hunchback of Notre-Dame' and shortly afterwards a restoration project lasting two decades got under way, led by architect Eugene Viollet-le-Duc.

The building survived the devastation of two global conflicts in the 20th century and famously rang its bells on August 24, 1944, the day of the Liberation of Paris from German occupation at the end of the World War II.

Before yesterday's blaze it was in the midst of renovations, with some sections under scaffolding, and bronze statues had been removed last week for works.

Its 330ft-long roof, of which a large section was consumed in the first hour of the blaze, was one of the oldest such structures in Paris.

Parisians took to the city's streets last night to pray, sing and reminisce about Notre Dame cathedral as it burned before them

The emotions became too much for some locals who gathered in the shadow of the cathedral to watch its slow destruction

I walked through the gutted cathedral… then the crucifix shone from what remained of the altar, a symbol of defiance in the gloom: ROBERT HARDMAN is among first witnesses inside ravaged Notre Dame

Sparks and bits of flaming woodwork are still cascading from the remnants of the 12th-century roof.

The smell instantly sears the back of your throat like a dose of smelling salts and my feet are soaked. The ancient black and white tiles leading up the aisle are under a gently-flowing river of hose water from the fire crews pumping what seems like much of the River Seine from their elevated platforms.

Yet I can faithfully report that the Cathedral of Notre Dame is not entirely destroyed. Because I am standing inside it – alongside the French prime minister.

In the early hours of this morning, I was among the first people to be allowed inside the ruins of one of the world's finest cathedrals following the fire which has shocked not just the entire French nation but much of the planet.

A blaze which begin in the cathedral's loft at 6.30pm had turned into an all-consuming catastrophe by nightfall. Officials reported that the wooden interior of the medieval cathedral had been almost completely destroyed.

Certainly, Notre Dame's spire is no more. Great chunks of its eastern end are no more. Its world-famous stained glass windows are in smithereens and the whole edifice is open to the skies.

Smoke is seen around the alter inside Notre Dame cathedral on Monday evening. Miracolously the cross and altar have managed to survive the inferno

But Paris will wake today to see that the cathedral that has defied world wars, enemy occupations, revolutions and mobs galore is still poking its head above the Paris skyline.

And at 1am today, at the far end of the cathedral, illuminated by lingering embers and firefighters' equipment, I could just make out a stunning symbol of defiance through the gloom: the unmistakeable sight of a crucifix on what remains of the altar.

Notre Dame is gravely damaged. Yet its most spectacular features – the 850-year-old twin towers – are still there. For centuries, these were the highest structures in Paris until the Eiffel Tower came along. To this day, they are instantly recognisable the world over. And last night, though looking very sorry for themselves, they were in one piece as I stood beneath them alongside a posse of fire crews and prime ministerial aides.

Within hours, speculation was rife as to the cause of the fire. For now, it seems that it was what one official called a 'stray flame' – linked to a £5 million restoration project – which sparked the inferno.

Experts have warned for years that the cathedral has been in a poor condition, with the French state reluctant to fund renovation work in recent decades.

Experts said that the building needed a £129.5million (€150million) restoration, but the state had only offered €40million.

Pictures taken outside the cathedral and from the entrance hall in the early hours of Tuesday show emergency service personnel still working to make the site safe

The cathedral was seeking private donations to make up the rest.

The flames were first spotted just minutes after the building had closed to the public for the day. Echoing the fears of his entire country, French president Emmanuel Macron instantly declared a national emergency. 'Our Lady of Paris in flames,' he declared on Twitter. 'Like all our countrymen, I'm sad tonight to see this part of us burn.'

He has pledged to rebuild Notre Dame, saying: 'Notre Dame is our history, our imagination, where we've lived all our great moments, and is the epicentre of our lives.

'It's the story of our books, our paintings. It's the cathedral for all French people, even if they have never been. But it is burning and I know this sadness will be felt by all of our citizens.

'Tomorrow a national subscription will be launched for people around the country to help rebuild this great Notre Dame. Because that's what the French people want. That is what their history requires. Because that is our destiny.'

Questions were immediately asked about the way in which a fire could take such a rapid hold of one of the world's most visited – and most beloved – landmarks.

The firefighting response was also questioned as few, if any, high-pressure water hoses were able to reach the roof in the first hour. Critically, the Paris prosecutor has already opened an enquiry.

I arrived last night to find a dumbstruck City of Light still bathed in a dismal afterglow. Here, on the banks of the Seine, tens of thousands of people – of all nationalities – stared incredulously at the slow death of a part of France's soul.

The fire spread rapidly across the roof-line of the cathedral leaving one of the spires and another section of the roof engulfed in flames

To describe the cathedral of Notre Dame as a national monument is a grave understatement. Imagine Westminster Abbey, St Paul's Cathedral and the Tower of London all going up in smoke at the same time and you begin to appreciate the magnitude of this loss, except that Notre Dame attracts – or used to attract – twice as many annual visitors as those three London landmarks put together.

That is why, as news began to spread last night, Parisians flocked to the Seine. They came here not as voyeurs but as mourners. They came to pay their last respects. Some sang hymns. Many were in tears. Some brought flowers and cards to place they knew not where. Understandably, perhaps, no one saw fit to light a candle.

From medieval times, Notre Dame has marked the epochs in the story of this proud country and inspired one of the most famous literary masterpieces in the French language, The Hunchback of Notre Dame. This August marks the 75th anniversary of the day that General Charles De Gaulle marked the liberation of Paris within its walls, even as sporadic gunfire continued outside.

This is a city which was famously spared the destruction which history has wreaked on so many other European capitals. It really did feel blessed; almost eternal. Not any more. Those twin towers are now blackened and wide open to the elements. By midnight, however, the flames had died down as the first glimmers of firemen's torches could be seen here and there in the remains.

I joined what I can only describe as a requiem mass of Parisians chanting prayers on the Pont de Notre Dame. All approaches to the cathedral's island site had been sealed off to the public but crowds kept on coming from all directions for a glimpse.

'At least the two towers are still standing, and they must stay up so that Notre Dame can be reborn,' said civil servant Pascal Boichut, 52. There was a glimmer of hope when Paris fire brigade chief Jean-Claude Gallet told reporters: 'We consider that the main structure of Notre Dame has been preserved.'

In a statement the CEO of the Kering group, which owns Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent fashion houses, said the money towards 'the effort necessary to completely rebuild Notre Dame' would be paid by the Pinault family's investment firm Artemis.

Macron had earlier cancelled a major televised policy speech he was due to give on Monday evening to respond to months of protests, and instead headed to the scene in person.

He said while the 'worst had been avoided' and the facade and two towers saved, 'the next hours will be difficult'.

Paris fire brigade chief Jean-Claude Gallet said 'we can consider that the main structure of Notre Dame has been saved and preserved' as well as the two towers.

Deputy Interior Minister Laurent Nunez, also present at the scene on Monday evening, said that for the first time 'the fire had decreased in intensity' while still urging 'extreme caution'. The Vatican on Monday expressed its 'incredulity' and 'sadness', expressing 'our closeness with French Catholics and with the Parisian population.' The cause of the blaze was not immediately confirmed. The cathedral had been undergoing intense restoration work which the fire service said could be linked to the blaze. French prosecutors said it was being treated as an 'involuntary' fire, indicating that foul play was ruled out for now. Advertisement

Parisians applaud the firefighters who formed a human chain to save Notre Dame's priceless collection of art and relics – including the Crown Of Thorns from Jesus' crucifixion

Firefighters, police, and churchmen risked their lives last night to carry priceless historical artefacts and religious relics away from the flames which engulfed Notre Dame de Paris.

The Mayor of Paris tweeted her thanks to first responders for forming 'a formidable human chain' to save irreplaceable objects including the relic believed by Catholics to be the crown of thorns which was put on Jesus' head as he died on the cross.

Mayor Anne Hidalgo went on: 'The Crown of Thorns, the tunic of Saint Louis and several other major works are now in a safe place.'

Emergency responders worked with city staff to manhandle priceless relics away from the fire

Reliquaries, statues, and artefacts including the crown of thorns were saved from the fire by 'human chain'

And Father Fournier, Chaplain of the Paris Firefighters, told reporters he went into the burning cathedral to save the Blessed Sacrament and Crown of Thorns.

Parisians applauded and cheered fire crews as they drove through the streets in the early hours of the morning.

The church's treasure trove of priceless artworks and religious relics include the Crown of Thorns said to have been placed on the head of Jesus before he was crucified, a piece of the True Cross on which he is said to have died and a nail from the crucifixion.

The relics were obtained from the Byzantine Empire in 1238 and brought to Paris by King Louis IX.

Notre Dame is also home to priceless paintings dating back to the 1600s, including a series known as the Petits Mays, gifted to the cathedral once a year from 1630 to 1707.

Among the most celebrated artworks are three stained-glass rose windows high up on the west, north and south faces of the cathedral.

Shortly after midnight, Paris time, the artefacts had been safely transferred to a storage room

Notre Dame's Great Organ, which dates back to the 13th century and was restored in the early 1990s, is considered the most famous in the world, with five keyboards and nearly 8,000 pipes.

Last night firemen at the scene said all efforts were being directed at saving artwork in the cathedral and preventing the collapse of its northern tower.

'Everything is collapsing,' a police officer near the scene said as the cathedral continued to burn.

The ten bells of Notre Dame are renowned across Europe and the first nine are named Marie, Gabriel, Anne-Genevieve, Denis, Marcel, Etienne, Benoit-Joseph, Maurice, and Jean-Marie.

The final and largest, known as the bourdon bell Emmanuel, weighs more than 13 tonnes. It sits in the southern tower and has been a part of the building since 1681.

In 1944, Emmanuel was rung in celebration and triumph by French troops and allies to announce to the city that it was on its way to liberation.

The famous gargoyles and chimera that adorn Notre Dame were built in the 19th century by architect Eugene Viollet-le-Duc. The original purpose of the gargoyles was to assist with the building's drainage, but they have become one of its most-loved features.

In the 1790s, Notre Dame was desecrated during the French Revolution when much of its religious imagery was damaged or destroyed and its treasures plundered.

The 28 statues of biblical kings located at the west facade, mistaken for statues of French kings, were beheaded.

All of the other large statues on the facade, with the exception of that of the Virgin Mary on the portal of the cloister, were destroyed.

The cathedral was restored over 25 years after the publication of the book The Hunchback of Notre Dame by Victor Hugo in 1831 brought it into the spotlight.

Sixteen statues that were part of the cathedral's destroyed spire were safe and unscathed after being removed as part of a renovation a few days ago, and that the relics had also been saved.

The green-grey statues, representing the 12 apostles and four evangelists, were apparently lowered by cranes from the site and taken away.

The cathedral also has a spectacular series of carved wooden stalls and statues representing the Passion of the Christ.

Our Lady of Paris: The 850-year-old cathedral that survived being sacked in the Revolution to become Europe's most-visited historical monument Intrigued by tales of Quasimodo, fascinated by the gargoyles, or on a pilgrimage to see the Crown of Thorns said to have rested on Jesus' head on the Cross, more than 13 million people each year flock to see Europe's most popular historic monument. The 12th century Catholic cathedral is a masterpiece of French Gothic design, with a cavernous vaulted ceiling and some of the largest rose windows on the continent. It is the seat of the Archdiocese of Paris and its 69m-tall towers were the tallest structures in Paris until the completion of the Eiffel Tower in 1889. It survived a partial sacking by 16th century zealots and the destruction of many of its treasures during the atheist French Revolution but remains one of the greatest churches in the world and was the scene of Emperor Napoleon's coronation in 1804. A view of the middle-age stained glass rosace on the southern side of the Notre-Dame de Paris cathedral The foundation stone was laid in front of Pope Alexander III in 1163, with building work on the initial structure completed in 1260. The roof of the nave was constructed with a new technology: the rib vault. The roof of the nave was supported by crossed ribs which divided each vault into compartments, and the use of four-part rather than six-part rib vaults meant the roofs were stronger and could be higher. After the original structure was completed in the mid 13th century - following the consecration of the High altar in 1182 - flying buttresses had been invented, and were added to spread the weight of the mighty vault. The original spire was constructed in the 13th century, probably between 1220 and 1230. It was battered, weakened and bent by the wind over five centuries, and finally was removed in 1786. During a 19th century restoration, following desecration during the Revolution, it was recreated with a new version of oak covered with lead. The entire spire weighed 750 tons. At the summit of the spire were held three relics; a tiny piece of the Crown of Thorns, located in the treasury of the Cathedral; and relics of Denis and Saint Genevieve, patron saints of Paris. They were placed there in 1935 by the Archibishop Verdier, to protect the congregation from lightning or other harm. The Crown of Thorns was one of the great relics of medieval Christianity. It was acquired by Louis IX, king of France, in Constantinople in AD 1239 for the price of 135,000 livres - nearly half the annual expenditure of France. The elaborate reliquary in which just one of the thorns is housed sits in the Cathedral having been moved from the Saint-Chappelle church in Paris. The thorn is mounted on a large sapphire in the centre. The crown itself is also held in the cathedral, and is usually on view to the public on Good Friday - which comes at the end of this week. Notre-Dame de Paris is home to the relic accepted by Catholics the world over cathedral. The holy crown of thorns worn by Jesus Christ during the Passion During the 1790s with the country in the grip of atheist Revolution the cathedral was desecrated and much of its religious iconography destroyed. It was rededicated to the Cult of Reason and 28 statues of biblical kings - wrongly believed to by French monarchs - were beheaded. Even the great bells were nearly melted down. Napoleon returned the cathedral to the Catholic Church and was crowned Emperor there in 1804, but by the middle of the 19th century much of the iconic building. It wasn't until the publication of Victor Hugo's novel - The Hunchback of Notre Dame - in 1831 that public interest in the building resurfaced and repair works began. A major restoration project was launched in 1845 and took 25 years to be completed. Architects Jean-Baptiste-Antoine Lassus and Eugène Viollet-le-Duc won the commission. By 1944 the cathedral was to be damaged again and during the liberation of Paris, stray bullets caused minor damage to the medieval stained glass. This would be updated with modern designs. In 1963 France's Culture Minister, André Malraux, ordered the cleaning of the facade of the cathedral, where 800 years worth of soot and grime were removed. Notre Dame has a crypt, called the Crypte archéologique de l'île de la Cité, where old architectural ruins are stored. They span from the times of the earliest settlement in Paris to present day. The cathedral has 10 bells, the heaviest bell - known as the boudon and weighing 13 tonnes - is called Emmanuel and has been rung to mark many historical events throughout time. At the end of the First and Second World Wars the bell was rung to mark the end of the conflicts. It is also rung to signify poignant events such as French heads of state dying or following horrific events such as the terrorist attack on the Twin Towers in New York in 2001. The three stained glass rose windows are the most famous features of the cathedral. They were created in the Gothic style between 1225 and 1270. While most of the original glass is long gone, some remains in the south rose which dates back to the last quarter of the 12th century. The rest of the windows were restored in the 18th century. The south rose is made up of 94 medallions which are arranged in four concentric circles. They portray scenes from the life of Christ and those who knew him - with the inner circle showing the 12 apostles in it 12 medallions. During the French Revolution rioters set fire to the residence of the archbishop, which was around the side of the cathedral, and the south rose was damaged. One of the cathedral's first organs was built in 1403 by Friedrich Schambantz but was replaced in the 18th century before being remade using the pipe work from former instruments. The Cathedral is also home to a Catholic relic said to be a single thorn from the crown of thorns worn by Jesus on the cross. Advertisement

'It's burning to the ground': Trump tweets about massive fire as Notre Dame goes up in flames and suggests use of airborne water tankers – then questions the renovation work at the iconic cathedral

President Donald Trump tweeted about the massive fire engulfing Notre Dame Monday, suggesting the use of flying water tankers to douse the flames – then appeared to criticize renovation work that may have caused it.

Trump tweeted from aboard Air Force One en route to Minnesota, while viewers around the world were watching the iconic cathedral's in flames.

'So horrible to watch the massive fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. Perhaps flying water tankers could be used to put it out. Must act quickly!' Trump wrote while en route to Minnesota for an event about taxes.

Later, at his Tax Day event, Trump told a crowd about the 'terrible, terrible fire.'

'The fire that they're having at the Notre Dame Cathedral is something like few people have witnessed,' the president said.

President Donald Trump tweeted about the fire at Notre Dame Monday

The president suggested the use of airborne tankers

'When we left the plane, it was burning at a level that you rarely see a fire burn. It's one of the great treasures of the world,' Trump continued.

'It's one of the great treasures in the world. The greatest artists in the world. Probably if you think about it … it might be greater almost than any museum in the world and it's burning very badly. Looks like It's burning to the ground,' the president added, as firefighters struggled to contain the blaze.

Trump said he had a 'communication' with France but did not specify if he spoke to French authorities.

'That puts a damper on what we're about to say to be honest,' Trump told his audience in Minnesota. 'Because that is beyond countries. That's beyond anything. That's a part of our growing up it's a part of our culture, it's a part of our lives. That's a truly great cathedral. And I've been there and I've seen it … There's probably no cathedral in the world like it,' Trump said.

'They think it was caused by renovation. And I hope that's the reason,' Trump continued. Renovation. What's that all about?' Trump said. Then he called it a 'terrible sight to behold.'

'With that being said, I want to tell you that a lot of progress has been made by our country in the last two and a half years, ' Trump said, segueing into his tax event. 'Hard to believe we're already starting to think about our next election.'

Great buildings ravaged by fire: From Windsor Castle to York Minster The Windsor Castle fire of November 1992 A fire broke out at Windsor Castle on November 20, 1992, which caused extensive damage to the royal residence. The Berkshire blaze started at 11am in Queen Victoria's Private Chapel after a faulty spotlight ignited a curtain next to the altar. Within minutes the blaze had spread to St George's Hall next door, and the fire would go on to destroy 115 rooms, including nine State Rooms. Three hours after the blaze was first spotted 225 firemen from seven counties were battling the fire, using 36 pumps to discharge 1.5million gallons of water at the inferno's peak. The fire break at the other end of St George's Hall remained unbreached, so the Royal Library was fortunately left undamaged. A fire broke out at Windsor Castle on November 20, 1992, which caused extensive damage to the royal residence Staff worked to remove works of art from the Royal Collection from the path of the fire. According to the Royal Collection Trust: 'The Castle's Quadrangle was full of some of the finest examples of French 18th-century furniture, paintings by Van Dyck, Rubens and Gainsborough, Sèvres porcelain and other treasures of the Collection. 'Amazingly, only two works of art were lost in the fire - a rosewood sideboard and a very large painting by Sir William Beechey that couldn't be taken down from the wall in time. Luckily works of art had already been removed from many rooms in advance of rewiring work.' The Duke of York had said he he heard the fire alarm and roughly two or three minutes later he saw the smoke after leaving the room he was in, according to contemporary reports. Prince Andrew had joined a group removing valuable works of art from the castle to save them from destruction. The York Minster fire of 1984 Pictured: Aftermath of the York Minster fire of July 9, 1984 Early in the morning of July 9, 1984, York Minster's south transept was set ablaze, destroying the roof and causing £2.25million worth of damage. More than 100 firefighters confronted the church fire, taking two hours to bring it to heel. The cause of the fire is believed to have been a lightning bolt that struck the cathedral shortly after midnight. The blaze seriously damaged the cathedral's stonework, along with its famous Rose Window, and firefighters were left tackling embers on the floor after the roof collapsed at 4am. Minster staff and clergy busied themselves saving as many artefacts as possible before the fire was finally brought under control at around 5.24am. An investigation ruled out an electrical or gas fault, and arson was discounted due to roof's inaccessibility. Tests had found that the blaze was 'almost certainly' caused by a lightning strike but much of the evidence was destroyed in the fire. The building was restored in 1988 after masonry teams re-carved stonework above the building's rose window and arches. It was reported that the rose window, designed to celebrate the marriage of King Henry VII and Elizabeth of York, reached a temperature of 842F during the incident, cracking the glass in several places before it was restored. It was not the first time the building had caught ablaze. In the early hours of February 1, 1829, Jonathan Martin set the building on fire, melting the lead from the roof and cracking the building's limestone pillars. Late that afternoon the fire started dying out after roughly 230 feet of choir roof had collapsed. Non-conformist Martin, a former sailor from Northumberland, did not believe in formal liturgy, had published pamphlets condemning the clergy as 'vipers of Hell'. He was charged with setting the building on fire, but was found not guilty due to insanity, and died in a London asylum in 1838. Pictured: The roof of the South Transept of York Minster ablaze at the height of the fire. Minster staff and clergy busied themselves saving as many artefacts as possible before the fire was finally brought under control at around 5.24am The Great Fire of London St Paul’s Cathedral (pictured now) caught fire, with the lead roof melting and pouring into the street 'like a river' as the building collapsed On September 2, 1666, a fire broke out Thomas Farriner's bakery in Pudding Lane, close to London Bridge. The summer of 1666 had been unusually hot, and the city had not seen rain for several weeks, leaving wooden houses and buildings tinder dry. Once the fire had taken hold, 300 houses quickly collapsed and strong east winds fanned the flames from house to house, sweeping the blaze through London's winding narrow lanes, with houses positioned close together. In an attempt to flee the fire by boat, Londoners poured down to the River Thames and the city was overtaken by chaos. There was no fire brigade in London at the time, so residents themselves had to fight the fire with the help of local soldiers. They used buckets of water, water squirts and fire hooks, pulling down houses with hooks to make gaps or 'fire breaks', but the wind helped fan the fire across the created gaps. King Charles II had ordered that houses in the path of the fire should be pulled down - but the fire outstripped the hooked poles that were used to try and achieve this. By September 4 half of London had been overtaken by the blaze, and King Charles himself joined firefighters, handing them buckets of water in a desperate attempt to bring the blaze under control. Gunpowder was deployed to blow up houses that lay in the path's fire, but the sound of explosions triggered rumours of a French invasion, heightening the city's panic. St Paul’s Cathedral caught fire, with the lead roof melting and pouring into the street 'like a river' as the cathedral collapsed. The fire was eventually brought under control and extinguished by September 6, leaving just one fifth of London untouched. Almost every civic building had been destroyed, along with 13,000 private homes, 87 parish churches, The Royal Exchange, and Guildhall. Roughly 350,000 people lived in London just before the Great Fire, making the city one of the largest in Europe. A monument was erected in Pudding Lane, where the blaze broke out. By September 4 half of London had been overtaken by the blaze, and King Charles himself joined firefighters, handing them buckets of water in a desperate attempt to bring the blaze under control (pictured: An illustration from 1834) The Great Fire of Rome , 64AD The Great Fire of Rome, during the reign of Emperor Nero in 64AD, destroyed much of the city after the blaze began in the slums south of the aristocratic Palatine Hill. Strong winds fanned the fire north, scorching homes in its path, causing widespread panic during the inferno's three-day duration. Hundreds died in the conflagration, and thousands were left homeless. Three of the 14 districts were completely destroyed, and only four remained completely untouched. That Emperor Nero 'fiddled while the city burned' has become popular legend, but is not accurate. The Emperor was 35 miles away in Antium when the fire broke out and allowed his palace to be used as a shelter. And the fiddle had not yet been invented. Nero, who used the fire as an opportunity to rebuild the city in a more Greek style, blamed Christians for the fire, ordering the arrest, torture and execution of hundreds of the religion's faithful. Historian Tacitus said the fire was 'graver and more terrible than any other which had befallen this city.' Advertisement

'Art and history destroyed before our eyes': Witnesses share their horror as the Notre Dame Cathedral is engulfed in flames

Notre Dame Cathedral went up in flames on Monday in a roaring blaze that devastated the Parisian landmark, leaving the city, France, and the international community distraught.

Flames that began in the early evening burst through the roof of the centuries-old cathedral and engulfed the spire, which collapsed, quickly followed by the entire roof.

While a huge plume of smoke wafted across the city and ash fell over a large area, Parisians and tourists watched on, as others took to social media to express their sorrow.

'Centuries of art and history destroyed before our eyes. This building has stood since the Middle Ages. This is absolutely devastating,' one Twitter user wrote.

Later in the evening, those in the city gathered together to say prayers and sing hymns in front of the nearby Saint Julien Les Pauvres church as the massive blaze continued only a few hundred meters away.

Many were quietly singing an Ave Maria in Latin, including Stephane Seigneurie, 52, who said he has lived in Paris for the past 25 years.

'I come often, and go in even where there's no mass because it's an extraordinary place, entwined in the history of France,' he said. 'Politically, intellectually and spiritually, it's a symbol of France.'

Archbishop of Paris Michel Aupetit has invited priests across France to ring the bells of their churches in a call for prayers for Notre Dame.

'Paris is disfigured. The city will never be like it was before,' said Philippe, a communications worker in his mid-30s, who had biked over to the scene after being alerted of the fire by a friend.

'I'm a Parisian, my father was a Parisian, my grandfather as well - this was something we brought our sons to see,' he said. 'I won't be showing this to my son.'

'It's a tragedy,' he added. 'If you pray, now is the time to pray.'

'Basically the whole rooftop is gone. I see no hope for the building,' said witness Jacek Poltorak, watching the fire from a fifth-floor balcony two blocks from the southern facade of the cathedral, one of France's most visited places.

'Notre Dame is perhaps one of the most beautiful buildings I have ever set foot in, and watching it burn down is absolutely soul crushing,' read one Twitter post.

'Terrible seeing the Notre Dame in flames. Art and history turned to ashes. So glad no one has been hurt. Paris we are with you and will be there to see it restored. Shocking news,' another social media user said.

Others described the tragedy of never being able to see the Notre Dame as it was before the blaze.

'Sad I'll never get to see Notre Dame,' one Twitter user wrote. 'It's on my bucket list and now one of the historic landmarks is just gone! Thoughts go out to France'.

'It's finished, we'll never be able to see it again,' said Jerome Fautrey, a 37-year-old who had come to watch.

Buildings around were evacuated and nobody was injured, junior interior minister Laurent Nunez said at the scene, adding: 'It's too early to determine the causes of the fire.'

France 2 television reported that police were treating it as an accident.

'Everything is collapsing,' a police officer near the scene said as the entire roof of the cathedral continued to burn.

'Like all our compatriots, I am sad this evening to see this part of all of us burn,' President Emmanuel Macron tweeted.

'There are a lot of art works inside...it's a real tragedy,' Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said at the scene.

Questions for Paris fire brigade as Notre Dame inferno burns out of control for hours

Authorities have revealed they are unable to drop water on to Notre Dame to tame the blaze for fear it will ruin what is left of the 850-year-old cathedral as well as injuring people nearby.

The tactic was suggested by US President Donald Trump on Twitter but it hasn't been deployed because of the risks it could pose not only to the historic building but to any people nearby.

The French Interior Ministry tweeted to say that 400 firefighters have been mobilised to help tackle the blaze that is engulfing the cathedral.

In cases of intense fires, a water bomber jet - called a Canadair - can be deployed to drop large amounts of water.

Hundreds of comments have flooded in on the Pompiers du Paris Twitter page in support of the brave firefighters risking their lives to save Notre Dame.

French news site Le Monde, explains: 'A Canadair projects about six tonnes of water at high speed to the ground.

'The danger is significant of hurting one or more people around the building - which is why Canadair interventions are so infrequent in urban and peri-urban areas.

'Such an intervention could also significantly destroy the little remaining structure of the cathedral.'

If an accident happens while a Canadair is being used, the pilot may also face criminal charges.

Canadairs were used earlier this year in March when France experienced intense wildfires near Valdeblore in the Alpes-Maritimes.

They were also used in 2017 when France experienced intense wildfires that forced 10,000 people to evacuate their homes and campsites overnight.

"After Denver hired homeless people to shovel mulch and perform other day labor, more than 100 landed regular jobs","After Denver hired homeless people to shovel mulch and perform other day labor, more than 100 landed regular jobs",1.0,"Jeffrey Maes didn’t expect to live on the streets in his 50s. He had started several businesses, but he says the last one, a remodeling company, went south just as he was stretched thin on four properties.

He lost them all, he said, and ended up without a home — along with the realization that he was considered unemployable. But last year, he heard about a Denver-sponsored day-labor program that had helped friends get back on their feet.

After nearly four years of homelessness, Maes gave it a shot.

And on Tuesday, he spoke about how the Denver Day Works program has helped restore his pride — and helped him find a full-time job retrofitting lights at the city’s Central Library — as city officials announced the expansion of the program in the coming year. During a news conference at the library, Mayor Michael Hancock and others said the first-year numbers exceeded most of their goals.

In the first year after the program’s launch in November 2016, Denver Human Services says 284 people worked at least a day — with all but 10 sticking around longer — performing landscaping duties in parks, helping out at the Denver Elections Division, aiding public-works crews and other job assignments.

Of those participants, Maes was among 110 who found full-time work, with 15 landing permanent or project-based city jobs and the rest finding work with dozens of outside private and public employers.

“When you take a good person (who’s) down, broken, discouraged, and you give them an opportunity to be proud of their self — to stand up and do something for their self — that’s one of the greatest gifts anybody can give to anybody,” said Maes, 57. “And for that, I’d like to say thank you.”

Denver Day Works, run by contractor Bayaud Enterprises, has organized work crews three days a week. Next month, it will add a fourth day, with a fifth shift planned later in the year.

That will allow an increase in capacity that may reduce the waitlist that stretched to eight weeks at times in 2017. The city also plans to get more departments involved, offering varied work opportunities that might better attract women, minorities and the disabled as participants.

​The program, while robust, isn’t a panacea for Denver’s expansive homelessness problem, which has put pressure on city officials to address not only the need for job assistance but also housing and mental health services. But Hancock and others see the work program’s results as encouraging.

As part of Denver Day Works, Bayaud has helped connect participants with housing providers and, if eligible, public-assistance programs. It also supplies lunches for the workers, sometimes donated by restaurants.

At the end of each shift, they are paid wages of more than $12 an hour.

Hancock initiated Denver Day Works in late 2016 after reading a news report about a similar city day-labor program in Albuquerque. He budgeted $400,000 for the first year, about half of that for Bayaud’s administrative costs. That amount has increased to $696,300 for 2018.

The program’s success “shows what we’ve known all along — that people experiencing homelessness are no different” from other city residents, Hancock said. “They are hungry for the opportunity to work hard to achieve their personal dreams and to take their self-sufficiency in their own hands.”

Some of the figures and data from the program’s pilot year point to challenges, as highlighted in an outside evaluation by the University of Colorado Denver’s Center on Network Science.

A striking statistic: Just 57 of the 110 participants who were hired into regular jobs out of the program retained those jobs for more than 90 days. A researcher said this highlighted the need for the program to help participants adapt to those transitions.

“One of the things that we learned was how difficult it is for folks to transition from being homeless to … being expected to be at work five days a week, when you may not even have a place to put your stuff every day,” said Danielle Varda, an associate professor at CU Denver.

Maes was among three former Denver Day Works participants on hand Tuesday who for months have worked on a project crew that’s retrofitting all of the Central Library’s fluorescent lights with LEDs.

Another participant, Regina Pizarro, 46, teared up while talking about her experience in the day-labor program. She now has a job providing customer service at a call center, and she credits Denver Day Works for putting her on that path.

“It didn’t matter whether I was shoveling mulch, working at Denver Votes — it didn’t matter what I was doing, because I had a job,” she said, adding about her Bayaud supervisors: “They have a lot of compassion and understanding. They don’t look down on us because we’ve been on the streets.”",https://www.denverpost.com/2018/01/16/denver-day-works-program-homeless-jobs/

John Cena Has Granted Over 600 Make a Wish Foundation Wishes—More Than Any Celebrity in History

From “scrawny” kid who was bullied to a record-breaking 16-time WWE World Champion to bonafide movie star — it seems there’s nothing John Cena can’t and won’t do.

Now, Cena can add prolific wish-granter to his flourishing list of accomplishments. The wrestler turned actor has helped make the dreams of more than 600 kids come true for Make-A-Wish, a non-profit organization that helps grant life-changing wishes for children fighting critical illnesses.

Though he discovered it by accident when he was still a rookie in the WWE in 2002.

“My first Make-A-Wish, I was kind of shuffled — it wasn’t for me, I think the person wanted to meet another superstar,” Cena, 42, tells PEOPLE in this week’s issue. “But the WWE does a great job of like, ‘Hey, there’s a Make-A-Wish kid in this room. Can you come say hello?’ So, a bunch of people are shuttled in to say hello to a young fan of WWE.”

“So, we’re shuttled in and said my hellos and took my pictures and then left. And they’re like, ‘Thank you, Make-A-Wish thanks you.’ I was like, ‘What is Make-A-Wish?’” Cena continued.

Once the Trainwreck star was made aware of what the foundation stood for, he went out of his way to prioritize charity work above all else in the future.

“I said, ‘If you ever need me for this ever, I don’t care what I’m doing, I will drop what I’m doing and be involved because I think that’s the coolest thing,’” Cena explained. “We’ve all experienced that joy of giving a gift for the holidays where you just nail it — that’s the same gift I get in giving back to people’s lives, in being able to give them wonderful emotional moments.”

Last December, the wrestler and Hailee Steinfeld teamed up with Make-A-Wish to light up the Empire State Building yellow in honor of their movie Bumblebee, as well as to commemorate his dedication to brightening children’s lives.

In his upcoming movie Playing with Fire, Cena plays a smokejumper (specialized firefighter) named Jake Carson, who leads a small team of men in a fire depot based in Redding, California. Despite their everyday challenges at work, he and his colleagues are put to the ultimate test when they assume responsibility of three orphaned siblings during a heavy storm in the woods.

Amidst the tragic blazes that are causing millions of Californians to evacuate their homes, Cena pledged $500,000 to the Los Angeles Fire Department Foundation and the California Fire Foundation, charities chosen by Paramount Pictures, the studio behind Playing with Fire.

“It’s really special that we were able to take a movie and tie it into a charity,” the WWE champion said. “We’ve had numerous instances where we can tie relevance and awareness around first responders to get possibly more funding for their departments around a movie that’s a family comedy kind of loosely based on firefighters.”

Not only does the actor hold the privilege of most wishes granted by a single individual, but he also happens to be the most requested celebrity for the foundation, according to Today. Not many others make it past 300 wishes.

“The fact that I essentially play dress up for a living and can still be a force in providing hope and happiness for children and families? That’s extra, extra special,” Cena tells PEOPLE. “You can learn from any and every situation. I learned from every single child I meet and their families as well. It’s incredibly rewarding.”

And with every wish, the Blockers star commits to it.

“If you were given one wish, what would you do with it? I don’t know if ‘Hang out with John Cena’ would be at the top of my list,” Cena says. “But the fact that that is on someone’s list is the coolest thing. So, I approach it with that attitude — like this is fantastic, let’s make this wonderful.”",https://people.com/movies/john-cena-has-granted-over-600-make-a-wish-foundation-wishes-more-than-any-celebrity-in-history/

Even as states across the country have legalized marijuana, potentially opening the door to a multibillion dollar industry, the impact of marijuana criminalization is still being felt by people — mostly black and Hispanic — whose records are marked by low-level convictions related to the drug.

But on Wednesday, New York began the process of expunging many of those records, as part of a new state law to reduce penalties associated with marijuana-related crimes, a spokesman for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo confirmed.

“For too long communities of color have been disproportionately impacted by laws governing marijuana and have suffered the lifelong consequences of an unfair marijuana conviction,” Mr. Cuomo said in a statement.

Under the new law, which was passed in June and took effect on Wednesday, about 160,000 people with marijuana convictions in the state will have those convictions cleared from their record, according to a spokeswoman for the State Division of Criminal Justice Services .",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/28/nyregion/marijuana-records-new-york-city.html?emc=rss&partner=rss
Arkansas city paying homeless $9.25 an hour to collect trash,Arkansas city paying homeless $9.25 an hour to collect trash,1.0,"Arkansas has been paying homeless people $9.25 an hour — two bucks more than the federal minimum wage — to pick up trash around its state capital.

And the program in Little Rock, dubbed Bridge to Work, has been so successful since it began in April that the city’s mayor, Frank Scott Jr., is planning to extend it an additional year, according to 12 News Now.

“We’re super excited about what has gone on, and we hope to be able to keep the momentum going,” said associate pastor Paul Atkins of the Canvas Community Church, which runs the program, the news outlet reported.

“We want to work with them on their next step,” Atkins said during a board meeting last month. “There are a lot of barriers that our people experience to go from homelessness and panhandling to full-time work. There’s a lot of steps in between.”

The Bridge to Work program originally was planned to last just six months but will be extended to go through the end of September 2020, according to the site.

According to Atkins, 380 people joined the work crews, with some joining more than once.

A total of 130 sites have been cleaned, 2,056 bags filled with trash and 1,821 hours worked since the program started, the news outlet reported.

An Indian couple has been buying land near a tiger reserve and letting the forest grow back,An Indian couple has been buying land adjacent to a tiger reserve just to let the forest expand.,1.0,"It was his love for nature and wildlife that led Aditya Singh to quit his Indian civil services job, leave his well-appointed house in Delhi and settle in a remote corner of Rajasthan, abutting the famous Ranthambore Tiger Reserve, in 1998. Over the last 20 years, Singh has been buying tracts of land adjacent to Ranthambore and simply letting the forest grow back.

After shifting to Sawai Madhopur, a small city near Ranthambore tiger reserve (RTR), Singh took up photography. His wife Poonam Singh and he opened a tourist resort there to earn their living. Unlike many tourism establishments that want unrestricted access to the wild areas, they slowly started buying land parcels adjacent to each other just outside RTR’s boundary.

“The area is called Bhadlav. I had first gone to this area soon after settling in Ranthambore along with a BBC filmmaker. This area adjacent to the boundary of the Ranthambore reserve was visited by predators like tigers who used to come for prey. As a result, farmers were selling their land,” said Singh.

Poonam remembers how it was love at first sight for her when she visited Ranthambore with Aditya. “My first sighting was a tigress with three cubs on a hill. It was magical. At the end of the trip, I just asked him if we can move to Ranthambore. He wanted it, too, and within months we moved. As far as this land is concerned, it was a dream that we both saw and achieved together to have our own area of wilderness,” she says. Poonam, an artist by profession, managed the resort with Aditya for twenty years until they closed it down in 2019.

They now own about 35 acres of land in Bhadlav, another five acres a few hundred metres away and a strip of land connecting the two.

“I just bought this and did nothing to it except removing the invasive species. We allowed the land to recover and now after 20 years it has become a lush green patch of forest which is frequently visited by all kind of animals, including tigers, leopards and wild boars, throughout the year,” said Singh.

In an aerial shot he had captured, Singh points to their land parcel—a lush green expanse compared to the barren land of the Ranthambore tiger reserve with which his landholding shares the boundary. He has also created several water holes in the landholding to ensure that the wild animals get water even during summers.

Aditya Singh An aerial view of the land transformed by the Singhs.

As a result, the pressure of predators like tigers from RTR venturing into fields of farmers has gone down. “It is simply because the animals understand that in this patch of the forest they get prey, water and safe shelter without any disturbance,” chuckled Singh.

At present, India has 50 tiger reserves. Ranthambore is among the country’s biggest and most famous tiger reserves, with an estimated population of about 60 tigers.

Singh admitted that he is often subjected to questions for not carrying out any project on his land which is now well worth over Rs1 crore ($140,000) despite getting so many proposals.

“Money was never the consideration. It is just about my love for nature and wildlife. Instead, these days I am getting queries from people across India who want to replicate a similar model in their state,” he said.

MAYANK AGGARWAL Aditya Singh

The Singhs are not done with this dream. Singh says he wants to buy more land adjacent to his fields, especially the agriculture field next to his land and inspire others in the area to follow suit.

The couple’s side project, a new home and homestay that’s in progress, is going to run on solar and wind power where too they are creating two small water holes on the fence of the house so that thirsty animals can get water during summers.

Leonardo DiCaprio raises $100 million to fight climate change,Leonardo DiCaprio raises $100 million to fight climate change,1.0,"The actor has always been passionate about fighting climate change (Picture: Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic)

Leonardo DiCaprio has proved there’s nothing he can’t do by raising a whopping $100 million (£79 million) to fight climate change.

He’s a good egg all round.

The Titanic actor, who founded the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation to increase awareness about climate change, wrote in a statement: ‘When I founded LDF 20 years ago, I did so based on the simple idea that we could make a real difference by directly funding some of the most effective environmental projects.

‘Whether it be individuals, grassroots movements or major nonprofits, we wanted to focus on getting critical funding to those who could have the greatest impact.

‘We are extremely proud to celebrate 20 years of this model. Since 1998, we have supported over 200 projects on every continent and in every ocean from habitat and species conservation, renewable energy, climate change, indigenous rights, and more.

‘I am pleased to announce $11 million (£8.6 million) in new grants across our six program areas, bringing the total financial impact of LDF to over $100 million (£79 million).’

In 2016 he produced and starred in documentary Before The Flood, which focuses on the effects of climate change (Picture: Tibrina Hobson/WireImage)

Could we love him any more?

It’s safe to say Leo’s had his fair share of trouble with awards (we won’t mention the Oscar saga), and his track record for environmental awards isn’t much better, as he was slammed in 2016 for jetting off on a private jet to receive one.

Bit awks.

A rep for DiCaprio told US Weekly: ‘He was asked to speak at both Riverkeeper and amfAR events, but the only way to attend the two fundraisers was to hitch a ride with flights that were already planned.

‘Leo helped both events raise millions, donated his own funds, auctioned off his house and had speaking roles in both programs.’

Despite the criticism, Leo’s stood firm in his efforts to address climate change, with it being the focus of his speech at the Oscars.

He pointed out: ‘Climate change is real. It is happening right now. It is the most urgent threat facing our entire species. We need to work together to stop procrastinating…Let us not take this planet for granted. I do not take tonight for granted.’

Indiana school superintendent arrested for allegedly using own insurance to help sick student,"School superintendent arrested for allegedly using own insurance to help sick student will only get small fine, keep job.",1.0,"The superintendent of an Indiana school district was arrested and faces fraud charges for allegedly using her son’s name to help a sick student receive medical treatment.

Casey Smitherman, the superintendent of Elwood Community School Corporation, was charged with insurance fraud, identity deception, insurance application fraud and official misconduct, court documents show.

Police in Elwood, Indiana, said they received a tip that Smitherman took a 15-year-old student to urgent care on Jan. 9 after the teenager missed school because he had a sore throat, according to a probable cause affidavit.

Casey Smitherman, the superintendent of Elwood Community Schools in Indiana, was booked on charges of insurance fraud, identity deception and official misconduct on Jan. 23, 2019. Madison County Sheriff's Department

Madison County Prosecutor Rodney Cummings told NBC News that Smitherman took the student to one urgent care location but was denied because she is not his guardian. That’s when Smitherman took the student to St. Vincent Med in Elwood and used her insurance to have the student evaluated under her son’s name, Cummings said.

Smitherman told police that she was worried about the student when he did not show up for school and she went by his house and saw that he was ill, according to the affidavit. She said after leaving urgent care she went to a CVS Pharmacy to have a prescription filled for Amoxicillin, again using her insurance and son’s name.

Smitherman said that she did not contact child welfare authorities because she feared the student would be placed in a foster home. Smitherman also said that she has helped the student in the past by buying clothes for him and cleaning his home, the affidavit states.

Cummings said the student does not live at the home with his parents, and is under the care of a relative.

Authorities contacted the student who told them that he knew it was “bad” to be in possession of someone else’s prescription so he tore the label off the pill bottle.

Smitherman was arrested and released after posting a $500 cash bond, according to court records. A court date has not yet been set, but Smitherman will most likely end up paying a fine and possibly doing community service, Cummings said.

Elwood Community School Corporation said in a statement Thursday that Smitherman made an ""unfortunate mistake"" and she has their support.

""We understand that it was out of concern for this child’s welfare. We know she understands what she did was wrong, but she continues to have our support,"" the district said in a statement to The Herald Bulletin.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/school-superintendent-arrested-allegedly-using-own-insurance-help-sick-student-n962511
North Dakota quietly decriminalized marijuana,North Dakota quietly decriminalized marijuana,1.0,"North Dakota quietly decriminalized marijuana earlier this month, making it the 25th state to do so.

As the news outlet Marijuana Moment and the advocacy group NORML reported, Republican Gov. Doug Burgum signed a bill decriminalizing marijuana last week — but the issue got little to no attention from his office or news media. The law makes it so first-time possession of up to half an ounce of marijuana is no longer a criminal misdemeanor that carries the potential for jail time, but instead is an infraction that only carries a fine.

This is different from marijuana legalization. Under decriminalization, possession of small amounts of pot no longer carries jail or prison time but can continue to carry a fine, and possession of larger amounts, repeat offenses, and sales or trafficking can still result in harsher sentences. Under legalization, penalties for marijuana possession are completely removed, and sales are typically allowed.

Some opponents of legalization favor decriminalization as a step toward peeling back America’s harsh drug and criminal justice policies. They see “tough on crime” policies as too punitive and costly, but they don’t want to resort to full legalization, which they fear would make pot too accessible in the US and allow big corporations to sell and market the drug irresponsibly.

The concern for legalization advocates is that decriminalization keeps the ban on selling marijuana, which means users wouldn’t have a legal source for the drug, and criminal organizations would therefore still have a source of revenue that they can use for violent operations around the world. The fines, while less punitive than arrests or prison time, can also cause problems, since they’re often applied in a racially disparate manner.

Ten states and Washington, DC, have legalized marijuana, although DC and Vermont don’t allow sales. Fifteen additional states, now including North Dakota, have only decriminalized.

North Dakota voters rejected a marijuana legalization ballot initiative last year, but activists reportedly will try again in 2020.

Supporters of legalization argue that it eliminates the harms of marijuana prohibition: the hundreds of thousands of arrests around the US, the racial disparities behind those arrests, and the billions of dollars that flow from the black market for illicit marijuana to drug cartels that then use the money for violent operations around the world. All of this, legalization advocates say, will outweigh any of the potential downsides — such as increased cannabis use — that might come with legalization.

Opponents, meanwhile, claim that legalization will enable a huge marijuana industry that will market the drug irresponsibly. They point to America’s experiences with the alcohol and tobacco industries in particular, which have built their financial empires in large part on some of the heaviest consumers of their products. This could result in far more people using pot, even if it leads to negative health consequences.

For now, legalization is not reality in North Dakota. But decriminalization is.

In a statement released by the band, they said they felt 'overwhelmed' by the wild fires which are sweeping through the country.

'The resulting destruction and devastating effects on all residents, animals, the environment and the incredible land in Australia is truly heartbreaking,' they said.

Then they urged others to 'join us' to 'do whatever' they could to assist while providing information and links to the respective firefighting organisations.

'Overwhelmed' Metallica released a statement to Instagram on Wednesday where they said they were 'overwhelmed' by the devastation in Australia and urged fans to 'join' them by donating to NSWRFS and CFAVic

Fans overwhelming took to social media to thank the band.

'You are truly the best! God bless you all' one woman commented.

'Absolutely amazing guys!! Thank you from Australia! Can’t wait for you guys to come back,' a man commented.

Another fan was quick to suggest further ways the band could could help raise funds for bushfire relief charities in Australia.

Cancelled: The donation comes three months after Metallica was 'devastated' to indefinitely postponed the Australian and New Zealand leg of their World Wired Tour after lead singer James Hetfield, 56, re-entered rehab to treat an 'addiction'

'Ya'll should do a fundraiser concert with a bunch of other rock bands like Live AID but you donate funds to Australians affected by the fires,' they wrote.

Other users quickly suggested U2, Pink and Guns N' Roses might be persuaded to join in, if Metallica did go ahead and plan a aid relief style concert.

The donation comes three months after the band was 'devastated' to indefinitely postpone the Australian and New Zealand leg of their World Wired Tour after lead singer James Hetfield, 56, re-entered rehab to treat an 'addiction'.

The catastrophic bushfire season in Australia has so far claimed at least 25 lives, destroyed 2,000 homes and killed close to a billion animals.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7863345/Heavy-metal-band-Metallica-donates-750-000-firefighters-Australia.html
This Brooklyn Landlord Just Canceled Rent for Hundreds of Tenants,"NYC landlord waiving April rent for his 200-300 tenants because of Coronavirus. “I told them just to look out for your neighbor and make sure that everyone has food on their table,"" he said. [NYT]",1.0,"It is too soon to get an accurate gauge of how many renters withheld their April rent and what the fallout would be for landlords.

But Mr. Salerno said in an interview on Thursday that he did not care about losing his rental income in April, nor did he care to calculate the amount that he would not be collecting from his 80 apartments. He said he had about 200 to 300 tenants in total.

He is likely forgoing hundreds of thousands of dollars in income by canceling April rent.

His only interest, he said, was in alleviating stress for his renters, even those who were still employed and now working from home.

“My concern is everyone’s health,” said Mr. Salerno, 59, whose rent gesture was first reported by the local news site Greenpointers.com. “I told them just to look out for your neighbor and make sure that everyone has food on their table.”

Mr. Salerno said a handful of his tenants messaged him last month saying that they could not afford rent. Three renters from Ireland packed up a few belongings and moved back home, he said.

When Mr. Gentile spotted the sign last week, he said he was surprised but not shocked. For the nearly four years Mr. Gentile has lived in the apartment, Mr. Salerno has been a model landlord.

Emergencies are fixed almost immediately, he said, such as a water leak in Mr. Gentile’s ceiling that was fixed, patched and painted within several hours.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/nyregion/coronavirus-nyc-landlord-mario-salerno.html#click=https://t.co/fUY1AG7Y8t
New HIV diagnoses in gay and bisexual men at their lowest in 20 years,New HIV diagnoses in gay and bisexual men at their lowest in 20 years,1.0,"The number of gay and bisexual men ( GBM ) with newly diagnosed HIV fell to the lowest point in 20 years, according to a new report from Public Health England ( PHE ) published today.

The report shows there were 1,700 new HIV diagnoses in GBM in 2019 compared to 1,500 in 2000.

Overall, the number of people with a new HIV diagnoses fell by 10% (from 4,580 in 2018 to 4,139 in 2019). There was also a 34% decline from a peak of 6,312 new diagnoses in 2014.

There were 1,700 new HIV diagnoses in gay and bisexual men ( GBM ) in 2019 compared to around 1,600 cases in heterosexual adults. This is the lowest number of new HIV diagnoses in GBM since the year 2000 (1,500) and since 1998 in heterosexual adults (1,600).

HIV transmission in GBM has fallen by 80%; newly acquired HIV infections fell from an estimated peak of 2,700 cases in 2011 to an estimated 540 in 2019 (see background information).

While the proportion of people diagnosed late remained high at 42%, the overall number decreased from around 1,900 in 2015 to 1,300 in 2019. People diagnosed late in 2019 had an eight-fold risk of death compared to those diagnosed promptly.

The decline in HIV transmission in GBM can be directly linked to the increase in combination prevention, including:

the use of condoms

pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP )

frequent HIV testing in a wide range of settings

starting antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) as soon as possible after diagnosis

Treatment is now so effective that 97% of people receiving ART have undetectable levels of virus, which means it is impossible to pass the virus on, even if having sex without condoms. Undetectable = untransmittable (U=U).

HIV testing is vital for preventing HIV -related illness and death and to achieve the goal of ending HIV transmission in the UK by 2030. The UK continues to meet the United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS (UNAIDS) 90-90-90 targets for the third consecutive year – however, there are opportunities to improve uptake of testing and support those testing positive to continue their treatment.

Almost 300,000 people declined to have an HIV test when they attended a specialist sexual health service. Black African heterosexual women attendees were more likely to decline a test than Black African heterosexual men (20% versus 9% declined testing) but less likely than heterosexual women and men overall (25% versus 13%). More focused conversations on HIV , testing, prevention and treatment in schools and clinical settings can help to combat high rates of declined tests.

By comparison, only 4% of GBM attending specialist sexual health services declined an HIV test – this is the group in which greatest declines in HIV transmission have been achieved.

Dr Valerie Delpech, Head of HIV Surveillance at PHE , said:

In the UK, we have made great progress towards eliminating HIV transmission by 2030. Frequent HIV testing, the offer of PrEP among those most at risk of HIV , together with prompt treatment among those diagnosed, remain key to ending HIV transmission by 2030. Further progress can only be achieved if we also address the inequalities in reducing HIV transmission that exist around sexuality, ethnicity and geography.

The most common way of getting HIV in the UK is through sex with a person who is unaware of their HIV infection.

You can protect yourself from HIV by consistent and correct condom use with new and casual partners, by using PrEP , or if your partner is on treatment and is undetectable if they are living with HIV . Correct and consistent condom use will also stop you getting or transmitting other sexually transmitted diseases ( STIs ).

People can get tested through free tests available from sexual health clinics, GP surgeries, as well as through a self-sampling service or by using a self-testing kit.

Background information

Those at risk of HIV and STIs can still access services through sexual health clinics during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many clinics offer online testing, which means people can order tests using clinic websites, take them in the privacy of their own home, return by post and receive results via text, phone call or post.",https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-hiv-diagnoses-in-gay-and-bisexual-men-at-their-lowest-in-20-years
Grocery store inadvertently open on Family Day – Kingston News,"TIL a grocery store in Canada was left unlocked and unattended on a national holiday. The only thing taken was cherry tomatoes, for which a person left $5 at the checkout. The person actually overpaid.",1.0,"Despite having scheduled to be closed on Family Day, one downtown grocery store had ‘customers’ anyway when the doors to the business were inadvertently open during the holiday.

On Monday, Feb. 18, 2019, the Food Basics location on Barrack Street was meant to be closed for the provincial holiday. However, with almost all of the grocery stores in the area closed for the day, those seeking a few staples or the fixings for dinner were happy enough to find the doors of the downtown grocer open – that is, until they went inside.

With no staff scheduled for the day, the open doors of the business meant members of the public were able to enter, but not actually purchase any items. Nonetheless, people walked around inside the store, some seemingly unaware of the situation, while others stood out front trying to figure out what was going on.

“I was standing there trying to decide what to do, and a guy comes out of the store with two packages of cherry tomatoes,” said one eyewitness who asked to remain anonymous.

“So I asked ‘Hey, buddy! You just taking some tomatoes?’ He said ‘I left $5 on the counter.’”

The witness then chose to contact Kingston Police to let them know what was going on.

According to Kingston Police, officers did attend the Food Basics location at approximately 4:25 p.m. on Family Day. Officers got in contact with a store manager, who found that nothing was damaged. The business indicated they would review store security footage and contact police if it appeared as though anything substantial was stolen.

“I looks as though there was no damage, and the situation wasn’t out of control or anything,” said Const. Ashley Gutheinz, media relations officer for Kingston Police.

“The doors were open, and we don’t know… what’s to blame for that, but it appears that the store manager indicated nothing was seriously damaged or stolen.”",https://www.kingstonist.com/grocery-store-inadvertently-open-on-family-day/
Jeffrey Epstein mansion sells for $51m with abused women to receive the money,Jeffrey Epstein mansion sells for $51m with abused women to receive the money,1.0,"Jeffrey Epstein's New York mansion has been sold more than a year after he died in prison.

The property was sold for $51m, and the funds generated from the sale will go to his victims.

The mansion is the most expensive of Mr Epstein's properties, whose portfolio included a ranch in New Mexico, two private islands, and a waterfront mansion in Palm Beach.

The sale of the mansion was confirmed on Wednesday.

Last month, the administrator for the Epstein Victims' Compensation Program, Jordy Feldman, said claim payouts would be suspended because the fund ran out of money. The newly sold mansion will replenish the victims fund's coffers.

Ms Feldman said she will lift the claim suspension thanks to the influx of money.

""We are eager to resume issuing compensation offers as soon as possible,"" Ms Feldman told CNN. ""Once we have more information about the amount of funds that will be made available to the Program and when, I will decide when we can lift the suspension and get back to full Program operations.""

The fate of the property was in limbo after US Virgin Islands Attorney General Denise George moved to add Epstein's lawyers, who also are co-executors of his estate, as co-conspirators to a civil case.

The lawyers - Darren Indyke and Richard Kahn - took the unusual move of asking the Superior Court of the Virgin Islands to accept Ms George's motion, suggesting the estate is confident the state will toss out the effort to include the co-executors in the civil complaint.

“The proposed claims are part of the Government’s concerted effort to frustrate the Co-Executors’ ongoing orderly administration of the Epstein Estate, which recent efforts include not only this Motion, but also the Government’s baseless emergency motion in the Probate Court to freeze all Estate assets,” Attorney Christopher Kroblin wrote in a filing obtained by The Miami Herald.

Ms George has claimed that Mr Indyke and Mr Kahn are ""captains"" of a criminal enterprise in which they forced Epstein's American victims to marry his foreign victims as part of an immigration fraud scheme.

The men have denied that allegation.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/jeffrey-epstein-mansion-price-sale-b1815846.html
"Minnesota Will Pay Homeowners to Replace Lawns with Bee-Friendly Wildflowers, Clover and Native Grasses","Minnesota Will Pay Homeowners to Replace Lawns with Bee-Friendly Wildflowers, Clover and Native Grasses",1.0,"January 29, 2020 at 5:09 am









Minnesota is asking homeowners to turn their lawns into prairie to help bring back the bees











Minnesota just allocated nearly a million dollars in incentives for people to transform their lawns into bee-friendly wildflowers, clover and native grasses.

The state is asking citizens to stop spraying herbicide, stop mowing so often, and let their lawns re-wild into a more natural state.

The goal is to provide “food sources for pollinators of all kinds, but will specifically aim at saving the rusty patched bumblebee, a fat and fuzzy species on the brink of extinction that seems to be making its final stand in the cities of the Upper Midwest,” the Star Tribune reports.

Research has shown bumblebees are particularly important to the region, as they vibrate at frequency that unlocks pollen other insects can’t reach.

The loss of native prairies and forests across the country has made pollinators more dependent on urban and suburban lawn flowers, says James Wolfin, a bee habitat researcher at University of Minnesota.

His research has focused on “bee lawns” – grassy yards interspersed with small flowers such as Dutch white clover, creeping thyme, self heal, ground plum and dandelions.



The flowers make excellent food source for bees, while being cheap to plant and easy maintain.

“A pound of Dutch white clover is about $7 and it grows low enough that people wouldn’t even have to change the way they mow their lawn,” Wolfin

told the Star Tribune.

Around 55 of Minnesota’s 350 bee species depend on white clover alone, he notes.

“So just by not treating white clover like a weed and letting it grow in a yard provides a really powerful resource for nearly 20% of the bee species in the state,” Wolfin said.

The program is set to begin in spring of 2020.

Citizens living in rusty patch bumblebee zones are eligible for grants up to $500, while people living in zones of secondary and tertiary importance to bees are eligible for $350 and $150 respectively.

Considering a 1-pound bag of clover seeds costs as little as $10, and spreads “like a weed,” that should be plenty to cover it.

In fact, letting your lawn go to the bees is so easy, those of us living outside Minnesota might want to consider joining in the effort!

Senate Decriminalizes Marijuana Use In New York State,NYS passes bill to decriminalize marijuana possession and expunge criminal records,1.0,"(Albany, NY) The Senate today passed legislation that will address the racial disparities that are present in New York’s antiquated marijuana drug laws. New York’s existing marijuana laws disproportionately affect the African American and Latinx communities. This monumental legislation will decriminalize small amounts of marijuana and establish procedures for record expungements for both past and future convictions.

“Communities of color have borne the brunt of New York State’s marijuana drug laws. Our justice system directly reflects who we are as a society and that is why the Senate Majority is taking action to fix this broken system,” Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins said. “This legislation is marking a momentous first step in addressing the racial disparities caused by the war on drugs. The Senate Majority continues to move forward on full legalization and I thank Senator Jamaal Bailey for his leadership on this issue.”

Bill Sponsor, Senator Jamaal Bailey said, “In New York State, people of color are disproportionately arrested for marijuana possession. The misdemeanor charge for public view of marijuana possession gives those people convicted a criminal record that will follow them throughout their lives, potentially limiting their access to housing, access to education, affecting their ability to obtain employment, all leading to a potential inability to provide for their families. While this legislation falls short of the goal of legalization of adult-use cannabis, the ability to create a mechanism for expungement, both retroactively and forward-looking, is a step in the right direction in finally ending the heavy-handed war on drugs that has decimated communities of color.”

African-American and Latinx individuals are arrested at higher rates for misdemeanor marijuana possessions. In New York City, African-Americans are eight times more likely to be arrested on low-level marijuana charges and Latinx people are arrested at five times more. The racial disparities for arrests are wider for cities in Upstate, NY. According to the New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU), African Americans living in Schenectady County are 74 times more likely to be arrested on a marijuana charge.

House passes ‘Tiger King’ bill to ban private ownership of big cats,House passes ‘Tiger King’ bill to ban private ownership of big cats,1.0,"The House on Thursday passed a bill that could prevent the emergence of another “Tiger King.”

Joe Exotic, the other nickname for “Tiger King” Joseph Maldonado-Passage for whom the infamous Netflix docuseries is named, is in prison serving a 22-year sentence for wildlife crimes and a murder-for-hire scheme. But some in Congress want to make sure no one else can ever allow the public to interact with big cats like the “Tiger King” did at the former Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park in Oklahoma.

[How ‘Tiger King’ wooed Congress before it was ‘Tiger King’]

The House in a 272-114 vote Thursday passed legislation known as the Big Cat Public Safety Act, which would ban private ownership of big cats such as tigers, lions, leopards, cheetahs, jaguars or cougars. The measure would make it illegal for someone to breed or own big cats without an animal exhibition license from the U.S. Department of Agriculture but would grandfather in current owners if they register with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and abide by federal regulations.

The bill’s actual impact on the “Tiger King” — had he not got into financial and legal trouble that forced him to transfer ownership of his zoo to Jeff Lowe and ultimately led to his imprisonment — would have been minimal. Maldonado-Passage had an exhibitor license so he could have remained in operation but would have had to stop his controversial practice of cub petting, as the bill would ban licensed exhibitors from allowing visitors to interact with big cats. USDA suspended the zoo’s license this summer, and shortly after, Lowe announced he would permanently close operations, an action court battles had already set in motion.",https://www.rollcall.com/2020/12/03/house-passes-tiger-king-bill-to-ban-private-ownership-of-big-cats/
Nasa ‘human computer’ Katherine Johnson celebrates 100th birthday,"In 1961, her calculations put the first American in space. Today, Katherine Johnson is celebrating her 100th birthday",1.0,"Nasa has joined the 100th birthday celebrations for Katherine Johnson, an African-American “human computer” who overcame racial and gender discrimination, to become a crucial part of the US’s space programme.

The contribution of Ms Johnson and two of her black colleagues, Mary Jackson and Dorothy Vaughan, who worked at Nasa’s Langley Research Centre located in Hampton, Virginia, was featured in the 2016 movie Hidden Figures, directed by Theodore Melfi. In the movie, Ms Johnson was portrayed by actress Taraji Henson.

“Wishing a #happybirthday to Katherine G Johnson on her 100th birthday today,” Nasa’s official history office wrote in a tweet. “She worked at @NASA_Langley as a human computer starting in 1953. Her calculations were critical to our early human spaceflight programme (you’ve probably seen that in the movies).”

Ms Johnson, who was born in 1918 in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, was the youngster of four children and showed a talent for mathematics and calculations at an early age. Because public education for black children was not available behind the 8th grade, her parents arranged for her to attend high school on the campus of what is now West Virginia State University.

After graduating high school at the age of 14, she entered the historically black college where she studied maths and science. Among her tutors was the pioneering mathematician Angie Turner King. Ms Johnson was eventually joined the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics, which would became Nasa.

“It is my hope that the students who pass by [this statue] every day will be reminded of Katherine’s legacy and will be inspired to keep their passion for knowledge alive,” he said.

“Every one of our female leaders in West Virginia are an epitome of strength...and advancements in their fields. They serve as inspiring role models for the next generation, and that is due in great part to the women who broke ground in generations past.”

A Florida Lottery news release said Friday that 20-year-old Shane Missler, of Port Richey, had claimed the jackpot from the multistate game's Jan. 5 drawing. They say he chose to receive his winnings in a one-time, lump-sum payment of $281,874,999.

""I'm only 20, but I hope to use it to pursue a variety of passions, help my family and do some good for humanity,"" he said in a statement.

The winning numbers to claim the nation's 10th-largest jackpot were 28-30-39-59-70 with a Mega Ball of 10.

The winning ticket was bought at a 7-Eleven in Port Richey. The retailer will receive a $100,000 bonus.

The Tampa Bay Times reported that Missler was grinning widely and clutching a yellow envelope when he turned in his ticket Friday at Florida Lottery headquarters in Tallahassee. His father and his lawyer came with him. They released a statement on his behalf.

""If there is one thing I have learned thus far in my short time on this earth it is that those who maintain a positive mindset and stay true to themselves get rewarded,"" Missler said in the statement. ""I look forward to the future.""

Lottery officials said the money will be paid to a trust, set up with Missler as the managing member, called ""Secret 007, LLC.""

""Although I'm young, I've had a crash course this week in financial management and I feel so fortunate to have this incredible wealth and team behind me,"" said Missler, who also told the Times that he plans to move out of Port Richey. ""I intend to take care of my family, have some fun along the way and cement a path for financial success so that I can leave a legacy far into the future.""",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/florida-20-year-old-wins-451-million-mega-millions-jackpot-n837386

This High Schooler Invented Color-Changing Sutures to Detect Infection,"This High Schooler Invented Color-Changing Sutures to Detect Infection - After winning a state science fair and becoming a finalist in a national competition, Dasia Taylor now has her sights set on a patent",1.0,"Dasia Taylor has juiced about three dozen beets in the last 18 months. The root vegetables, she’s found, provide the perfect dye for her invention: suture thread that changes color, from bright red to dark purple, when a surgical wound becomes infected.

The 17-year-old student at Iowa City West High School in Iowa City, Iowa, began working on the project in October 2019, after her chemistry teacher shared information about state-wide science fairs with the class. As she developed her sutures, she nabbed awards at several regional science fairs, before advancing to the national stage. This January, Taylor was named one of 40 finalists in the Regeneron Science Talent Search, the country’s oldest and most prestigious science and math competition for high school seniors.

As any science fair veteran knows, at the core of a successful project is a problem in need of solving. Taylor had read about sutures coated with a conductive material that can sense the status of a wound by changes in electrical resistance, and relay that information to the smartphones or computers of patients and doctors. While these “smart” sutures could help in the United States, the expensive tool might be less applicable to people in developing countries, where internet access and mobile technology is sometimes lacking. And yet the need is there; on average, 11 percent of surgical wounds develop an infection in low- and middle-incoming countries, according to the World Health Organization, compared to between 2 and 4 percent of surgeries in the U.S.

Infections after Cesarean sections particularly caught Taylor’s attention. In some African nations, up to 20 percent of women who give birth by C-section then develop surgical site infections. Research has also shown that health centers in Sierra Leone, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Burundi have similar or lower rates of infection, at between 2 and 10 percent, following C-sections than the U.S., where rates range from 8 to 10 percent.

But smartphone access is markedly different. A BBC survey published in 2016 found that in Sierra Leone, about 53 percent of people own mobile phones, and about three-quarters of those owned basic cell phones, not smartphones.

“I've done a lot of racial equity work in my community, I've been a guest speaker at several conferences,” says Taylor. “So when I was presented with this opportunity to do research, I couldn't help but go at it with an equity lens.”

Before the Covid-19 pandemic, Taylor spent most of her time after school in the Black History Game Show, a club she’s been a member of since eighth grade, and attending weekly school board and district meetings to advocate for an anti-racist curriculum. For the four months leading up to her first regional science fair in February 2020, Taylor committed Friday afternoons to research under the guidance of her chemistry teacher, Carolyn Walling.

Healthy human skin is naturally acidic, with a pH around five. But when a wound becomes infected, its pH goes up to about nine. Changes in pH can be detected without electronics; many fruits and vegetables are natural indicators that change color at different pH levels.

“I found that beets changed color at the perfect pH point,” says Taylor. Bright red beet juice turns dark purple at a pH of nine. “That's perfect for an infected wound. And so, I was like, ‘Oh, okay. So beets is where it's at.’”

Next, Taylor had to find a suture thread that would hold onto the dye. She tested ten different materials, including standard suture thread, for how well they picked up and held the dye, whether the dye changed color when its pH changed, and how their thickness compared to standard suture thread. After her school transitioned to remote learning, she could spend four or five hours in the lab on an asynchronous lesson day, running experiments.

A cotton-polyester blend checked all the boxes. After five minutes under an infection-like pH, the cotton-polyester thread changes from bright red to dark purple. After three days, the purple fades to light gray.

Working with an eye on equity in global health, she hopes that the color-changing sutures will someday help patients detect surgical site infections as early as possible so that they can seek medical care when it has the most impact. Taylor plans to patent her invention. In the meantime, she’s waiting for her final college admissions results.

“To get to the Top 40, this is like post-doctoral work that these kids are doing,” says Maya Ajmera, the president and CEO of the Society for Science, which runs the Science Talent Search. This year’s top prizes went to a matching algorithm that can find pairs in an infinite pool of options, a computer model that can help identify useful compounds for pharmaceutical research and a sustainable drinking water filtration system. The finalists also voted to grant Taylor the Seaborg Award, making her a spokesperson for their cohort.

Kathryn Chu, the director of the Center for Global Surgery at Stellenbosch University in South Africa, focuses on improving equitable access to surgical care. “I think it is amazing that this young high school scientist was inspired to work on a solution to address this problem,” the surgeon writes in an email. “A product that could detect early [surgical site infections] would be extremely valuable.”

However, she adds, “how this concept could translate from the bench to the bedside needs further testing.”

Current suture threads are good at their job: they’re affordable, they’re not irritating on the skin, and they are strong enough to hold a wound together. The beet juice-dyed thread will need to be competitive on all of these attributes. Surgical site infections can also occur below the surface of a wound—a C-section involves cutting through, and then repairing, not just the skin but also the muscle underneath. As it stands, the color-changing suture thread wouldn’t help detect an infection below the skin, and “if the infection oozes through the skin, or involves the skin, the infection has already reached later stages,” writes Chu.

Lastly, the same non-absorbency that makes standard suture thread hard to dye with beet juice also keeps bacteria out, and vice versa. While cotton thread’s braided structure gives it the ability to pick up the beet dye, it also provides a hiding place for bacteria that cause infections.

Taylor has been pursuing a line of research since the beginning of her project that might counteract the risks posed by using cotton.

“I read some studies that said beet juice was antibacterial. And although I want to take their word, I wanted to try it for myself. I wanted to reproduce their results,” says Taylor.

But studying bacteria requires specific, sterile practices that neither Taylor, nor her mentors Walling and Michelle Wikner, both chemistry teachers, were initially familiar with. In the months leading up to the Science Talent Search competition, Taylor connected with microbiologist Theresa Ho at University of Iowa to create a research plan incorporating the proper techniques, and that work is ongoing.

Reflecting on the science fair experience, Taylor most wants to thank Carolyn Walling for encouraging her to participate. “We're kind of basking in all of this together,” she says, especially because it’s her first year doing independent research. She’s also thankful for the support of her community.

“I have so much school pride because when somebody in our school does something great, they're celebrated to its fullest extent,” says Taylor. “And being able to be one of those kids has been so amazing.”

After graduation, Taylor hopes to attend Howard University, study political science and eventually become a lawyer.

“I am looking forward to seeing how Dasia uses this project moving forward,” says Ajmera. “And on a long-term scale, I’m really interested in watching what problems she is going to continue to solve, to make the world a better place.”",https://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/high-schooler-invented-color-changing-sutures-detect-infection-180977345/
Gun-rights advocates pick-up trash after protesting peacefully in Richmond,Gun-rights advocates pick-up trash after protesting peacefully in Richmond | 8News,1.0,"RICHMOND, Va. (WRIC) — Thousands flooded the surrounding streets of the Capitol Monday for a gun-rights rally, however, some locals in the area say the roads are the cleanest they’ve seen in quite some time.

There’s a reason for that, says Matthew Keisling, a protester who made sure that once he shared his message, he went above and beyond to protect it.

“I’ve been in the area when there have been other protests and demonstrations and people leave a lot of trash behind and it waters down the message,” Keisling said.

MORE LOBBY DAY COVERAGE:

Advocates told 8News they made sure to clean up after the rally because they felt leaving trash behind “represents the group and the movement very poorly.”

Locals in the city appreciated the gesture, even if it was unexpected.

“They picked everything up and made it look nice,” said Richmond resident Jack Hamilton. “It was really good for them to do that and it looks a lot better and good job.”

Around 22,000 pro-gun activists took the streets of downtown Richmond. The protest was peaceful, with most of the controversy stemming from the fact that participants cleaned up after themselves.

“There’s just cans and you know boxes and trash on the corners and like sidewalks but it looks a lot better,” Hamilton said. “It really does.”

"Beloved YouTuber Shirley ""Skyrim Grandma"" Curry Will Be an NPC in The Elder Scrolls 6","82 year old youtuber know as the ""skyrim Grandma"" will be added as an nPC in the upcoming game The elder scrolls 6",1.0,"Got a news tip? Is there something you think we should be reporting on? Email news@usgamer.net.

If you saw Shirley Curry on the street, you would not assume she is a YouTuber who has amassed nearly 500,000 subscribers. She's 82-years-old, has four sons and nine grandchildren (according to her YouTube bio, she is also sadly a widow), and in her free time loves to play and record video games. One of her favorites: The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim, of course.

Lovingly called ""Skyrim Grandma,"" Curry has a massive following. In 2018, fans started a petition to render her as an NPC in The Elder Scrolls 6, which was announced at E3 2018.

The great demand from fans did not go unheard by the team at Bethesda Softworks. During a The Elder Scrolls 25th anniversary stream today, Bethesda announced that it will indeed be making Curry as an NPC in the upcoming The Elder Scrolls 6. A video looking back on the series' fandom briefly shows her character model being made. (You can see the process at 8:40 in the video above.)

""That petition for Skyrim Grandma we did hear, and she will be immortalized in the game,"" Todd Howard said during today's livestreamed panel. ""This means a lot to me because I would be extremely happy to know that somebody else was playing with my character in a future Elder Scrolls game,"" Curry herself said during a special video celebrating the series.

Technically, the model of Curry is just the second glimpse we've seen of Elder Scrolls 6, aside from the simple pan of its landscape and the rough title back at E3 2018. It's a sweet sentiment to see footage of Bethesda inviting Curry to its studio to capture her likeness for the game. (It's unknown if she will be voicing her cameo too.) Unfortunately, we won't be seeing Skyrim Grandma in The Elder Scrolls 6 anytime soon, due to it being in early development.

Disney heir calls on company to give 50% of exec bonuses to lowest-paid employees,Disney heir calls on company to give 50% of exec bonuses to lowest-paid employees,1.0,"New York (CNN Business) Abigail Disney is doubling down on her criticism of executive pay at her family's company .

Just days after calling the pay of Disney's top brass ""insane,"" the granddaughter of company co-founder Roy Disney wrote an opinion piece in the Washington Post , in which she acknowledged she ""struck a nerve with a Twitter thread about wage inequality at the Walt Disney Co.""

""I believe that Disney could well lead the way, if its leaders so chose, to a more decent, humane way of doing business,"" she wrote in a piece published Tuesday.

She proposes the company put aside half of the bonuses its executives earn, distributing that to the bottom 10% of200,000 employees.

According to a regulatory filing, six of Disney's top executives, including CEO Bob Iger, received stock awards and options worth a combined $62 million last year. That doesn't include the additional bonuses — and potentially millions of dollars more — earned by lower-tier executives at the media and theme park conglomerate.

""Besides, at the pay levels we are talking about, an executive giving up half his bonus has zero effect on his quality of life,"" she writes. ""For the people at the bottom, it could mean a ticket out of poverty or debt. It could offer access to decent health care or an education for a child.""

about executive pay went viral. Last weekend, Abigail Disney's rant on Twitter about executive pay went viral.

""There's a point at which there's just too much going around the top of the system into this class of people who — I'm sorry this is radical — have too much money,"" she said.

In the Washington Post piece, Abigail Disney reiterated her criticism of the company's pay for its lowest-paid workers. The company says it pays above the $7.25-an-hour federal minimum wage: Workers at its Florida resorts will make $15 per hour by 2021 , while employees at Disneyland in California had their pay increased to $15 an hour at the start of this year. But Abigail Disney said that's not enough.

""This argument fails to acknowledge that the cost of living varies from place to place and few can make do on that, no matter where they live,"" she wrote.

She also took issue with the Republican-led tax reform, saying major corporations who benefited from the lower tax rate have put the extra money into executive pay and share buybacks -- and not in their workers.

""At a company that has never been more profitable, whose top executives drive home with seven- and eight-figure paychecks and whose primary resource is the good-spirited, public-facing people who greet guests day after day, why are we dancing around a minimum wage anyway?,"" she added.

Abigail Disney wrote that while she believes that executives deserve bonuses, the ""people who contribute to its success also deserve a share of the profits they have helped make happen.""

The Disney company reported a record profit in 2018.

""Here is my suggestion to the Walt Disney Co. leadership. Lead,"" she concluded. ""Reward all of your workers fairly. Don't turn away when they tell you they are unable to make ends meet. You do not exist merely for the benefit of shareholders and managers.""

Responding to the criticism, the Disney company said it has made ""historic investments"" in its workers' pay and benefits, including education initiatives that allow hourly employees the ability to earn a college or vocational degree ""completely free of charge."" The company said it has upped the starting hourly salary at Disneyland to $15 and pledged as much as $150 million to the education effort.

The company also defended Iger's pay, which it said is ""90% performance-based.""

""He has delivered exceptional value for shareholders: Disney's market capitalization has grown exponentially over the last decade, rising $75 billion in the last month alone, and the stock price has increased to $132 a share from $24 a share when Mr. Iger became CEO in 2005,"" a Disney spokesperson told CNN Business.",https://www.cnn.com/2019/04/24/media/abigial-disney-executive-pay/index.html
University of Wisconsin-Madison to offer free tuition for families making less than $56K,University of Wisconsin-Madison to offer free tuition for families making less than $56K,1.0,"The University of Wisconsin-Madison will now offer free tuition and fees for in-state students from households that make less than $56,000 a year, The Associated Press reported.

The program, called Bucky’s Tuition Promise, is the latest move by a major university to try and make higher education more accessible and affordable for students.

In-state students at UW-Madison currently pay $10,533 a year in tuition and fees.

""Many low- and middle-income families in Wisconsin simply don't know whether they can afford to come to UW-Madison,"" Chancellor Rebecca Blank said as she announced the program, according to the AP.

""Indeed, if they just read the popular press about student debt and sky-rocketing tuition their assumption will be that they can't. We want to make it very clear to low- and moderate-income families in Wisconsin that we're going to do everything we can to make this an affordable school,” she continued.

Similar programs are growing in popularity across higher education as advocates argue that high tuition costs are blocking students from pursuing degrees. Six other colleges in the Big Ten athletics conference, of which UW-Madison is a member, have similar offers.

Senate Approves Proposal To Strip Confederate Names From Army Bases By Veto-Proof Majority,Senate Approves Proposal To Strip Confederate Names From Army Bases By Veto-Proof Majority,1.0,"The Senate overwhelmingly approved a defense bill on Thursday that included Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s (D-MA) provision requiring the military to rename U.S. bases named after Confederate generals.

The bill passed by a vote of 86-14, a veto-proof majority that would override President Donald Trump’s effort to kill the measure, which he had threatened to do at the end of June after Warren announced her proposal.

“I will Veto the Defense Authorization Bill if the Elizabeth ‘Pocahontas’ Warren (of all people!) Amendment, which will lead to the renaming (plus other bad things!) of Fort Bragg, Fort Robert E. Lee, and many other Military Bases from which we won Two World Wars, is in the Bill!” he tweeted at the time.

Warren slammed Trump’s hostile response on the Senate floor shortly afterward, declaring that the President had “chosen a well-worn path of hatred and division.”

“The Confederate soldiers who betrayed the United States to fight for the Confederacy were fighting for the institution of slavery. Plain. Simple. Ugly,” the Democratic senator said. “It is time to put the names of those leaders who fought and killed U.S. soldiers in defense of a perverted version of America where they belong, as footnotes in our history books, not plastered on our nation’s most significant military installations.”

"Burnout, stress lead more companies to try a four-day work week","Burnout, stress lead more companies to try a four-day work week. It leads to higher productivity, more motivated staff.",1.0,"(Corrects paragraph 4 to identify Perpetual Guardian as a trust company instead of an insurance company; corrects paragraph 13 to reflect that the study was conducted by Kronos and Future Workplace)

BERLIN (Reuters) - Work four days a week, but get paid for five?

It sounds too good to be true, but companies around the world that have cut their work week have found that it leads to higher productivity, more motivated staff and less burnout.

“It is much healthier and we do a better job if we’re not working crazy hours,” said Jan Schulz-Hofen, founder of Berlin-based project management software company Planio, who introduced a four-day week to the company’s 10-member staff earlier this year.

In New Zealand, trust company Perpetual Guardian reported a fall in stress and a jump in staff engagement after it tested a 32-hour week earlier this year.

Even in Japan, the government is encouraging companies to allow Monday mornings off, although other schemes in the workaholic country to persuade employees to take it easy have had little effect.

Britain’s Trades Union Congress (TUC) is pushing for the whole country to move to a four-day week by the end of the century, a drive supported by the opposition Labour party.

The TUC argues that a shorter week is a way for workers to share in the wealth generated by new technologies like machine learning and robotics, just as they won the right to the weekend off during the industrial revolution.

“It would reduce the stress of juggling working and family life and could improve gender equality. Companies that have already tried it say it’s better for productivity and staff wellbeing,” said TUC economic head Kate Bell.

OVERWORKED

Lucie Greene, trends expert at consultancy J. Walter Thompson, said there was a growing backlash against overwork, underlined by a wave of criticism after Tesla TSLA.O boss Elon Musk tweeted that ""nobody ever changed the world on 40 hours a week.""

“People are starting to take a step back from the 24-hour digital life we have now and realize the mental health issues from being constantly connected to work,” Greene said.

A recent survey of 3,000 employees in eight countries including the United States, Britain and Germany found that nearly half thought they could easily finish their tasks in five hours a day if they did not have interruptions, but many are exceeding 40 hours a week anyway - with the United States leading the way, where 49 percent said they worked overtime.

“There has been work creep. Because you always have the technology, you are always working, so people are getting burned out,” said Dan Schawbel, director of executive development firm Future Workplace, which conducted the survey with Kronos.

Schulz-Hofen, a 36-year-old software engineer, tested the four-day week on himself after realizing he needed to slow down following a decade of intense work launching Planio, whose tools allowed him to track his time in detail.

“I didn’t get less work done in four days than in five because in five days, you think you have more time, you take longer, you allow yourself to have more interruptions, you have your coffee a bit longer or chat with colleagues,” Schulz-Hofen said.

“I realized with four days, I have to be quick, I have to be focused if I want to have my free Friday.”

Schulz-Hofen and his team discussed various options before settling on everybody working Monday to Thursday. They rejected the idea of flexible hours because it adds administrative complexity, and were against a five-day week with shorter hours as it is too easy for overwork to creep back in.

Clients who call on a Friday hear a recorded message explaining why nobody is at the office.

Peter Wang, a 15-year-old member of the Junior ROTC who was killed as he tried to help fellow students escape a mass shooting in Parkland, Fla., last week, has been posthumously admitted to the U.S. Military Academy.

Peter and two other freshman cadets, Martin Duque and Alaina Petty, both 14, were also awarded the Medal of Heroism — the highest medal given to Junior Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps cadets.

Classmates and family said that Peter dreamed of attending West Point. The admission to the academy came on the same day as his funeral.

""It was an appropriate way for USMA to honor this brave young man,"" the academy said in a statement. ""West Point has given posthumous offers of admissions in very rare instances for those candidates or potential candidates whose actions exemplified the tenets of duty, honor and country.""

Peter was reportedly wearing his gray Junior ROTC shirt when he was killed while holding the door open so others could escape a gunman who fatally shot 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School last Wednesday.

""He saved people's lives,"" Victoria Downing, one of Peter's classmates, said at his funeral service, according to The Sun Sentinel. ""He deserves it.""

Kroger to ban plastic checkout bags by 2025. CEO Rodney McMullen says 'The plastic shopping bag's days are numbered.',"Kroger, America's largest supermarket chain to ban plastic checkout bags and transition to reusable ones and ultimately eliminate 123 million pounds of garbage annually sent to landfills",1.0,"Kroger said it will ban all plastic checkout bags by 2025.

America's largest supermarket chain said it will transition from single-use to reusable bags and ultimately eliminate 123 million pounds of garbage annually sent to landfills. That would quadruple the amount of plastic the retailer currently recycles.

Kroger currently sells reusable bags starting at $1 each. Kroger will ramp up the availability of those bags. Shoppers for the foreseeable future will still have the option of asking for paper bags.

Kroger said it is also looking to cut back or phase out plastic bags for produce and meat, but it's focusing on eliminating checkout bags for now.

The ban will directly affect a wide swath of consumers: Kroger serves 9 million customers every day at its nearly 2,800 stores in 35 states and the District of Columbia.

Kroger's Seattle-based QFC subsidiary, with 63 stores in the Pacific Northwest, will be the first division to eliminate the bags by 2019.

More:Kroger to ditch plastic bags in 7 years: Here's what people are saying

Besides hundreds of its namesake stores in the Midwest and the South, Kroger operates hundreds more under the Harris Teeter, Ralphs, Fred Meyer, Fry's and other nameplates.

Kroger officials said they are responding to growing environmental concerns raised by shoppers, employees, communities and nonprofits.

""The plastic shopping bag’s days are numbered,"" Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen wrote in an editorial submitted to The Enquirer and USAToday. ""Our customers have told us it makes no sense to have so much plastic only to be used once before being discarded – And they’re exactly right.""

Kroger's decision will pressure other major competitors to follow suit. With nearly $123 billion in annual sales, Kroger is the second-largest grocer (behind Walmart, which is a mass discount retailer that gets half its $500 billion in sales from food).

""We're the first major retailer in the U.S. to do this,"" said Jessica Adelman, Kroger's vice president of corporate affairs, which oversees company environmental and sustainability efforts.

Kroger officials didn't spell out why it will take seven years to make the transition, saying completion will depend on how quickly consumers embrace the switch.

Kroger said it will order more reusable bags, market their availability, train checkout clerks to suggest them. Company officials said they'd like to get more customers using reusable bags to east the trasition before they remove plastic bags as an option.

Kroger uses 6 billion such bags annually, while the industry discards an estimated 100 billion bags each year.

Only 5 percent of supermarket bags are recycled by consumers. Last year, Kroger collected almost 38 million pounds of plastic for recycling in those in-store bins at the front of stores.

Additionally, Kroger recycled another 28 million pounds of plastic from other operations for a total of 66 million pounds.

The ban comes as individual cities concerned about environmental impact have moved to outlaw such waste.

Kroger officials said they decided to implement the transition at QFC because of the division's small size and half its stores already are under a ban enacted by Seattle in 2012.

The debate over plastic shopping bags has spread across the nation.

In 2016, a statewide referendum on California's 2016 ban of plastic bags fell short of repealing the law, so it remains in effect.

Kroger's Los Angeles-based subsidiary Ralphs operates under the California law. The legislation banned plastic single-use bags, but authorized a heavier plastic bag (different than standard reusable bags) designed for multiple uses that shoppers can buy for 10 cents apiece (the money goes to retailers for the expense of the bags).

Hawaii (where Kroger has no stores) has a de facto statewide as its largest counties have outlawed them.

Other cities that have enacted bans on plastic shopping bags are Austin, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco. Still, the Texas Supreme Court invalidated Austin's and other Lone Star municipalities' local bans this summer.

Other cities and counties that are beginning to crack down with fees are: Boulder, Colorado; Brownsville, Texas; Montgomery County, Maryland; New York City; Portland, Maine; and Washington, D.C.

Meanwhile, several states in the Midwest, South and the West have passed laws preventing local governments from enacting their own bans: Arizona, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri and Wisconsin.

""Though the majority of bills propose a ban or fee on bags, or improve recycling programs, most enacted legislation in recent years deals with preemption of local government action,"" said the National Conference of State Legislators in May.

LeBron James forms group to stop black voter suppression,LeBron James forms group to stop black voter suppression,1.0,"LeBron James announced Wednesday that he and several other professional athletes plan to found a charitable organization to protect black Americans' voting rights, five months ahead of the presidential election, The New York Times reported.

The move comes as mammoth protests have swept the United States and the world calling for an end to hundreds of years of racial discrimination against black people.

""We feel like we're getting some ears and some attention, and this is the time for us to finally make a difference,"" James told the Times.

The organization, called More Than A Vote, aims to encourage African Americans to register to vote and to show up to the polls for the November 3 elections.

The group will also fight against any factors that could contribute to African Americans' disenfranchisement.

""Yes, we want you to go out and vote, but we're also going to give you the tutorial,"" James told the Times. ""We're going to give you the background of how to vote and what they're trying to do, the other side, to stop you from voting.""

James, who has more than 135 million followers across Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, said he plans to use social media to denounce attempts to limit voting by racial minorities.

""King James"" himself will finance the project, joined by basketball players Trae Young and Jalen Rose, football player Alvin Kamara and comedian Kevin Hart.

The group plans to collaborate with other get-out-the-vote organizations, the newspaper reported, including When We All Vote and Fair Fight.

The initiative comes as the U.S. grapples with renewed anger over racism and police violence after the death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old African-American man who was killed last month when a police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.

James had expressed his own anger on Instagram, posting Floyd's last words ""I can't breathe.""

But James' voting rights move immediately drew pushback from leading Hong Kong democracy activist Joshua Wong, who tweeted about James' failure to back protesters there:

Defending democracy is vital, but @KingJames only talks loud in the US. On China, not only is he silent, he actively shuts others up. He called @dmorey ""misinformed"" and ""not really educated"" for supporting #HongKong. All he cares about is money, not human rights. Hypocritical. https://t.co/vxVMWIjsjY — Joshua Wong 黃之鋒 😷 (@joshuawongcf) June 11, 2020

The voting movement is not the Los Angeles Laker's first foray into politics. He appeared at a campaign event for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016.

Nor is it his first charitable endeavor: He has offered university scholarships through the LeBron James Family Foundation and even set up a school for third through eighth graders in his home state of Ohio.

James also heads a production studio producing a documentary about the massacre of approximately 300 African Americans in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1921.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lebron-james-and-others-starting-voting-rights-group-amid-george-floyd-protests/
Black man has convinced 200 racists to abandon the KKK,Killing hatred with kindness: Black man has convinced 200 racists to abandon the KKK by making friends with them despite their prejudiced views,1.0,"He said he had to beat up two KKK followers after they

A black man has single-handedly caused more than 200 white racists to leave the Ku Klux Klan simply by confronting their prejudice with friendship.

Inspirational Daryl Davis, 58, a blues musician and author, has travelled all over the US since the early 1980s actively seeking out and befriending members of the openly racist organisation.

The KKK is a white supremacy cult founded in 1865 organizing members to persecute people for the color of their skin or their religious beliefs.

Daryl Davis stands at a burning of the cross ceremony with KKK members in the background. The burning is synonymous with the group who do it as a mark of their religion and for intimidation

But Daryl Davis has been battling the hatred and answering a call he has felt since he was a young man when he decided to confront the ideology of the KKK head-on one member at a time.

He has since documented his incredible mission in the book 'Klan-destine Relationships: A Black Man's Odyssey in the Ku Klux Klan' which is set to be re-released with an updated version next year.

Daryl, from Chicago, has also found time for a celebrated music career in R&B and blues, playing alongside the likes of Jerry Lee Lewis, Chuck Berry and former President Bill Clinton, and he counted the legendary Muddy Waters among his friends.

Daryl said: 'Music absolutely played a massive role in bridging many gaps in the racial divides I would encounter. Once when I was performing in a predominantly white venue, a white man approached me on my break and put his arm around me and exclaimed, ""This is the first time I've ever heard a black man play piano like Jerry Lee Lewis.""

The musician has met many prominent members of the white supremacist group and has made friends along the way

'I quickly enlightened him as to the origin of Jerry Lee's music and told him that Jerry Lee had learned that style from black Boogie Woogie and blues piano players.

'The man did not believe me, despite the fact that I further told him that Jerry Lee was a good friend of mine and he had told me himself where he learned that style. But, the gentleman was fascinated with the idea that a black man could play like that.

'He was curious and wanted to learn more about me. It was then revealed to me by him that he was a member of the Ku Klux Klan. Over time, he and I became good friends. He ended up leaving the KKK.'

Daryl said he is never unprepared for violence from those he meets, as any member he confronts can potentially be someone who would want to do him harm. In those rare cases, he said one of them ended up in hospital and the other in jail.

'Some of them are absolutely repulsed when they see a black person and want to hurt that person,' said Daryl

He said: 'There have been some incidents in which I was threatened and a couple of instances where I had to physically fight. Fortunately, I won in both instances.

'These things happen from time to time, but it is to be expected, because you are dealing with someone who hates you and wants to be violent just because of the colour of your skin.

'Some of them are absolutely repulsed when they see a black person and want to hurt that person. At the core of it, although they won't at first admit it, they express superiority, but truly feel inferiority and in order to elevate themselves, they have to push someone else down.'

A meeting that could have ended up in violence was when Daryl met a Grand Dragon, a rank in the KKK, in Maryland, a man called Roger Kelly.

Daryl said: 'I was very well prepared for the meeting in terms of knowledge of my topic. I have just about every book written on the Klan and I've read them all.

'In fact, I know more about the KKK than most Klan members know about their own organisation. Knowledge, information, wit, and the way you disseminate these attributes can often prove to be a more disarming weapon against an enemy or some with whom your ideology is in conflict, than violence or lethal weapons.

'I was heavily armed with those attributes. I had been told by someone who knew him very well, that Roger Kelly would kill me. I felt confident without any physical weapon that I would prevail. Fortunately, I proved it true.'

In fact Daryl said he was so successful in his prevailing that the KKK 'branch' in Maryland is now non-existent, with perhaps four people turning up for a meeting 'and two of them are drunk'.

The KKK calls for the white 'purification' of the US and have killed black people in its long history

He said: 'It's a wonderful thing when you see a light bulb pop on in their heads or they call you and tell you they are quitting.

'I never set out to convert anyone in the Klan. I just set out to get an answer to my question: ""How can you hate me when you don't even know me?""

'I simply gave them a chance to get to know me and treat them the way I want to be treated. They come to their own conclusion that this ideology is no longer for them. I am often the impetus for coming to that conclusion and I'm very happy that some positivity has come out of my meetings and friendships with them.

Daryl traveled a lot as a child as his parents served with the American Foreign Service, and he said it was that experience of different cultures that helped him see just how alien the idea of racism is..

Daryl at another KKK burning of the cross even. He also alluded to the US election saying that all racists he knows voted for Donald Trump but not all Trump supporters are racist

He said: 'When I would return home every two years, it baffled me as to why people judged others by their skin colour. This was a very strange concept to me.

'This is a quote from the American author Mark Twain, which I find to be most accurate: 'Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness, and many of our people need it sorely on these accounts. Broad, wholesome, charitable views of men and things cannot be acquired by vegetating in one little corner of the earth all one's lifetime'.'

Despite his incredible work Daryl does receive some mixed reactions to making friendships with people who have held such extremist views.

He said: 'There was surprise and shock on both sides (black and white), mostly from people who don't know me, or who haven't bothered to research me, read up on me, or hear my interviews or lectures.

'Not all, but most of the criticism has come from black people. I have been called a 'sellout', 'Uncle Tom', 'Oreo' and a number of other terrible names.

'Unfortunately, I must compare these particular black people with the KKK and other white supremacist groups, with no distinction, other than the colour of their skin.

Davis with a Klan member. He said that most racists he knows voted for Donald Trump in the November presidential election

'This is because they are engaging in the exact same hateful behaviour as they accuse the white racists. I can explain it like this, because I've seen it on both sides.

Daryl said America today was probably less racist than it had been in the past but that he continues his work every day.

'In Israel, it's Palestinian versus. Jew. In Lebanon, it's Christian versus. Muslim. In Iraq, it's Sunni Muslim versus Shiite Muslim. In certain African countries, the conflict is tribal. In India, we see a caste system based on the shade of skin color and classicism.

'There has always been a great deal of racism in the U.S. before and after Obama. However, racism in the US is down, post Obama.

'What you are seeing is those people who were dormant racists, being given a new lease on life by the sentiments of our new President-Elect.",http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4055162/Killing-hatred-kindness-Black-man-convinced-200-racists-abandon-KKK-making-friends-despite-prejudiced-views.html?ITO=1490&ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&utm_source=fark&utm_medium=website&utm_content=link&ICID=ref_fark
Kelloggs use rejected cornflakes to make beer in bid to cut down on food waste,Kelloggs is using rejected cornflakes to make beer in an effort to cut down on food waste,1.0,"Consumers concerned about their carbon footprint will soon be able to drink beer and assuage their guilt over the environment at the same time as Kelloggs releases a beer made from leftover cornflakes.

As shoppers increasingly worry about the environmental impact of their purchases, companies have had to find creative ways to minimise food waste.

The cereal company is the latest to join this trend, making beer out of the cornflakes at their factories which would otherwise be waste product.

‘Throw Away IPA’, made by Seven Bro7thers Brewery in Manchester, uses ""upcycled"" cornflakes which are too big, small or overcooked to go in a box of breakfast cereal as a proportion of the wheat grain which goes into the beer.

A spokesperson for Kelloggs said that around 30 per cent of the grain content of the beer will be cornflakes, and 70 per cent wheat.

It is added during the ""mash"" process and reportedly sweetens the taste.

The IPA, which is ""cornflake golden"" in colour, is also helping food distribution charity FareShare, as 10p from each can purchased will be donated to the cause.

Corporate social responsibility manager for Kellogg’s UK, Kate Prince, said: “Kellogg’s is always exploring different and sustainable ways to reduce food waste in its factories. So it is great to be involved in such a fun initiative with a local supplier.",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/12/05/kelloggs-use-rejected-cornflakes-make-beer-bid-cut-food-waste/
Young Man Invents “Water You Can Eat” to Help Dementia Patients Like His Grandma Stay Hydrated,"To help his grandmother stay hydrated, man creates “water you can eat” Jelly Drops that look like candy and appeal to people with dementia.",1.0,"People with Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia often suffer from dehydration issues for a variety of reasons. One of those reasons is that dementia patients may simply forget to drink water or forget where to find water, even if there’s a cup of it on the nightstand, inches away from them. Others may no longer find water palatable and forget that it is necessary, since they might not feel thirsty. Still others may even forget how to drink water or how to swallow. Dementia patients who suffer from dysphagia—a swallowing difficulty—often have a hard time swallowing thin liquids and require thickening agents to help them get the hydration they need.

When a patient reaches the last stages of dementia and is no longer getting the water they need due to one of the reasons listed above, they rely on the help of caretakers to provide water-laden foods and thickened or flavored beverages to combat dehydration.

None of the current methods will prevent people with dementia from dying of their disease, as there is currently no cure for the issue. But getting creative with hydration techniques can keep people with memory loss problems from experiencing the discomfort and pain of excessive thirst, developing other dehydration-related health issues, and even dying of dehydration.

A young man named Lewis Hornby noticed that his grandmother, who suffers from dementia, was not getting enough to drink and decided to invent something that would make it easier for her to get the fluids she needed. So he used sensory deprivation tools and VR tools to get a better understanding of the issue, spoke with a dementia psychologist, spent a week living in a dementia care home, consulted with doctors about how to create a hydrating product, and returned to the care home several times to test the prototypes of his project. All in an effort to do something to help.

“For people with dementia the symptoms of dehydration are often mistakenly attributed to their underlying condition, meaning it can easily go unnoticed until it becomes life-threatening,” Hornby writes on the James Dyson Award website. “About a year ago my grandma was unexpectedly rushed to hospital, she was found to be severely dehydrated. Thankfully, after 24 hours on IV fluids she was back to her normal happy self, and is still enjoying a good quality of life to this day.”

What Hornby came up with were Jelly Drops—brightly colored bite-sized balls of liquid that are easier to swallow than water but just as hydrating. The drops are made of 90 percent water with gelling agents and electrolytes to aid in hydration.

The drops don’t require any utensils, are firm and easy to grasp, and don’t leave any residue on the hands. The packaging doesn’t look like a medical device of any sort, so it’s not threatening; instead, it looks like an inviting box of candies.

Hornby says he’s found that people with dementia immediately recognize the colorful Jelly Drops as a treat and are eager to eat them, even if they would normally turn down other types of food or drinks.

“When first offered, grandma ate 7 Jelly Drops in 10 minutes,” says Hornby, “the equivalent to a cup full of water, something that would usually take hours and require much more assistance.”

Hornby carefully thought through the packaging of his Jelly Drops as well. The clear plastic box allows patients to see the goodies inside without lifting the lid, making the Jelly Drops easier to find if misplaced and easier to remember to eat. There’s also a special handle on one corner so that users can open the lid without putting down the box. Then a locking hinge holds the lid in its upright position, freeing a hand to eat with. This is particularly important since many dementia patients struggle to plan and execute sequences of actions.

Jelly Drops have won the Helen Hamlyn Design Award, Snowdon Award for Disability, and the Dyson School of Design Engineering DESIRE Award for Social Impact. They are being trialed in other care homes in the UK, and Hornby hopes to do more research and begin production of his drops soon. Hopefully this ingenious invention will help thousands of current and future dementia patients get the hydration they need to stay comfortable, healthy, and alive—and enjoy it at the same time!

Check out the video below to see how much Hornby’s Grandma Pat enjoys her Jelly Drops!

Thank you, Lewis Hornby, for harnessing your compassion for your grandmother into an innovative product that will help so many people get the fluids they need to survive. Your creativity and dedication are admirable, and the world needs more people like you!",https://blog.thealzheimerssite.com/jelly-drops/

‘I am free’: Colorado grandfather comes out as gay at age 90,‘I am free’: Colorado grandfather comes out as gay at age 90,1.0,"This is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated. Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.

ARVADA, Colo. (KDVR) – While we were all staying in during the coronavirus pandemic, Kenneth Felts was coming out.

After concealing his sexuality for 90 years, the Arvada father and grandfather used his time in COVID-19 isolation to write his memoir. On its pages, he revealed for the first time that he is gay. Once he delivered the news to his daughter, he shared it with the world in a Facebook post that has since gone viral. The story has been picked up by news agencies around the globe, and Felts has appeared on the BBC, Australian television and several programs in the United States.

“Having come out when I did has been the highlight of the rest of my life, I guess. I’ve never enjoyed so much love from unknown people all over the world,” Felts told FOX31.

He continues to receive messages of support on Facebook from well-wishers all around the globe.

Felts, a Korean War veteran who was married years ago, was initially perplexed by all of the interest in his story.

“I’m just an old guy who’s 90 who decided to get off the closet floor and walk out the door,” Felts joked.

October is LGBTQ History Month, which includes National Coming Out Day. Data from the U.S. Census estimates that there are about 3 million LGBTQ adults over age 50 living in the US, and that number is expected to grow to around 7 million by 2030. But elder members of the LGBTQ community are twice as likely to be single and live alone, four times less likely to have children, and far more likely than heterosexuals to have faced discrimination, social stigma and prejudice.

Still, coming out of the closet at age 90 is not as unusual as you might think.

“Some folks may come out after their spouse has passed away. I believe coming out is a process,” said Reynaldo Mireles, director of elder services at The Center on Colfax.

“I know that there are people who want to have relationships and may feel like they’re too old, but I believe you can find love at any moment in your life,” Mireles added.

“People are realizing this is a lot more common than they thought. It’s not as stigmatized because of the resources available to people,” said Levi Teachey, board member at PFLAG Denver, a support organization for the gay community.

“I admire all the courage and strength it took to do this. We’re here for people like Ken, who need resources and need to know that there’s somebody who’s got their back,” Teachey added.

Felts says he’s known he was gay since age 12, and had planned to take his sexuality with him to the grave. But a bout with cancer last year, coupled with his time in lockdown from the coronavirus, convinced him it was time to be his true self.

“It’s the freedom of doing whatever I want to do without regard to what other people might think about me. So it’s really been a burden lifted off my shoulders. I’m free, free, free!” Felts said.

More young people are watching Planet Earth 2 than The X Factor,More young people are watching Planet Earth 2 than The X Factor,1.0,"It seems the nation’s younger citizens are finally favouring the beauty of the natural world over the wailing of amateur singers.

The BBC has confirmed that the first three episodes of Planet Earth II have attracted more viewers in the 16 to 34 age bracket than The X Factor on ITV.

Sir David Attenborough credited improvements in technology with the show’s increased success in its second season, which have brought animals closer to the viewer than ever through the use of remote cameras and made their environments look stunningly high-definition and real.

“I’m told that we are attracting a larger than normal number of younger viewers and apparently the music of Hans Zimmer in particular is striking a chord,” the naturalist added to the Radio Times. “That pleases me enormously.”

Aside from technology and sound editing changes, Attenborough said that he believes viewers are simply “reconnecting with a planet whose beauty is blemished and whose health is failing”, growing to understand that their futures and that of the planet are inextricably linked.

Planet Earth II’s best ratings so far were for the Mountains-centric second episode, which brought in 1.8 million young viewers compared to The X Factor’s 1.4 million that week. ITV confirmed similar figures to The Times, albeit with a smaller margin.

“Visually, where Planet Earth took an almost God-like perspective and said ‘Let’s look down on the Earth and see the scale of the planet’, what Planet Earth II is doing is saying ‘Let’s get ourselves into the lives of the animals, and see it from their perspective,’” series producer Mike Gunton said recently.

“The visual signature of the series is that you feel like the camera is with the animals. It’s very fluid, very active. For example, you might see this wonderful lemur leaping through the forest. Normally when we’d film that, we’d be standing back observing it, but here the lemur almost jumps over your shoulder and as it’s jumping over your shoulder, you’re with it - the camera is running with it!”",http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/planet-earth-2-ii-young-viewers-x-factor-bbc-itv-david-attenborough-vieiwng-figures-ratings-a7449296.html
Irish teenager wins national science award for 'deepfake' video detector,"A teenage student in Ireland has won a national science competition for developing technology that can more easily detect ""deepfake"" videos online.",1.0,"A teenage student in Ireland has won a national science competition for developing technology that can more easily detect ""deepfake"" videos online.

Greg Tarr, from County Cork, was declared the winner of the 2021 BT Young Scientist & Technologist of the Year award last week for his project, ""Towards Deepfake Detection"".

The picture or audio of deepfake videos is altered by artificial intelligence (AI) to make it appear as though someone has said or done something they have not.

The viral spread of deepfake videos has caused international concern, in an age of digital news consumption, and social media companies have come under renewed scrutiny on how to tackle the spread of this misinformation.

An altered video, claiming to show US President-elect Joe Biden falling asleep during a television interview, was widely shared before November's election.

Speaking to Euronews, Tarr said he had developed advanced AI to help detect when a video has been altered.

""I've been working on AI for maybe four years and it's being trained to look at vast amounts of data,"" said Tarr, ""it's a concept that is currently being done, but mine is ten times faster.""

""It's amazing how few people understand how prevalent deepfakes are in current media,"" he added

The 17-year-old student will soon present his work at the European Union's Contest for Young Scientists.

""I look forward to representing my country in September with the same project or maybe an improved version, and I'm also looking forward to commercialising or 'productising' this development.""

The global crackdown on parents who refuse vaccines for their kids is on,The global crackdown on parents who refuse vaccines for their kids has begun: Countries like Italy and Australia are tired of measles outbreaks — so they're moving to fine anti-vaccine parents.,1.0,"There’s a school of thought that refusing vaccines on behalf of your children amounts to child abuse, and that parents should be punished for their decision. We know vaccines are overwhelmingly safe and effective at preventing the spread of disease, and failing to immunize children can put them (and vulnerable people around them) at tremendous risk of illness or even death when outbreaks occur.

Now it seems that Germany, Australia, and a number of other countries are fed up enough with vaccine-refusing parents that they’re experimenting with punitive measures. We haven’t quite reached the level of child abuse charges, but moms and dads in these countries may face fines if they fail to give their kids the recommended shots. In Australia, the directors of schools that let in the unvaccinated kids would be fined, too.

This marks a pretty aggressive shift in how we manage vaccine refusers and the costly, deadly outbreaks of diseases like measles and whooping cough they help spark.

Here’s a quick roundup of the global crackdown on vaccine-refusing parents:

In Germany on Thursday, lawmakers passed a law stating that parents need to prove they’ve vaccinated their kids against measles — or risk fines up to €2,500 (about $2,750). Unvaccinated children also risk losing their places in school.

on Thursday, lawmakers passed a law stating that parents need to prove they’ve vaccinated their kids against measles — or risk fines up to €2,500 (about $2,750). Unvaccinated children also risk losing their places in school. Italy’s parliament passed a law that makes 10 childhood vaccinations mandatory for kids up to age 16, and requires parents to prove their children are immunized before entering school or else face a €500 (about $560) noncompliance fine. And kids who aren’t vaccinated are being told not to come to school.

And kids who aren’t vaccinated are being told not to come to school. In France , the health ministry made 11 vaccines — up from the current three (diphtheria, tetanus, and polio) — mandatory for children, though there’s no talk of a fine yet.

, the health ministry made 11 vaccines — up from the current three (diphtheria, tetanus, and polio) — mandatory for children, though there’s no talk of a fine yet. Further afield, New South Wales , Australia , passed “no jab, no play” legislation in September 2017: The law bans unvaccinated kids from preschool and day care and fine the directors of schools that admit un-immunized children $5,500 Australian dollars ($4,400). The law in New South Wales is modeled on similarly stringent laws in other Australian states, and across the country, parents with children who aren’t immunized aren’t eligible for child care benefits.

The law in New South Wales is modeled on similarly stringent laws in other Australian states, and across the country, parents with children who aren’t immunized aren’t eligible for child care benefits. In the US, New York — where a large measles outbreak raged on for nearly a year — the government threatened parents who don’t vaccinate their children with a fine of up to $1,000.

These fines come amid a growing problem with measles globally. Over the past two years, measles cases have been edging up in countries around the world, with a 300 percent rise in cases over the same period in 2018, according to the World Health Organization.

Many countries where measles had been declared eliminated have recently lost that status, including Britain, Greece, Brazil, France, and Germany. With more than 1,200 measles cases this year — the largest number for any year since 1992 — the US also nearly lost its measles elimination status.

Before we consider punishing American parents, we might try this

Here, vaccine skeptics have also been persuading more parents in a number of states to refuse shots for their children. So is the US ready for a similar crackdown?

Punishing parents for doing things that could harm their kids is not without precedent in the US. For example, there are laws in various states requiring parents to use car seats or seat belts for their children or else pay a fine or be docked driver's license points. Same goes for firearm storage laws.

But before we start fining anti-vaxxers, there are some much more basic steps the US could take that would improve vaccination rates. And they involve simply making it harder for parents to opt out of routine shots on behalf of their kids.

Vaccines fall under the public health jurisdiction of the states. And there’s currently a lot of variation across the US when it comes to immunization requirements.

Even though all 50 states have legislation requiring vaccines for students entering school, 45 states allow exemptions for people with religious beliefs against immunizations, and 15 states currently grant philosophical exemptions for those opposed to vaccines because of personal or moral beliefs. (The exceptions are Mississippi, California, and West Virginia, and more recently, New York, and Maine, which now have the strictest vaccine laws in the nation, allowing only medical exemptions.)

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the parts of the country that make it easier for people to opt out of their shots tend to have higher rates of ... people opting out of vaccines. So a lax regulatory environment can create space for more parents to refuse vaccines.

That’s why some states have been moving to crack down on this trend — most notably California — which is already seeing success in terms of boosting vaccine coverage rates.

In 2015, another measles outbreak prompted California’s former governor, Jerry Brown, to sign a bill, SB277, that abolished all nonmedical exemptions. And the California experience is instructive for other states that might want to close some of their loopholes.

According to the state health department, the number of kindergarten students in the 2017-2018 school year with all their required vaccines was 95.1 percent — a 4.7 percentage point increase over 2014-2015 and the second highest reported vaccine rate since health authorities started tracking. A recent analysis, published in JAMA, put the opt-out rate at 4.8 percent by 2017.

Hidden within that increase is some conflicting data, said Saad Omer, director of the Yale Institute for Global Health. Since the law was enacted, medical exemptions have also increased, suggesting there may be an unintended effect of the crackdown on nonmedical exemptions.

That’s because something else was going on in California, and it offset that increase in medical exemptions: In parallel with abolishing nonmedical exemptions through SB277, California launched the “Conditional Entrant Intervention Project” in 2015. The idea was that public health professionals would work with local health departments to identify schools granting high rates of conditional entrants, and work with them to bring them down.

Between 2014 and 2015, Omer and his colleagues found a sharp 23 percent decline in the conditional admission rate. So even with the rise in medical exemptions, the overall vaccine exemption rate still went down thanks to the decline in conditional vaccine entry to schools.

Omer told Vox, “I’m not discounting eliminating nonmedical exemptions. It’s a reasonable option. But it may not resolve all issues.” That’s why California is now cracking down on bogus medical exemptions, too.

That means simply outlawing nonmedical exemptions may not be a panacea in states that have a high percentage of parents using their social capital to spread anti-vaccine views. And as we saw in California, a ban on nonmedical exemptions could even backfire if other vaccine loopholes are left open.

But lawmakers should look for ways that make it more inconvenient to opt out — by doing things like introducing exemptions with regular renewals. Fewer than a dozen states require annual — or more frequent — recertification for medical exemptions. So for example, if a child in a K-12 school gets an exemption in kindergarten, it will follow them through to college. She’ll never be asked to renew that exemption. Or, lawmakers could crack down on the conditional entry to school.

And they should move fast. The percentage of people seeking nonmedical exemptions — while still small — has also been creeping upward, from 1.1 percent in 2009-2010 to 2.2 percent by 2017-2018. Outbreaks in recent years have also been getting larger, Omer said. “That’s the canary in the coal mine for me.”",https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/8/3/16069204/vaccine-fines-measles-outbreaks-europe-australia
New York will start enforcing its styrofoam ban today. Here's where else it's banned,New York City has banned styrofoam!,1.0,"New York (CNN Business) New York City will begin officially enforcing its ban on styrofoam beginning Monday.

The city outlawed the material on January 1, 2019, but businesses were given a six-month transition period before the crackdown began. The ban largely affects food establishments that have used styrofoam for take-out or large beverages, and it alsoprohibits stores from selling ""packing peanuts."" Businesses are encouraged to switch to compostable materials, including paper.

The city banned styrofoam, also known as polystyrene, because the material can't be ""recycled in a manner that is economically feasible"" or ""environmentally effective"" in its recycling program. Violators will be fined $250 for the first offense, $500 for a second offense and $1,000 for third offenses and beyond.

last year ""New York City's ban on styrofoam is long overdue, and New Yorkers are ready to start using recyclable alternatives,"" New York Mayor Bill de Blasio saidlast year when he announced the ban . ""There's no reason to continue allowing this environmentally unfriendly substance to flood our streets, landfills and waterways.""

The styrofoam ban in New York makes it the largest US city to ban the material. Other cities that have banned it include San Diego, Miami Beach, Seattle and Washington, DC. The material is considered environmentally unfriendly because it breaks into smaller pieces and is hard to clean up. It also absorbs toxins faster than other plastics, and it is not biodegradable.",https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/01/business/new-york-styrofoam-ban-trnd/index.html
“I Think My Gmail Has Crashed”: The Teacher Who Made Bernie Sanders’ Mittens on Watching Them Go Viral,“I Think My Gmail Has Crashed”: The Teacher Who Made Bernie Sanders’ Mittens on Watching Them Go Viral,1.0,"Joe Biden’s inauguration doubled as a promenade of style, featuring thousand-dollar Dior Air Jordan 1s, monochromatic jewel-toned looks, and a skirt so wide it enforced its own sartorial social distancing. But the fashion icon who stole the show was, of all people, Sen. Bernie Sanders, whose casual ’fit became instant meme fodder, with special attention paid to his extremely cozy-looking mittens. Eagle-eyed observers noted that Sanders had been wearing these specific mittens for years.

Slate caught up with the mitten-maker herself, Jen Ellis, who lives in Essex Junction, Vermont. In between teaching her class of second graders, Ellis explained what it was like to see her mittens at the inauguration, how she came to give them to Sanders, and which memes are her favorites. This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.

Rachelle Hampton: I’m sure you’re being flooded with so many interview requests right now.

Jen Ellis: Yeah, I think my Gmail has crashed now. My report cards are due tomorrow, so I need to focus on some other things until the weekend, when this will probably not be a thing anymore.

What was your reaction when you saw Bernie wearing your mittens at the inauguration?

I was totally delighted. I was actually a little late to the game because I was remote teaching for the whole morning. I go to my classroom and remote-teach from my classroom. I think it’s important to just turn off all media and focus on your students, but my phone happened to not be on mute and it started dinging in my coat pocket and I was like, someone’s really trying to reach me. Like, maybe my parents are in danger?

As soon as I was done with my remote teaching, I hopped in my car and drove home. It was a huge blizzard yesterday up here in Vermont, so it took me forever. As soon as I walked in the door, my partner was like, “You’re not going to believe this.” We don’t watch TV—we’re intentionally a non-TV family—but we had taken the TV out of the closet so that our daughter could watch the inauguration. We found our bunny ears and we found a local station that would allow us to watch the inauguration. People had sent me pictures of Bernie Sanders sitting there in his chair, looking a little grumpy. Then the camera zoomed right in on him and I was like, there he is, he’s wearing my mittens. I was completely surprised and delighted and flattered and good for him.

Do you kind of wish he looked a bit less grumpy in this photo with your mittens that’s now gone viral?

No, I don’t actually think he was grumpy. I bet he was really excited to be there, even though it was bittersweet, right? Because he wanted to be in Biden’s shoes, but I’m sure he recognized the importance of that day and this whole change of power in America and I bet he was glad to be there. He is who he is and not everyone has a resting pleasant face.

Relatable. Speaking of bittersweet, you supported Bernie. How did you feel about watching Biden be sworn in as president?

Oh my gosh, I cried. I’m 42 and I’ve waited four decades of my life—I’m tearing up just thinking about it—to see a woman be vice president. I wish that she was president, although I think Biden is pretty great. It was so powerful to sit there with my 5-year-old daughter who I love so much and be like, this is where you enter politics, right? We have shielded you from Trump as much as possible. But this is what we want you to see, a wonderful, successful woman and a woman of color in such a powerful position. It was great to share that with her and my partner who’s also a woman, so we’re just a huge feminist household celebrating this momentous occasion.

And then there was this little side nagging thing of every five minutes I was getting several hundred more emails about the mittens. A year ago, when Bernie was on the campaign trail, he was wearing those mittens and Twitter buzzed about it then. I’m not really on Twitter—I have an account, but I don’t really participate—but a lot of my younger colleagues do and they were like “You’ve gotta check this out.” I went on Twitter and what I saw was some misinformation that bothered me. People were talking about how these mittens probably came from Bernie’s grandmother and they were a Christmas gift and they were knitted. There’s so much inaccuracy in that. Bernie’s Jewish. They were not a Christmas gift.

Advertisement

So I put it out there that I made the mittens, they were a gift, and they’re not knitted, they’re sewn from repurposed and up-cycled sweaters. At that time, I had 30 or 40 mittens for sale and being a little naïve about Twitter, I put my Gmail account on that, which someone picked up yesterday and retweeted it. People have been contacting me thinking that they can get mittens, and actually they can’t. I don’t have any more, and I don’t have much of a mitten business anymore because it really wasn’t worth it. Independent crafters get really taken for a ride by the federal government. We get taxed to the nth degree, and it wasn’t really worth it pursuing that as a business, even as a side hustle. I mostly just make them as gifts.

How did you come to give these mittens to Bernie?

His daughter-in-law owns and operates a preschool down the street from my house, and that’s where we sent our daughter from the time she was 15 months old. I was making gifts for the preschool teachers and I knew Liza was connected to Bernie, so I made an extra pair for him back when he lost the bid for the presidential nomination in 2016 to Hillary Clinton. I was just sad, because even though I like Hillary, I’m also super pro-Bernie and as a public school teacher, I can see every day how families are struggling. People are just trying to make ends meet and they need things like student loan forgiveness and free education and a lot of the things that Bernie is fighting for. I sent him these mittens kind of as a shoutout to who he is, and I put a note in that said something to the effect of “I hope you run again.”

Tell me a bit more about how you make the mittens.

The outer layer is made out of discarded wool sweaters, so wool sweaters that have moth holes or that someone sent through the washing machine or they were ripped or whatever, fallen out of fashion. I cut them up and I piece them together with other sweaters with complementary colors and I use the cuffs of the sweater to be the cuff of the mitten. Then I line them with fleece, which is also a recycled material, made out of plastic bottles, shredded plastic. I bought some thread at thrift stores, I used all the thread from my grandmother’s old sewing basket after she died, and I find recyclable thread or reusable thread but usually I buy the thread.

Do you have a favorite meme of Bernie wearing your mittens?

There’s one that’s a rainbow and it has all the different fashion from yesterday and all the other people, like red, orange, blue, and purple, are women and they’re wearing fancy designer clothing and the green color of the rainbow is Bernie. I would just love to get that one framed and just have it because it features Kamala Harris and Jill Biden and Amanda Gorman, all the heroes of yesterday were featured. And then there’s Bernie.

There’s another one, it’s just a picture of him sitting there by himself, but the caption says “I found my spot at Tanglewood and I’m not moving.” And Tanglewood is an outdoor music venue in Massachusetts and I love Tanglewood. I went to a little summer camp there when I was a kid, so that one was especially funny.

Advertisement

Honestly, I think that my slice of media is so limited because people are making these as we speak and I’m teaching reading lessons in a little rural Vermont school with the snow gently falling. I’ve had to turn everything off so I can focus on what my real life is. This is a really lovely flash in the pan, but I know that it’s not gonna last and I need to keep my day job. People have sent me legitimate offers, I’ve only seen a few of them but people have been like, “Oh I own a factory” or “Oh I’m a designer, I’m a businessperson, I could publicize your new business.” I can see that if I wanted to drop everything and pursue that path, I could do it, but who knows how long that would last? The path that I’m already on brings me a tremendous amount of joy and I think that’s the greatest symbol of success, right? This little blip of fame is sweet, and it’ll pass, and then my regular life will just be what it already is, which is kind of nice.

Do you think you’ll continue making mittens just to gift to people you know?

Yeah, I definitely will. Sometimes people approach me, and their mother just died and their mother knitted one precious sweater for their child that never was worn and never fit and they ask me if I’ll turn that into mittens because they want to keep it. So in that sense, I think I’ll definitely keep making mittens for people.",https://slate.com/human-interest/2021/01/bernie-sanders-inauguration-mittens-vermont-teacher-interview.html

"New Zealand to purchase Covid-19 vaccines for Pacific Island neighbours, including Samoa and Tonga","New Zealand to purchase Covid-19 vaccines for Pacific Island neighbours, including Samoa and Tonga",1.0,"New Zealand will purchase enough Covid-19 vaccines to cover its Pacific Island neighbours, including Samoa and Tonga.

The Government on Thursday announced it has signed two further pre-purchase agreements for Covid-19 vaccines, allowing it to begin vaccinating New Zealand's entire population from mid-2021.

Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta said New Zealand would also purchase enough vaccines for New Zealand Realm countries Tokelau, Niue, and the Cook Islands, as well as neighbours Tonga, Samoa, and Tuvalu, if those countries want to take up the offer.

The Government had allocated $75 million of development assistance money to help roll out the vaccine to these countries.

Hagen Hopkins/Getty Images Foriegn Minister Nanaia Mahuta says New Zealand will support Pacific Island neighbours to roll out Covid-19 vaccines.

“Pacific countries have worked hard to keep Covid-19 out, or to stamp it out, and New Zealand has been committed to supporting them in this,” Mahuta said in a statement.

“But their success has been hard-won. A safe and effective vaccine will be key to the region’s economic and social recovery.”

Some $10m of the $75m assistance funding will go to the global COVAX facility, which works to provide equal access vaccines to countries across the world.

Covid-stricken countries across the world are urgently vaccinating their populations, as the virus spreads and deaths mount.

The United Kingdom has vaccinated 130,000 people since rolling out the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine a week ago, as the country goes into lockdown again over winter to ward of the virus’ spread.

Covid-19 deaths in the United States have eclipsed 300,000 this week, as the first health workers received the Pfizer vaccine after it was urgently given the green light by the Food and Drug Administration.

New Zealand has no cases of Covid-19 within the community currently, and 43 cases within quarantine facilities at the border.

The two new agreements announced on Thursday are for two-dose vaccines: one for 7.6 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, which will cover 3.8m people; and another for 10.72m doses of a vaccine from Novovax, enough for 5.36m people.

BROOK SABIN/Stuff Niue is one of the countries to be offered the Covid-19 vaccine by New Zealand.

The roll out of any vaccine would be subject to passing clinical trials, and subject to the approval of the regulator, Medsafe. The Government said Medsafe had been primed to provide a streamlined approval process.

“We are moving as fast as we can, but we also want to ensure the vaccine is safe for New Zealanders,” Ardern said.

“Never before has the entire globe sought to vaccinate the entire population at the same time. This will be a sustained roll out over months not weeks but our pre-purchase agreements means New Zealand is well positioned to get on with it as soon as it is proven safe to do so.”",https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/coronavirus/123736995/new-zealand-to-purchase-covid19-vaccines-for-pacific-island-neighbours-including-samoa-and-tonga
‘Saint’ Dolly Parton part-funded Moderna’s promising new coronavirus vaccine,‘Saint’ Dolly Parton part-funded Moderna’s promising new coronavirus vaccine,1.0,"Watch: Dolly Parton donated $1m towards research for Covid-19 vaccine

In the cosmic balance of the universe, Dolly Parton has long been a force for good: Gifting the world with her award-winning music and philanthropy, and now a vaccine for a virus that has paralysed the world and killed 1.2 million people.

Moderna Therapeutics became the second company to report promising preliminary reports from a large trial testing a coronavirus vaccine on Monday (16 November).

For a world anxiously waiting for a morsel of positive news about the pandemic, early trial data from its large, continuing study showed that the Massachusetts-based drugmaker’s vaccine is 94.5 per cent effective.

And you can thank Parton for that.

Moderna’s efforts to clinch a vaccine were funded, in part, the Dolly Parton COVID-19 Research Fund as part of the musician’s unwavering support for the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, according to an article published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

The centre was one of several key players and institutions in public health that have supported Moderna’s months-long bid to contain COVID-19.

As much as there are still months to go before the vaccine becomes widely available to the public – pending Food and Drug Administration-approval and a crucial peer-review – the news that the second potential vaccine was, of all people, partly-funded by Parton became a glimmer of hope on Twitter.

OK, hold up. How and why is Dolly Parton partly-funding a coronavirus vaccine?

When the country music icon was involved in a car accident in 2013, she became friends with Vanderbilt University surgeon Naji Abumrad, according to The Daily Beast.

At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, Abumrad showed Parton the research the university was doing on antibodies to combat COVID-19, and she wanted to help.

She went onto donate a million dollars to the Vanderbilt Vaccine Center earlier this year, which is researching synthetic antibodies that could treat and even prevent the virus.

Afghan translator who saved US lives and helped fellow translators escape danger becomes an American citizen,Afghan translator who saved US lives becomes a US citizen,1.0,"(CNN) Janis Shinwari is celebrating his first Fourth of July as a US citizen.

His journey to the US started on the battlefield in his native Afghanistan. Shinwari, 42, served nine years as a translator for US forces, knowing he was risking his life and endangering his family.

During that span, Shinwari saved the lives of several US soldiers, including one who helped bring Shinwari and his family to the US.

""If I was in Afghanistan -- if I didn't come here, I wouldn't be alive now. I would be dead."" Shinwari told CNN Heroes in 2018.

At the time he recalled his decision to side with US soldiers after seeing the Taliban regime's terror firsthand. Shinwari knew the US needed translators, but he also understood the dangers.

""If the Taliban catch you, they will torture you in front of your kids and families and make a film of you and then send it to other translators as a warning message to stop working with the American forces,"" Shinwari said.

Acting Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli administered the oath of allegiance to Shinwari and his wife on Monday in Fairfax, Virginia. Cuccinelli honored Shinwari for his service and for saving the lives of five American soldiers.

ICYMI: Yesterday, @HomelandKen joined a naturalization ceremony welcoming 20 #NewUSCitizens at our Washington office. Included were Mr. Janis Shinwari & his wife. Shinwari was a translator alongside our troops in Afghanistan & saved the lives of 5 Americans. Congrats to all! pic.twitter.com/CJgrqIiMBb — USCIS (@USCIS) June 30, 2020

During one particularly fierce battle in April 2008 , Shinwari saved the life of Capt. Matt Zeller, an American soldier he had only met days earlier. Zeller's unit was on routine patrol near the village of Waghez in Ghazni province when the Taliban attacked. They lost a vehicle and found themselves outnumbered and outgunned.

In 2018, Zeller told CNN Heroes he was knocked out when a mortar round exploded, knocking him into a ditch. As he regained his senses, he believed he was about to die.

""I was going to make sort of peace with my fate and I was going to go out fighting,"" he said.

What Zeller didn't realize was two Taliban fighters were approaching him. That's when Shinwari, who had been crawling through bushes, shot and killed them. Zeller recalled Shinwari standing above him and saying, ""I'm Janis. And I'm one of your translators. You're not safe."" Shinwari recalled getting Zeller to safety and creating an unbreakable bond.

""Since that time, we become even closer than brothers,"" Shinwari said.

After that, the Taliban placed Shinwari on a hit list that targeted translators working with US troops. He reached out to Zeller to help him obtain a visa to come to the US. Shinwari said he expected the process to ""take a couple of months. But it took years.""

During that time, the 38-year-old Zeller worked tirelessly to help Shinwari. He launched a Change.org petition and reached out to his connections in Congress.

""I just basically asked anyone who would listen, 'Will you help me? I owe this person my life. I'm willing to do whatever it takes. I will cash in and call in whatever favor. I will owe whatever it is that I need to owe. Tell me what it is that I need to do to get you to help me,'"" Zeller told CNN.

Janis Shinwari and Matt Zeller

Shinwari and his family finally obtained a visa in 2013. Once in the United States, Zeller helped the Shinwaris settle into their new home. He helped Shinwari find a job, obtain a car, and guided the Shinwaris through their first year in America. Zeller even set up a GoFundMe that raised $35,000 for the Shinwaris' expenses.

But Shinwari thought about the other translators who were still in danger in Afghanistan and Iraq.

""We are happy. But I'm not happy about my coworkers, about my brothers and sisters that served the US government in Afghanistan and Iraq, and they are still left behind,"" he said. ""I will fight for them, to get them here. And we will not stop fighting. It doesn't matter how long does it take. But I will fight for them.""

So Shinwari and Zeller used part of the money to create No One Left Behind , a non-profit that has helped thousands of combat translators resettle in the US.

The group has since helped more than 5,000 translators and their families come to the US, guiding them through the visa process. The organization provides resettlement and support services upon their arrival, such as finding permanent housing, home furnishings, job placement and language skills.

""I will not stop fighting until I get the last translator what's left behind,"" Shinwari said. ""I promise them that I will never forget about my brothers and sisters that they are still left behind in Iraq and Afghanistan.""",https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/04/us/july-4-afghan-translator-american-citizen-cnnheroes-trnd/index.html
"Peaceful protest in Santa Fe draws hundreds carrying signs, singing","Peaceful protest in Santa Fe draws hundreds carrying signs, singing and almost all wearing masks.",1.0,".......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........

SANTA FE – About 250 people amassed at the state Capitol late Friday afternoon for a peaceful protest, joining hundreds of thousands of people across the country demonstrating against the killing of George Floyd, a black man who died at the hands of white police officers in Minneapolis on Monday.

The demonstration, organized through social media, came a day after protesters in Minneapolis set fire to a police station and other buildings, resulting in the National Guard being deployed. That same night in Albuquerque, police in riot gear used tear gas in a confrontation with protesters and several arrests were made.

A New Mexico State Police helicopter circled overhead at the Santa Fe demonstration.

................................................................

Santa Fe police showed up briefly after protesters took to the streets and marched to the downtown plaza and back, but left soon thereafter. After most of the crowd dispersed, about 50 protesters lingered and continued the demonstration at the intersection of Paseo de Peralta and Old Santa Fe Trail, shouting at passing vehicles, some of which answered back by honking their horns.

“I think everyone has had enough. There needs to be change,” said 17-year-old Abby Bay, one of the people who spread the word about the protest on Facebook. “What happened in Minneapolis, it could happen anywhere, even here.”

Lacking an organizer, several people stepped up to lead the crowd in chants of “black lives matter” and “I can’t breathe,” the latter words spoken by Floyd as a Minneapolis police officer pressed him to the ground with a knee to his neck.

“We’re standing up for the injustices against black people,” said Lonnica Montoya, who led most of the chants.

At one point, Montoya read the names of several dozen black citizens who have died at the hands of police.

Another woman, Amy Linquist, led the protesters in a song called “Somebody’s Hurting My Brother,” which she said grew out of the Poor People’s Campaign.

Protesters also carried signs, some reading “There’s power in Unity” and “Complacency = Complicity.”

Holding a sign that said “I can’t breathe,” Derrick Gomez was one of fewer than a dozen African Americans at the demonstration.

“What’s going on in Minneapolis with the riots and looting, and in Albuquerque with police and their guns, we’re here with just signs,” he said. “We have to stand up for what we believe in.”

Gomez, who grew up in Santa Fe, where fewer than 1% of people identify as black or African American, said he’s experienced racism all his life.

“It’s great to see the diversity here, especially here in New Mexico, where our culture is rich,” he said. “It’s moving that people here do care.”

Gomez said he hoped the protests being held across the country will make a difference and change attitudes about racism in America.

“As long as we continue, they have to listen to us at some point,” he said. “The moment we quit is the moment they win.”",https://www.abqjournal.com/1461021/peaceful-protest-in-santa-fe-draws-hundreds-carrying-signs-singing-ex-the-moment-we-quit-is-the-moment-they-win-said-one-of-the-protesters.html
"'I didn't feel safe': Mayor Ben McAdams describes secret nights on street, in shelter","Salt Lake mayor goes under cover, stays in homeless shelter to get information about growing homelessness issues.",1.0,"SALT LAKE CITY — For four months, Salt Lake County Mayor Ben McAdams has kept a secret.

He's shared it with perhaps a handful of people in political circles — but kept it out of headlines, hoping to avoid the perception, he said, of a ""publicity stunt in the face of human suffering.""

Back in March, just days before he was due by state law to select a third site for a new homeless resource center — a decision he knew would anger thousands of his constituents, regardless of his choice — McAdams left work on a Friday with no money or ID and walked to Salt Lake City's most troubled neighborhood.

Dressed in jeans, sneakers and a hoodie, the county mayor spent three days and two nights walking and sleeping among the homeless and drug-addicted in Salt Lake City's Rio Grande neighborhood.

One night on the street. One night in the shelter.

His experience was ""shocking"" on multiple levels, he said. And while he by no means meant his experience to be an ""expose"" on the Road Home shelter, an important stakeholder in homeless services reform, his stay did shed light on some troubling realities within the 1,062-bed shelter, including:

• Blatant use of drugs inside the men's dorms, including his bunkmate injecting drugs into his arm — though he declined to discuss details about that encounter with the Deseret News.

• He smelled what he assumed was smoke from drugs ""all night long.""

• He witnessed violence — a fight between two men in the dorms, during which a man was dragged off of his bunk and hit his head on the concrete floor.

• He didn't feel safe — and could see why someone would take their chances on the streets in 40-degree rainy weather rather than spend a night in the downtown shelter.

The county mayor has kept his experience private for months. But after the Deseret News learned of the overnight stays from a source and requested an interview, McAdams eventually — reluctantly — agreed to discuss it this week with the Deseret News and Salt Lake Tribune.

His reasoning for keeping it quiet? He was worried it would appear as a ""cheap stunt"" to the press and public.

""I was concerned that it not look like a publicity stunt in the face of human suffering,"" the mayor said.

The purpose of the stay, McAdams said, was not to go undercover and expose the troubles homeless providers face while trying to serve Utah's most vulnerable. Rather, it was meant to help him ""deepen"" his understanding of the current homeless system before he decided which city would house a third homeless resource center.

At the time, McAdams had endured nearly a month of heated public meetings and fury from residents in West Valley City, South Salt Lake and Draper over the thought that their cities would house a homeless shelter — though he and other homeless leaders have promised the new resource centers will be drastically different than the downtown emergency shelter.

McAdams said he felt something was ""missing"" from the hours of public input and even the more than two years he and his team have spent drafting a plan to reform the county's homeless services.

""I needed to see firsthand, to understand the complexity of the recommendation I was being asked to make,"" he said.

The experience ""instilled in me a conviction that we had to move forward,"" McAdams said, during a time when many of his constituents were pushing back against years of effort to reform the homeless system.

""There were many people saying, 'Back away and do nothing,'"" McAdams said. ""Seeing what I saw … was shocking, and I came away from this experience knowing we had to go forward, we had to change the system, that we as a community had kicked the can down the road for decades and just looked the other way.""

Inside the shelter

After talking it over with his wife, who ""was, of course, hesitant,"" McAdams said he left his wallet behind at his county office at 5 p.m. on Friday, March 24. Wearing a change of clothes, he and a county employee — who declined to be named for this story — left on foot to the Rio Grande neighborhood.

He noted that he made an anonymous donation to a homeless providers account for the services he used on those two nights.

Not disclosing who he was, McAdams said he and his employee spent the first night on a street outside the Rio Grande area to ""understand why some people would choose not to go into shelter.""

""It was cold — below 40s,"" the mayor said. When he woke up, it was raining. ""You wonder why people would choose to do that, knowing that there were beds available in the shelter.""

But the next night, McAdams understood why.

The Deseret News learned from two other people that after McAdams had checked into the men's dorms, he saw his bunkmate injecting drugs into his arm. When asked about that incident, McAdams declined to discuss it.

""I don't want to focus on my brief firsthand experience because I know there are people who see the same and worse every single day,"" he explained. ""The things I saw in my very brief time were shocking and reaffirmed my commitment to take action now.""

But the mayor did say in general terms that he saw evidence of drug use, including the presence of what he assumed was the smell of smoke from drugs ""all night long"" while he tried to sleep.

About 20 feet away from his bunk, McAdams also said an ""altercation"" broke out between two men. One dragged the other off his bunk and his head hit the concrete.

People also warned him not to take off his shoes — that they would be stolen if he did. They also told him to use his bag as a pillow because if he didn't keep a close eye on his belongings, they would be taken.

""One person told me to be sure not to use the restroom at night because it wasn't safe,"" McAdams added. The man didn't elaborate, but McAdams said he assumed it was a reference to sexual violence.

""I didn't feel safe,"" he said. ""It was a fairly chaotic environment.""

He added: ""I certainly could understand why people would choose not to sleep there.""

He said if he were addicted to drugs, he would know ""the Rio Grande area is not the place to go"" to kick the habit, adding that ""drug dealing is at every corner.""

McAdams also said he was ""most troubled"" that children were exposed to such conditions.

He told about meeting a young family with a child diagnosed with mild autism. The child was 9 years old — the same age of one of McAdams' kids.

""What psychological trauma is probably inflicted on a child who doesn't know where he's going to sleep or where his next meal is going to come from?"" he asked. ""It deepened in me a commitment that we've got to do better for these kids.""

In the months since McAdams' visit, the Road Home met its July 15 deadline to have all families with children relocated out of the downtown shelter into housing or to the family shelter in Midvale.

Shelter challenges

The Road Home has a no-drugs policy inside its shelters.

Matt Minkevitch, the Road Home shelter's executive director, didn't know about McAdams' stay until the Deseret News informed him about it this week.

When told what the mayor had witnessed — including the drug use and violence — Minkevitch called the events ""unfortunate"" and ""concerning.""

He said the shelter has around-the-clock security that patrols the shelter and screens for drugs before clients are allowed in, and the shelter has ""zero tolerance"" for violence.

""We do our best to make sure that when we find somebody using drugs, we escort them off the property,"" Minkevitch said. ""And violent behavior is something we do not tolerate at all.""

Minkevitch, after pulling incident files of that night, March 25, did find a report of an altercation that security responded to, though it's not clear if it was the same fight that McAdams witnessed.

""It's not uncommon for us to deal with people who are in the throes of addiction,"" Minkevitch said, admitting that there have been incidents when drugs have been brought into the shelter.

""There will always be a margin of error,"" he said, adding that even in secure environments like prisons, people still find ways to sneak in drugs.

""It's unfortunate that it's happening — unfortunate that it's happening anywhere,"" Minkevitch said, noting that the national opioid crisis has created a ""particularly challenging problem"" for homeless shelters across the country.

That night there were likely about 600 men in the shelter — a large number of people for one shelter to manage. Minkevitch said the shelters in Utah are ""under so much stress right now,"" noting that the Road Home's capacity has grown over the years to accommodate demand.

Minkevitch said the correct combination of affordable housing, and substance abuse and mental health treatment would help lift the burden off emergency shelters and help prevent the mixture of drugs and violence with people experiencing homelessness.

Not an 'expose'

McAdams emphasized he didn't ""do this as an expose"" or to start a debate about the Road Home.

""I get that there are a lot of providers who are trying really hard to do good work, and I don't want my comments in any way to be an expose on them,"" he said. ""I think we have a lot of great service providers trying really hard under impossible circumstances to do what they think is right.""

Most of all, McAdams said his experience ""reaffirms the conclusion"" leaders have reached that the current homeless model needs to change and that immediate actions need to be taken to improve public safety in and around the shelter.

Minkevitch said he understands why McAdams would ""be compelled"" to spend a night in the shelter — though it's not something he would encourage for the ""average person"" because it might mean the sacrifice of a bed for a person in need.

""I respect (the mayor) for undertaking this in order to gain perspective to make an informed decision,"" Minkevitch said. ""He faced a daunting task, a very short window in order to make a very important decision.""

McAdams said he walked away from the experience knowing that ""doing nothing is not an option, even if it's the end of me politically.""

He recalled a reporter asking him during a press conference the day he selected the South Salt Lake site whether he felt the situation has damaged his political career.

""I almost broke down in tears,"" McAdams said.

At the time, he had paused before he answered with a smile: ""Yes.""

""I knew when I accepted this task that it would come with consequences for me personally,"" he said. ""But this work isn't about me personally. It's about doing the right thing for people who are in crisis. … If I have to pay a personal price for moving this work forward, it's a price I'm willing to pay.

""I ran for office to make a difference,"" McAdams continued, ""not to have a job.""

This week, McAdams stood by that answer, saying, ""I had a decision to protect myself or to take action to address this problem, and it was one or the other.""

'Woken up'

In the months since, state leaders including Gov. Gary Herbert and Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox have joined House Speaker Greg Hughes in addressing the ""lawlessness"" in the area — a plan Cox, the state's ""point person,"" has coined ""Operation Rio Grande.""

Though the details of that plan have not been unveiled, McAdams sat in on an hourslong meeting last week with state and city leaders to start coordinating an effort that McAdams said he's ""delighted"" to see coming to fruition.

""One of my frustrations at the time was that I felt that I was alone,"" he said. ""Political leaders for decades have kicked the can down the road, and I knew that we had to do something.""

""Speaker Hughes, to his credit, was with me,"" McAdams added, but ""nobody else seemed to care.""

Hughes said he knew McAdams had stayed at the Road Home but agreed to keep it a secret at McAdams' request.

Hughes said McAdams' experience ""opened my eyes"" and was ""absolutely"" an influencing factor in his motivation to step in over the past several months and push harder for better control of the lawlessness in the area.

""It without a doubt informed my approach and my sence of urgency,"" the speaker said. ""It has provided invaluable information for me and has really informed my decision-making process.""

McAdams said he's ""ecstatic"" that the governor has ""finally woken up and realized they cannot sit on the sidelines any longer.""

He just wishes it hadn't taken this long.

Revamping the system, he said, ""can't happen fast enough.""

The Road Home's downtown shelter is under a state-mandated deadline to close in June 2019, when the three new homeless resource centers come online.

Belize Ends Oil Operations in Its Ocean Waters,"Belize, home of the largest barrier reef in the western hemisphere, has permanently suspended oil operations in its ocean waters.",1.0,"Belize, home of the largest barrier reef in the western hemisphere, has permanently suspended oil operations in its ocean waters. The legislation marks the first time that a developing country has taken such a major step to protect its oceans—and all the life within—from oil exploration and extraction.

The new suspension of oil activity marks an enormous win for the Belize Barrier Reef Reserve System World Heritage site, the wildlife that live there, and the hundreds of thousands of Belizeans who rely on the reef for survival.

""Today is a great day for Belize,"" said Nadia Bood, Mesoamerican reef scientist at World Wildlife Fund (WWF). ""Not only has its government listened to calls to protect the Belize Barrier Reef, which only last year was under threat from seismic oil exploration, it has stepped up to become a world leader in ocean protection by ending all oil activity in its waters.""

Ecosystems in the reef have already been damaged by coastal construction, and potential oil drilling posed a major threat. Harmful industrial activities would impact Belize's economy, natural resources and the 1,400 species found in the reef system.

More than 450,000 people from around the world joined WWF's campaign to end oil exploration and other harmful activities in the reef.

A National Treasure



The Belize barrier reef teems with life that will benefit from the new protections. The endangered hawksbill turtle, manatees and six threatened species of shark live in these waters. Vibrant corals abound, and aquatic animals shelter their young in mangrove forests along the coast.

And people will benefit from a healthy reef, too. Belize's economy is built on tourism, so the health of the reef directly impacts the country's future. Tourism alone is estimated to bring in between $182 million to $237 million per year, with reef-related tourism and fisheries supporting about 190,000 people.

""By acting to remove a major threat to the reef, Belize is safeguarding its future prosperity,"" Bood said. We hope today's announcement will encourage other countries to follow suit and take urgent actions needed to protect our planet's oceans.""",https://www.ecowatch.com/belize-offshore-drilling-wwf-2522728566.amp.html

NASA says hole in the ozone smallest since its discovery in 1982,"Hole in the ozone is now the SMALLEST it has been on record since it was discovered in 1982, NASA confirms",1.0,"The hole in the ozone layer has shrunk to its smallest size since scientists began monitoring it in 1982 because of unusual weather patterns in the upper atmosphere over Antarctica, according to NASA.

The hole fluctuates in size annually and is usually largest during the coldest months in the southern hemisphere, from late September to early October.

The latest observations from space have shown the hole now covers less than 3.9million square miles – a record low and almost half as small as it was during its peak at 6.3million on September 8 only six weeks ago. Experts say the hole is usually around 8 million square miles during this time of year.

Paul Newman, chief scientist for Earth Sciences at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center said it is 'great news for ozone in the Southern Hemisphere'.

But he warned: 'It's important to recognize that what we're seeing this year is due to warmer stratospheric temperatures. It's not a sign that atmospheric ozone is suddenly on a fast track to recovery.'

Between September and October, the hole shrunk to around 3.9 million square miles (10 million square kilometres) — the lowest size at which it has ever been recorded

Observations by NASA and NOAA found that the hole reached its peak dimensions for the year at 6.3 million square miles on September 8

By early October the ozone hole can be seen to have shrunk to around 3.9 million square miles. The Dobson Unit can be seen on the left, measuring the amount of a trace gas in a vertical column through the Earth's atmosphere

The hole in the ozone was at its largest in September 2006, when it covered a massive 10.6million square miles

WHAT IS THE OZONE LAYER? Ozone is a molecule comprised of three oxygen atoms that occurs naturally in small amounts. In the stratosphere, roughly seven to 25 miles above Earth's surface, the ozone layer acts like sunscreen, shielding the planet from potentially harmful ultraviolet radiation. It is produced in tropical latitudes and distributed around the globe. Closer to the ground, ozone can also be created by photochemical reactions between the sun and pollution from vehicle emissions and other sources, forming harmful smog. In the 1970s, it was recognised that chemicals called CFCs, used for example in refrigeration and aerosols, were destroying ozone in the stratosphere. In 1987, the Montreal Protocol was agreed, which led to the phase-out of CFCs and, recently, the first signs of recovery of the Antarctic ozone layer. At lower latitudes, the upper stratosphere is also showing clear signs of recovery, suggesting the Montreal Protocol is working well. Advertisement

According to NASA, the 'main ingredient' in the ozone-destroying process is are so-called polar stratospheric clouds.

These relatively rare bodies occur high in the stratosphere at altitudes between 49,000–82,000 feet (15,000–25,000 metres) above the surface.

These clouds provide a surface on which chemical reactions can occur — releasing waste products called 'free radicals' which go on to destroy ozone particles around them.

Fewer polar stratospheric clouds form in warmer weather, however, and they also last for shorter periods of time in such conditions.

This year's warmer global temperatures — aided by unusual weather patterns — have therefore helped to limit the development of these clouds and also given those did form less time to damage the ozone layer.

In turn, this has led to a much smaller ozone hole this year than we have previously seen.

On the surface, the strengthening of the ozone layer would seem to be a promising development — as such serves to better protect the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation from the Sun.

However, the news that the hole is shrinking is not necessarily a good sign — as the process that is closing the hole is a clear product of rising global temperatures.

In years with more typical weather, the hole usually reaches a maximum size of about 8million square miles by late September or early October — before shrinking back down again.

Gases released from man-made processes on Earth are eroding away the layer of ozone gas which surrounds the globe. Holes in the layer mean more heat from the Sun makes it through and down to Earth level, which is warming the surface and oceans

The highly reactive ozone molecule — also known as trioxygen — comprises three oxygen atoms and is a pale blue gas with a pungent smell.

It can be found 25 miles above the Earth's surface, in the stratosphere.

By reacting with high-energy, ultraviolet rays the ozone acts like a layer of sun screen — absorbing the harmful rays in the stratosphere before they reach Earth's surface.

Ozone is created primarily by ultraviolet radiation, when high-energy ultraviolet rays strike ordinary oxygen molecules (O2).

This splits the molecule into two single oxygen atoms — dubbed 'atomic oxygen' — with the freed oxygen atoms going on to combine with regular oxygen molecules to form ozone (O3).

This reaction helps shield the planet from potentially harmful ultraviolet radiation that can cause skin cancer, cataracts, suppress immune systems and also damage plants.

The ozone depletion seen in blue growing over the month of August 2019, pictured in August 7 (left) and August 27

The Antarctic ozone 'hole', which is technically not a hole but an area of depletion, forms during the Southern Hemisphere's late winter as the returning Sun's rays start ozone-depleting reactions.

These runaway reactions involve chemically active forms of chlorine and bromine derived from man-made compounds and take place on the surfaces of cloud particles in cold stratospheric layers — breaking up ozone molecules.

Warmer temperatures mean fewer polar stratospheric clouds form, limiting the ozone-depletion that can take place on their surface.

NASA and NOAA monitor the ozone hole using satellites including NASA's Aura satellite, the NASA-NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite and NOAA's Joint Polar Satellite System NOAA-20 satellite.

At the South Pole, NOAA staff launch weather balloons carrying ozone-measuring 'sondes' which directly sample ozone levels vertically through the atmosphere.

Most years, at least some levels of the stratosphere —the region of the upper atmosphere where the largest amounts of ozone are normally found — are completely devoid of ozone.

Bryan Johnson at NOAA's Earth System Research Laboratory in Boulder, Colorado said: 'This year, ozonesonde measurements at the South Pole did not show any portions of the atmosphere where ozone was completely depleted.'

While this is uncommon, it is not unprecedented. This is the third time in the last 40 years that weather systems have caused warm temperatures that limit ozone depletion, said Susan Strahan, an atmospheric scientist with Universities Space Research Association, who works at NASA Goddard.

The polar solar vortex seen in red over the south pole which was unusually 'wonky' this year

Similar weather patterns in the Antarctic stratosphere in September 1988 and 2002 also produced atypically small ozone holes, she said.

Dr Strahan said: 'It's a rare event that we're still trying to understand. If the warming hadn't happened, we'd likely be looking at a much more typical ozone hole.'

There is no identified connection between the occurrence of these unique patterns and changes in climate.

The weather systems that disrupted the 2019 ozone hole are typically modest in September, but this year they were unusually strong, dramatically warming the Antarctic's stratosphere during the pivotal time for ozone destruction.

At an altitude of about 12 miles (20 kilometers), temperatures during September were 29F (16˚C) warmer than average, the warmest in the 40-year historical record for September by a wide margin.

In addition, these weather systems also weakened the Antarctic polar vortex, knocking it off its normal center over the South Pole and reducing the strong September jet stream around Antarctica from a mean speed of 161 miles per hour to a speed of 67 miles per hour.

This slowing vortex rotation allowed air to sink in the lower stratosphere where ozone depletion occurs, meaning the Antarctic lower stratosphere was warmed - limiting polar stratospheric clouds where the ozone destroying reactions take place.

The strong weather systems also brought ozone-rich air from higher latitudes elsewhere in the Southern Hemisphere to the area above the Antarctic ozone hole.

A combination of these two effects led to much higher than normal ozone levels over Antarctica compared to ozone hole conditions usually present since the mid 1980s.

As of October 16, the ozone hole above Antarctica remained small but stable and is expected to gradually dissipate in the coming weeks.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-7599369/Hole-ozone-smallest-discovery-1982-NASA-confirms.html
Pope abolishes rule that kept church sex abuse cases top secret,Pope abolishes rule that kept church sex abuse cases top secret,1.0,"Pope Francis has issued an order removing the highest level of secrecy covering child sex abuse cases involving the clergy, a move demanded by campaigners as part of sweeping changes to the way the Catholic church deals with such allegations.

Critics said the claim of “pontifical secrecy” was used by accused Church officials to avoid cooperating with authorities.

The measures brought by the Pope on Tuesday change universal church law, requiring the reporting of suspicions of sex abuse to civil authorities and forbidding attempts to silence those who report abuse or allege they have been a victim.

The pontiff decreed that information in abuse cases must still be protected by church leaders to ensure its “security, integrity and confidentiality”.

But the Vatican’s leading sex crimes investigator, Archbishop Charles Scicluna, called the reform an “epochal decision” that will allow for better coordination with police forces across the world and open up lines of communication with victims.

Francis also raised from 14 to 18 the cutoff age below which the Vatican considers “pornographic” media to be images of child sexual abuse.

The new norms are the latest amendment to the Catholic church’s in-house canon law – a parallel legal code that metes out ecclesial justice for crimes against the faith – in this case relating to the sexual abuse of minors or vulnerable people by priests, bishops or cardinals. In this legal system, the worst punishment a priest can incur is being defrocked, or dismissed from the clerical state.

Pope Benedict XVI had decreed in 2001 that these cases must be dealt with under “pontifical secret”, the highest form of secrecy in the church. The Vatican had long insisted that such confidentiality was necessary to protect the privacy of the victim, the reputation of the accused and the integrity of the canonical process.

However, such secrecy also served to keep the scandal hidden, prevent law enforcement from accessing documents and silence victims, many of whom often believed that “pontifical secret” prevented them from going to the police to report their priestly abusers.

While the Vatican has long tried to insist this was not the case, it also never mandated that bishops and religious superiors report sex crimes to police, and in the past has encouraged bishops not to do so.

"Jimmy Carter's Solar Panels Power Plains, Georgia",Jimmy Carter Put Solar Panels on His Farmland and They're Now Powering Half of His Georgia Hometown,1.0,"Where the former president used to grow crops, 3,852 solar panels were put up to capture the Georgia sunlight, providing more than 50 percent of Plains' energy

Jimmy Carter Put Solar Panels on His Farmland and They're Now Powering Half of His Georgia Hometown

While Jimmy Carter was in the White House, he championed new energy and became the first president to use solar panels to power portions of the building. That legacy has continued decades later and in a place much closer to Carter’s home — literally: Since 2017, the nation’s 39th president has used 10 acres of his farmland to power most of his hometown in Plains, Georgia.

Where the famed peanut-farming president used to grow crops like nuts and soybeans, 3,852 solar panels now stand to capture the Georgia sunlight, providing more than 50 percent of the small town’s energy.

Get push notifications with news, features and more.

The former president told the Sierra Club in 2017, soon after the panels were installed, that on a good day they could provide 1.3 megawatts — or 1.3 million watts. According to the U.S. government, one megawatt will provide enough energy to power 400-900 homes (though watts harnessed by solar panels provides a little less).

According to SolAmerica, the company that first reached out to Carter about the idea and worked alongside him to install the panels on his farmland, the nearly 4,000 solar panels are able to provide more than 50 percent of power to the 727 residents in the small Georgia town.

SolAmerica Energy President George Mori told PEOPLE this week that the solar panel farm remains operational “in its original size” and still provides more than half the power in the small Georgia town.

Jimmy Carter solar panels A reporter observes solar panels lining farmland that former President Jimmy Carter owns in his hometown of Plains, Georgia.

SolAmerica’s partnership agreement with Georgia Power, the state’s largest electricity company, will last until 2042 and it’s expected that the panels will provide more than 55 million kilowatt hours of clean energy for Plains.

“Distributed, clean energy generation is critical to meeting growing energy needs around the world while fighting the effects of climate change,” Carter said in 2017. “I am encouraged by the tremendous progress that solar and other clean energy solutions have made in recent years and expect those trends to continue.”

But the Trump administration has moved in the other direction, loosening Obama-era restrictions on coal and publicly criticizing environmentally friendly energy projects.

In September, President Donald Trump claimed energy-efficient lightbulbs were too fragile and becoming “hazardous waste” after they break. In December, he called windmills “monsters” and eyesores that spit “tremendous fumes” out into the atmosphere.

But Carter isn’t new to being at odds with future presidents over clean energy.

Soon after he left office in 1981, President Ronald Reagan removed the solar panels he’d installed at the White House.

According to Scientific American, those same solar panels are now scattered around the world in museums as a display of the world’s development of more efficient energy. One is in the Smithsonian National Museum of American History in Washington D.C., another is in the Carter Presidential Library in Atlanta and more are in China at the Solar Science and Technology Museum in Dezhou.

While unveiling the White House solar panels in June 1979, Carter left the future of energy to the public’s willingness to embrace it: “A generation from now, this solar heater can either be a curiosity, a museum piece, an example of a road not taken or it can be just a small part of one of the greatest and most exciting adventures ever undertaken by the American people.”

Though Carter’s solar panels didn’t last long at the White House, a University of Oxford study shows clean energy use has risen since the 1960s.",https://people.com/politics/jimmy-carter-solar-panel-farm-powers-plains-georgia/
"Legalising gay marriage caused dramatic fall in suicides across Sweden and Denmark, study finds","Legalising gay marriage is dramatically lowering suicides rates, study shows",1.0,"Being allowed to marry has led to a drop in the number of gay men and lesbians taking their own lives in two Scandinavian countries, according to a study.

A 46 per cent fall in suicides among people in same-sex marriages was recorded by comparing two time periods in Denmark and Sweden – from 1989 to 2002, and 2003 to 2016.

Researchers said that reduced stigma around homosexual relationships was likely to be among the reasons for the drop.

“Being married is protective against suicide,” said Annette Erlangsen of the Danish Research Institute for Suicide Prevention. “Legalising same-sex marriage and other supportive legislative measures – they might actually reduce stigma around sexual minorities.”

Same-sex marriage was made legal in 2009 in Sweden and 2012 in Denmark. The unions are now legal in 27 countries, 16 of them in Europe. Ecuador became the latest nation to permit them, in June this year.

However, people in same-sex marriages still took their own lives at more than twice the rate of those in heterosexual unions across both periods, reinforcing research from other countries that points to a higher incidence of suicide attempts among LGBT+ people.

Young LGBT+ people are at least three times more likely to attempt suicide than their straight peers, according to 35 studies from 10 countries collated by researchers in 2018.

Dr Erlangsen’s study, which followed more than 28,000 people in same-sex unions for an average of 11 years, found married lesbians were 2.8 times as likely to die by suicide as women in straight marriages, and slightly more likely than straight, married men. Men in gay partnerships were most likely to kill themselves.

“There still remains a considerable degree of homophobia, particularly against male homosexuals,” said Morten Frisch, of Denmark’s Statens Serum Institut, a research body. “Just under one in three men still consider it morally unacceptable that two men have sex with each other,” he said, citing a survey of more than 62,000 Danes released in October.

France to make vaccination mandatory from 2018 as it is 'unacceptable children are still dying of measles',France to make vaccination mandatory from 2018 as it is 'unacceptable children are still dying of measles',1.0,"Parents in France will be legally obliged to vaccinate their children from 2018, the government has announced.

French Prime Minister Édouard Philippe said it was “unacceptable” that children are ""still dying of measles” in the country where some of the earliest vaccines were pioneered.

Three childhood vaccines, for diphtheria, tetanus and polio, are currently mandatory in France. Others, including those against hepatitis and whooping cough, are simply recommended.

Announcing the policy, Mr Philippe evoked the name of Louis Pasteur, the French biologist who made breakthroughs in disease research and developed the first vaccines for rabies and anthrax in the 19th century.

He said all the vaccines which are universally recommended by health authorities – 11 in total – would be compulsory.

The move follows a similar initiative in Italy, which recently banned non-vaccinated children from attending state schools.

The World Health Organisation has warned of major measles outbreaks spreading across Europe despite the availability of a safe, effective vaccine.

Anti-vaccine movements, whose followers are known as anti-vaxxers, are believed to have contributed to low rates of immunisation against the highly contagious disease in a number of countries.

A recent survey found more than three out of 10 French people don’t trust vaccines, with just 52 per cent of participants saying the benefits of vaccination outweigh the risks.

✕ Health officials urge vaccines as US faces measles outbreak

There were 79 cases of measles reported in France in the first two months of 2017, mostly due to an outbreak of 50 cases in the north-eastern Lorraine region, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

Between the beginning of 2008 and the end of 2016, more than 24,000 cases of measles were declared in France, official figures show. Of these, around 1,500 had serious complications and there were 10 deaths.

Vaccination is not mandatory in Britain, and around 24,000 children a year in England are not immunised against measles, mumps and rubella.

Fear surrounding the combined inoculation for the three infectious diseases, known as the MMR vaccine, stems in part from a discredited study claiming to show a link between the jab and autism.

The paper, published in medical journal The Lancet nearly 20 years ago by disgraced former doctor Andrew Wakefield, led to a heavy fall in uptake among parents at the time, but exhaustive scientific research has now disproved the theory.

Two children in the UK have died of measles since 2006, and in 2013 a young man from Wales died of the disease – all a “waste of life,” Dr Farah Jameel told doctors at the British Medical Association (BMA) annual meeting last month.

The BMA is calling for evidence to be submitted to the UK Government on “the potential advantages and disadvantages of childhood immunisation made mandatory under the law”.

Beatrice Lorenzin, the Italian health minister, has said falling vaccination rates in the country was “an emergency generated by fake news” and 12 vaccines would be compulsory for schoolchildren aged up to 16.

Cases of measles rose more than fivefold across Italy in April compared to the same month last year, according to National Health Institute figures.

This alarming resurgence of the disease has been blamed on the anti-vaccination stance of the populist Five Star Movement (M5S), which took a quarter of the vote in the country’s 2013 general election.

Norway Announces Total Ban on Fur Farming,Norway Announces Total Ban on Fur Farming,1.0,"Norway has introduced a ban on fur farming. No new fur farms will set up in the country, and existing ones will be required to shut by 2025.

Updated June 2019 | Norway has officially banned fur production across the country.

According to Phys.Org, as of June 2019, no new fur farms will be permitted. All existing farms are required to shut down by February 1, 2025.



News of the prospective ban initially surfaced in 2018. Camilla Björkbom — federal chairman of Animal Rights Sweden — explained the importance of this decision at the time.



“We welcome the Swedish Government’s proposal to investigate the welfare of minkers on Sweden’s fur farms, but today we see that Norway shows that a ban on fur farming is possible,” she said.



She continued, “this is great news, not least for all the animals that are now not born and killed for their fur in Norway, but also because it sets a good example for Sweden and the upcoming Swedish investigation.”

Norway was a large fur producer, with over 300 fur farms breeding and killing over 700,000 minks and 110,000 foxes every year.

“Norway is talking about today’s message to the growing number of countries in Europe who discontinue fur farming. By 2017, the Czech Republic and Germany have also decided to shut down fur farms,” said Björkbom. Both of the aforementioned countries banned fur farming at the beginning of 2017.

What Happens Next for the Fur Farms?

Not everyone is happy about the ban; many fur farmers have stated that they will now lose a large portion of their income.

The Norweigan government, however, has pledged 500 million kroner to dismantle the farms, and 100 million to help farmers move into different fields.

Guri Wormdahl of the Norwegian fur farmers association is still cynical. “Five hundred million kroner, that may seem like a lot but this is not about compensating the simple loss of a job,” they said. “This is about the farmers’ entire livelihood that is disappearing.”

One Liberal MP believes they have the answer. According to Phys.Org, it was suggested that the fur farms could be turned into medicinal cannabis farms instead. Cannabis is legal in Norway if it is used for medicinal purposes; some studies have linked the use of the plant to easing chronic pain and depression.",https://www.livekindly.co/norway-announces-total-ban-on-fur-farming/

Flying could get a little easier after U.S. senators passed a bill to address flying concerns.The legislation bars passengers from being kicked off overbooked planes, a response to airport officers dragging a 69-year-old man off a United Express plane last year.""I think we can all agree that once you've boarded a plane, you shouldn't be kicked off until you arrive at your destination,"" said Republican Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee.The bill also requires the Federal Aviation Administration to set a minimum size for airplane seats and legroom to ensure safety, a nod to the growing number of complaints about shrinking seats.The Senate passed legislation Wednesday that authorizes about $90 billion for federal aviation programs over the next five years.Lawmakers also included provisions to reduce the amount of time that passengers spend going through security checks. They boost the number of bomb-sniffing dogs trained in the U.S. and make it easier for travelers to sign up for expedited security screenings.""What we are seeing is that our airports move much more rapidly when these canines are present,"" said Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash.Airport managers panned the money for airport improvements as keeping airports ""stuck in neutral"" when it comes to upgrading outdated terminals and tarmacs.The vote on the bill was 93-6. It now goes to President Donald Trump, who is expected to sign it.Airline companies beat back efforts from lawmakers to crack down on fees, which they increasingly rely on to boost profits. Lawmakers also nixed an effort to privatize the nation's air traffic control system.Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., voted against the bill because it did not include his legislation directing the FAA to set standards on baggage fees and other fees. His bill said the agency should make sure the fees are ""reasonable"" and proportional to the costs of providing the service.""Congress has missed an historic, once in a generation opportunity to stop gargantuan airlines from gouging Americans with exorbitant fees every time they fly,"" Markey said.Lawmakers also added to the legislation a bill giving the FBI and Homeland Security officials the authority to track and take down drones deemed a ""credible threat"" to people or federal facilities. Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen lobbied for the change. Critics assert that the provision gives the government unchecked power to decide when drones are a threat.Lawmakers said the five-year aviation extension is the longest that Congress has approved since the 1980s and should help airports better plan for the future.",https://www.4029tv.com/article/airlines-cant-kick-people-off-overbooked-planes-under-pending-law-that-brings-sweeping-changes/23585564
"Legal marijuana cuts violence says US study, as medical-use laws see crime fall","Legal marijuana cuts violence says US study, as medical-use laws see crime fall",1.0,"The introduction of medical marijuana laws has led to a sharp reduction in violent crime in US states that border Mexico, according to new research.

According to the study, Is Legal Pot Crippling Mexican Drug Trafficking Organizations? The Effect of Medical Marijuana Laws on US Crime, when a state on the Mexican border legalised medical use of the drug, violent crime fell by 13% on average. Most of the marijuana consumed in the US originates in Mexico, where seven major cartels control the illicit drug trade.

“These laws allow local farmers to grow marijuana that can then be sold to dispensaries where it is sold legally,” said the economist Evelina Gavrilova, one of the study’s authors. “These growers are in direct competition with Mexican drug cartels that are smuggling the marijuana into the US. As a result, the cartels get much less business.”

The knock-on effect is a reduction in levels of drug-related violence. “The cartels are in competition with one another,” Gavrilova explained. “They compete for territory, but it’s also easy to steal product from the other cartels and sell it themselves, so they fight for the product. They also have to defend their territory and ensure there are no bystanders, no witnesses to the activities of the cartel.

“Whenever there is a medical marijuana law we observe that crime at the border decreases because suddenly there is a lot less smuggling and a lot less violence associated with that.”

While the Mexican cartels smuggle other drugs such as cocaine, heroine and metamphetamine across the border, the market for marijuana is the largest drug market in the US and the one from which the cartels can make the fattest profit. It costs around $75 to produce a pound of marijuana in Mexico, which can then be sold on for $6,000 depending on the quality.

Gavrilova, along with fellow researchers Takuma Kamada and Floris Zoutman, studied data from the FBI’s uniform crime reports and supplementary homicide records covering 1994 to 2012. They found that among the border states the effect of the change in law was largest in California, where there was a reduction of 15% in violent crime, and weakest in Arizona, where there was a fall of 7%. The crimes most strongly affected were robbery, which fell by 19%, and murder, which dropped by 10%. Homicides specifically related to the drug trade fell by an astonishing 41%.

The authors claim their study provides new insights into methods to reduce violent crime related to drug trafficking. But its publication comes as the US attorney general, Jeff Sessions, is rescinding the Obama-era policy that ushered in the medical marijuana laws.

“When the effect on crime is so significant, it’s obviously better to regulate marijuana and allow people to pay taxes on it rather than make it illegal,” Gavrilova said. “For me it’s a no brainer that it should be legal and should be regulated, and the proceeds go to the Treasury.”

More than 20 states across the US have implemented medical marijuana laws so far. In those that have, there is now one marijuana dispensary for every six regular pharmacies.

The study suggests that the full legalisation of marijuana in Colorado and Washington will have an even stronger impact on the drug trade as large-scale marijuana production facilities are erected in these states, further threatening the position of drug cartels.

Anecdotal evidence suggests the cartels are now trying to get into the legal marijuana business in California by opening their own farms. Others are turning to human trafficking and kidnapping to shore up their falling profits. There are also reports that some cartels are switching to new forms of drug cultivation by growing poppies in Mexico to produce their own heroin rather than importing it from Afghanistan.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/14/legal-marijuana-medical-use-crime-rate-plummets-us-study
Indianapolis boy cured of sickle cell disease after stem cell transplant,Indianapolis boy cured of sickle cell disease after stem cell transplant,1.0,"Elliot Preddie was born with sickle cell disease, an inherited blood disease which leads to blockages that prevent blood from reaching parts of the body.

INDIANAPOLIS — Elliot Preddie isn’t your average 12-year-old boy.

“He just couldn’t enjoy life as a kid,” said his mom, Tremesha.

Elliot was born with sickle cell disease, an inherited blood disease which leads to blockages that prevent blood from reaching parts of the body.

We first met Elliot last year at Riley Hospital for Children at IU Health.

“Because of sickle cell, Elliot was always a kid who struggled with energy level and stamina and he got dehydrated very easily,” his mom said.

He was getting a stem cell transplant from a matching donor.

“When I was younger, I played sports a lot, but then I got too cold from my sickle cell. That’s why I started quitting all my sports. My baseball and soccer,” Elliot said as he sat on his back porch next to his family.

One year later, Elliot is now free of sickle cell disease.

“I’m really thankful that things are getting back to some sense of normalcy for all of us,” said Elliot’s father, Terry.

Elliot’s doctor said he will continue to be monitored.

“Now it’s at a point where he’s really just coming in for monthly checks with our stem cell transplant team,” said Dr. Seethal Jacob, the sickle cell program director at Riley.

Jacob said the challenge was finding matching bone marrow and matching blood donors.

“Elliott was on chronic blood transfusions every month before he went to transplant and he really needed blood that matched him well enough so that he would not react to it,” said Jacob.

About 3,000 Americans die each year because they can’t find a matching donor. African-Americans have about a 25 percent chance of finding an unrelated donor, compared to about 75 percent of whites.

Elliot’s 4-year-old brother Carter was also born with sickle cell disease.

“The way it shows up in Carter is massively different from the way that it used to show up in Elliot. He largely maintains. He’s done well with his one or two maintenance medications that he takes. He does have severe pain episodes, but they are not so common that we’re at a place where it makes more sense for us to risk stem cell for him,” Tremesha said.

Carter continues to go to Riley for checkups.

His mother said she’ll continue to push for more funding and education about the disease, especially what’s called the ""sickle cell trait"" – something she didn’t know she had until she was five months pregnant with Elliot.

Both parents must have the sickle cell trait in order to pass the disease on to their children. Terry and Tremesha said sickle cell trait is often misunderstood or mistreated.

“I could not get a lot of doctors to believe me that I was having pain, even though I had very visible evidence of a pain crisis on several occasions. The assumption is, ‘Oh you have (sickle cell) trait, so there’s no complications,’ but that’s not necessarily true,” Terry said.

The Preddies said some people don’t know they have it.

“I’m hoping that as research keeps progressing, people look into trait,” Terry said.

As for Elliot, he said he can’t wait to get back to playing the sports he once loved.

“His future is really bright in ways that it wasn’t potentially before,” Tremesha said.

“I’m hoping I can play one of them again,” said Elliot.",https://www.wwltv.com/article/news/health/indianapolis-boy-cured-of-sickle-cell-disease-after-stem-cell-transplant/531-2dbfe316-afd9-4ba5-a404-380687a15db0
Steph and Ayesha Curry Have Quietly Served Up 15 Million Meals During the Pandemic,Steph and Ayesha Curry Have Quietly Served Up 15 Million Meals During the Pandemic,1.0,"We need to be talking more about how the Bay Area’s premier basketball glam couple have teamed up with chef José Andrés to serve more than 15 million free meals to families in need since COVID-19 hit.

We are very big fans of the off-court charitable exploits of Steph and Ayesha Curry (though admittedly, bigger fans of Riley Curry). So we thought it was awfully cool last April when the Chronicle reported that the Currys foundation Eat.Learn.Play. was serving 300,000 meals a week to East Bay families in need, and had hit the million-meal milestone. So now, nearly a year later, we had to wonder… are they still doing that?

#Ad

Together, we were able to place community at the heart of our work and serve well over 15 million meals.



Here are some of #EatLearnPlay’s favorite moments from 2020. Comment down below with your favorite #EatLearnPlay moment! pic.twitter.com/AkI2qmM4cz — Eat. Learn. Play. Foundation (@eatlearnplay) January 6, 2021

Oh, are they still doing that. The foundation has now served “well over 15 million meals” by their own telling. The foundation is one of those programs that essentially pays struggling restaurants or food-adjacent businesses to prepare free meals for families and the underemployed, and according to their recently released 2020 fourth quarter update, the program has “$20 million to put back into the local economy,” and led to the rehiring of more than 900 Oakland restaurant workers.

Can this story of Bay Area basketball royalty feeding millions of hungry people during a pandemic possibly get any more squee and uplifting? Add a dash of johnny-on-the-spot hero chef José Andrés, and yes it can. Chef Andrés’ World Central Kitchen received a sizable grant from the Currys’ foundation to procure meals from “more than 130 Oakland restaurants.”

“It’s like we’re feeding the restaurants to make sure they can feed the community.” says World Central Kitchen’s restaurants operations lead Anna Shova. “Restaurant culture has changed. Popular Michelin star restaurants have now asked ‘What else can I do for the community?’ Now, it’s less about being rewarded and more about being closer to the community. People are opening up their eyes.”

The Currys no longer live in the East Bay (they’re in Atherton now), but it’s great to see them still so involved with the Oakland community. And on that note, Hoodline reported last month Ayesha Curry opened a Sweet July retail store and cafe in Oakland’s Uptown, which bears the name of a lifestyle magazine she founded.

Mall of America takes bold stand by closing on Thanksgiving,Mall of America takes bold stand by closing on Thanksgiving this year For the first Time,1.0,"The nation’s biggest mall has drawn a line in the sand when it comes to opening on Thanksgiving Day.

In the past few years, the Mall of America was among the growing crop of retailers and malls that swung open their doors on Thanksgiving night to stretch Black Friday amid a fierce battle for consumers’ holiday spending.

But no more.

The Bloomington megamall notified employees and tenants Wednesday morning that it is reversing course this year and will close down as many of its operations as possible on the holiday. Nickelodeon Universe and the movie theaters will be closed for Thanksgiving for the first time in its 24-year history.

The mall’s 520-plus stores will have the option to open on Thanksgiving, but mall officials expect few will choose to do so.

“We’ve been talking about this for months, looking at the numbers, looking at the pros and the cons,” said Jill Renslow, the mall’s senior vice president of marketing and business development. “We’re excited to give this day back to our employees so they can celebrate with their families.”

The Mall of America is bucking the trend to open ever earlier on Thanksgiving to get a jump on Black Friday sales.

The decision will affect many of the 15,000 people who work at the mall. A limited number of the mall’s security and maintenance personnel will work since some stores are likely to open and the annual Walk to End Hunger fundraiser will still go on.

By making this move, Renslow said the mall officials hope to “bring that special magic back to Black Friday.”

The mall will officially open at 5 a.m. the day after Thanksgiving, instead of staying open all night as it has in recent years. Executives plan a special “door opening ceremony” and other festivities and giveaways.

It’s too soon to know whether other retailers or malls will follow suit since most have not yet announced their Thanksgiving and Black Friday hours.

Marshal Cohen, a retail analyst with NPD Group, doubts there will be a huge pendulum swing away from opening on Thanksgiving this year since many of big-box store operators are nervous about losing out to competitors that open that night.

“Do I see the rest of the country doing it? No,” he said. “Do I see it going back in that direction? A little bit. I think some stores may realize that it may be an expense they may not want to have, but they’re also afraid to not do it.”

He noted that opening on Thanksgiving Day does not lift overall sales during the Black Friday weekend. It just spreads out the spending over more days. Many stores have begun rolling out “Black Friday deals” earlier in November, which has taken some of the bang out of what typically is one of the biggest shopping days of the year. Plus, the rising popularity of online shopping has diluted some of the frenzy in stores.

Pros, cons of holiday sales

Still, crowds of shoppers have continued to show up for Thanksgiving night doorbuster sales. Retailers said they added the hours because some shoppers don’t like being cooped up inside all day. They would prefer to go shopping with their family after they finish their turkey instead of waking up in the middle of the night to hit the sales the next day, retailers said.

But the phenomenon has also been met with complaints from people objecting to the encroachment into the holiday. Several retailers such as Nord­strom, Costco and Home Depot, which aren’t huge Black Friday shopping destinations to begin with, have received positive buzz in recent years for not giving in to the craze and staying closed on Thanksgiving.

For the past two years, after inching back its opening time each year, the Mall of America encouraged its stores to open at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving when the mall officially opened.

Last year, more than 150 of its stores opened at 6 p.m., most of them staying open through the night. But for many of the mall’s smaller specialty stores, it was a hardship to staff those hours, which was also a factor in the mall’s decision.

It remains to be seen whether the change will affect sales over the Black Friday weekend. About 400,000 people typically visit the mall during the Thursday-to-Sunday period. But officials expect the traffic to be fairly similar this year over the course of the three days instead of four.

“By closing on Thanksgiving, we’re confident we’ll still get those strong numbers throughout the Black Friday weekend,” Renslow said.

Last year, several Twin Cities shopping malls, including Ridgedale Center, Rosedale Center and Burnsville Center, put an end to the all-night shopping hours after seeing crowds dwindle in the middle of the night. They opened at 6 p.m. on Thanksgiving, closed at midnight, then reopened at 6 a.m. Friday. Richfield-based Best Buy also has closed its stores for a few hours between the holiday and Black Friday in the past two years.

But few have gone as far as outdoors retailer REI, which made headlines last year when it decided to close on Black Friday itself.",http://www.startribune.com/mall-of-america-takes-bold-stand-by-closing-on-thanksgiving-this-year/396016881/
Meet the woman who rented hotel rooms for homeless in Chicago during dangerous polar vortex,Meet the woman who rented hotel rooms for homeless in Chicago during dangerous polar vortex,1.0,"A Chicago woman's act of kindness helped homeless people stay warm during this week's dangerous polar vortex. Candice Payne impulsively charged 20 hotel rooms on her credit card before it snowballed into a lifesaving effort by a group of strangers, CBS Chicago reports.

Payne booked the hotel rooms after realizing how life-threatening the sub-zero temperatures would be for the Chicagoans without homes. She posted about it on social media and soon the donations and offers to help bring food came flooding in.

""Maybe they didn't know how to or where to start to help, so I'm glad that I was able to be that vehicle,"" she told CBS Chicago.

On Wednesday, when temperatures plummeted to 22 degrees below zero, a group of homeless people had to abandon their tents near a highway after a propane tank they used as a source of heat exploded. But Payne and other volunteers dug deep into their pockets and picked up the tab for 60 rooms at a hotel on Chicago's South Side.

Volunteers worked together like a family, turning a hotel bathroom into a makeshift kitchen and collecting donations to help replace the items that were lost. And they built lasting friendships even though most of them just met.

Jermaine and Robert, two men who stayed in a hotel room, call Payne their ""angel.""

When they got the offer for a warm bed, they were getting ready to sleep on the street or to be charged with trespassing in their attempts to escape from the cold.

""We don't get that type of help,"" Jermaine said. ""I really needed them at that point, so they came right in time.""

They hugged Payne and thanked her, touched by the unexpected kindness.

""We hear about that on the news and other places but I seen it up close and personal today, and I really want to thank y'all for looking out for our people,"" Robert said.

So far, this volunteer group has been able to cover three nights at the hotel for approximately 80 people. They're hoping to continue working together to help provide a more long-term solution.

Their generosity made sure dozens of people in need had a warm place to sleep when conditions outside were life-threatening. Across the Midwest and Northeast, at least 22 deaths have been connected to the dangerous polar vortex, and winter still has a long way to got.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candice-payne-homeless-in-chicago-candice-payne-hotel-rooms-polar-vortex-cold/
San Antonio pet stores will sell only rescue dogs and cats starting Jan. 1,San Antonio pet stores will sell only rescue dogs and cats starting Jan. 1,1.0,"Animal lovers won’t be able to buy that fluffy bichon frise or affectionate wrinkly sphynx at San Antonio pet stores anymore, after the City Council voted Thursday to allow the sale of only rescued dogs and cats at stores starting in January.

“This ordinance will help drive the pet market toward more humane sources and encourage pet stores to be part of the pet overpopulation solution,” said Katie Jarl Coyle, Southwest regional director for the Humane Society of the United States.

Of the 51 pet stores within city limits, only three sell purebred dogs and cats — Petland Vineyard, Puppyland San Antonio and Royal Pet Palace. The new law also will apply to any future pet stores.

Petland in Leon Valley isn’t affected because it’s outside San Antonio city limits.

Originally, the new rules were to take effect in July, but District 3 Councilwoman Rebecca Viagran moved to make the effective date Jan. 1.

“I think this is the correct step moving forward,” Viagran said, citing the numerous stray dogs roaming around the city.

She said more than 17,000 dog and cat carcasses were picked up by city workers from October 2019 to September 2020.

“That is going to continue,” the councilwoman said. “It’s a growth spurt in our community that needs to be handled.”

Her motion was approved, with dissents coming from council members Jada Andrews-Sullivan of District 2, John Courage of District 9, Shirley Gonzales of District 5 and Clayton Perry of District 10.

The ordinance itself was approved with just one “no” vote, from Gonzales. District 4 Councilwoman Adriana Rocha Garcia was not present for either vote.

“I just don’t see how the ordinance really gets to the source of the problems that we have here in San Antonio,” Gonzales said. “We know we have overpopulation, there’s no doubt. We know that we have problems with loose dogs. … We have a severe problem with pet ownership responsibility.”

On ExpressNews.com: San Antonio pet stores may soon be prohibited from selling dogs and cats provided by breeders

Animal Care Services conducted a survey in July 2019 and February of this year, getting input from the public. The council received 243 written comments in support of the ordinance and 54 against.

Residents from animal rescue organizations and representatives of local pet stores spoke at Thursday’s council meeting. All agreed they want to stop puppy mills but disagreed on how to achieve that.

Petland Vineyard owner David Moreno said the ordinance would not have the intended effect of putting an end to bad breeders and would instead drive irresponsible breeders underground.

But rescue organizations noted roaming dogs and cats taken to city shelters are sometimes euthanized because of lack of space and that requiring pet stores to sell rescued dogs and cats would give another outlet for those animals to find homes.

“We do not have a shortage of dogs and puppies,” said Julianne Marchbanks, founder of God’s Dogs Rescue.

Residents can still purchase purebred dogs and cats from private licensed breeders.

Under the changes approved Thursday, all dogs and cats sold by pet stores in San Antonio must be sterilized, microchipped and immunized.

The council also increased the penalty for selling dogs or cats at flea markets, on the side of roads or online from $100 to $500 for first-time offenses. Animal lovers also will be prohibited from leaving out food for free feeding of feral cat colonies that could contribute to attracting nuisance wildlife. Food must be in nondisposable bowls, and it can’t be food for several days.

More than 380 cities across the U.S. already have restrictions on the retail sale of dogs and cats. In Texas, Austin, Waco, Fort Worth, El Paso and The Colony — a suburb of Dallas — ban all retail sales of dogs and cats at pet stores.

“While other Texas cities have passed ordinances outlawing all pet sales, the proposed amendments do not prevent pet stores from selling and making a profit from dogs sourced from shelters and rescues,” the Humane Society’s Coyle noted.

On ExpressNews.com: Animal Care Services says service calls and intakes are down amid coronavirus in San Antonio

Polly’s Pets in Universal City stopped selling dogs and cats from breeders in 2013. Instead, it acquires rescues from Animal Care Services and has sold nearly 1,000 rescue puppies, according to owner Randy Housely.

Animal Care Services Director Heber Lefgren said that “even good pet stores who are wanting to do the right things oftentimes find themselves along the way realizing that they have been dealing with some of the bad actors.”

Many breeders are licensed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, but Lefgren said these standards are minimal. USDA breeders, he said, are allowed to “confine a dog into a cage for its life that is 6 inches more than the size of the pet.”

District 8 Councilman Manny Paláez said that “this policy can better foster the adoption of animals in our community, diminish the amount of stray animals in our neighborhoods and potentially increase our already high live release rate.”

“It is critical to note that commercial operations that sell cats and dogs can continue the practice,” he said. “Only now they will do so by sourcing from shelters and rescue organizations instead of fueling an industry that too often overlooks animal welfare in the pursuit of profit.”

Opponents of the ordinance argued that these pet stores offer residents the ability to choose a pet that is the best fit for their specific needs. Others said rescue organizations are too stringent, even biased, in making adoption decisions.

Albert Sardinas of Seattle, who was at the council meeting Thursday representing Puppyland, said he sought a husky as an emotional support animal for his daughter. He said shelter staff in Seattle wouldn’t approve the adoption because they deemed her circumstances “not good enough.”

“Prohibiting pet stores from only selling animals sourced from rescues is not going to fix San Antonio’s stray animal problem,” he said.

Paula Sardinas, Albert Sardinas’ wife, said that “there is a documented case of structural and systemic racism in the pet rescue industry.” She’s president of FMS Global Strategies, a government relations consultant that represents Puppyland.

Peláez took exception to the Sardinas’ claims. “Our Animal Care Services department is operated by men and women of color, of all colors and all creeds,” Peláez said. “To suggest our animal adoption operations prefer one race over another really slanders the compassionate and hardworking men and women who work around the clock to help find these animals their forever homes.”

Councilwoman Andrews-Sullivan asked for a report breakdown of the adoption application approvals and denials based on geographical and demographical area.

As a resident of District 2, Andrews-Sullivan said, it was very difficult to adopt an animal “until my kids were just given one.”

“We know families that are marginalized have not really been able to step up to adopt because they may not have a house and they may not have a yard or they may not have the means to keep insurance or they may not have the means to take that animal to a vet, but I still think that they should be able to have a forever friend,” Andrews-Sullivan said.

The world’s largest fur auction house says it will close its doors for good within the next three years, in yet another dramatic setback for this cruel trade that contributes to unnecessary suffering and death for millions of animals worldwide each year.

Kopenhagen Fur, founded in 1930, acts as a broker for fur pelts produced in Denmark, where it is based, and around the world. As we’ve been reporting, the past few years have seen steep drops in pelt prices and stockpiles left unsold at fur auctions and against this backdrop, news of the closure appears as imminent as it is welcome.

The announcement also comes on the heels of rising coronavirus infections reported among mink in a number of countries, including Denmark, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and the United States. Denmark last week said it would slaughter all 15 million mink on its 1,000 mink fur farms in the country following concerns that a mutation in the virus that has infected the mink could possibly interfere with the effectiveness of a vaccine for humans—a concern confirmed this week by a report from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

The Netherlands, after killing millions of mink on its fur farms, announced it will move up its deadline to close them all by two years, to 2021. France recently announced it will phase out fur farming. And last month, Israel became the first country to announce it will ban the fur trade.

One U.S. state, California, has already banned the sale of fur products, and earlier this month, the town of Wellesley, Massachusetts, passed a similar ban. With realistic, manmade alternatives to fur easily available, major fashion designers, retailers and consumers are also increasingly turning away from this commodity. Ending the use of fur in fashion is our priority and we are stepping up our efforts to send it, as quickly as possible, into the annals of history.",https://blog.humanesociety.org/2020/11/worlds-largest-fur-auction-house-will-close-as-demand-for-animal-pelts-drops.html
Mexico jaguar population grows 20% in eight years,Mexico jaguar population grows 20% in eight years,1.0,"Two jaguar cubs are pictured at the ""Reino Animal"" zoo in Teotihuacan, Mexico state, on April 27, 2018; the country's wild jaguar population currently stands at 4,800, a 20 percent increase from 2010

Mexico's population of wild jaguars has grown 20 percent in the past eight years, according to a study released Thursday, a bit of good news for an iconic species whose numbers have been declining.

There are an estimated 4,800 jaguars in Mexico, found the study, carried out by a consortium of institutions and academics with remotely activated cameras triggered by sensors.

That was a 20-percent increase from the first edition of the study, carried out in 2010.

""The presence of jaguars ensures that these ecosystems function, by controlling the population of herbivores, and is also an indicator of the ecosystems' good health,"" said Heliot Zarza, vice president of the National Jaguar Conservation Alliance, in a statement released by the World Wildlife Fund.

The jaguar, the largest feline in the Americas, can weigh up to 100 kilos (220 pounds), though the ones found in Mexico rarely weigh more than 60 kilos.

The yellow, black-spotted cats are found in 18 countries across the Americas, 90 percent of them in the Amazon rainforest.

There are some 64,000 jaguars in the wild, a number that has been shrinking, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, which has declared the animal a ""near threatened"" species.

In Mexico, however, a conservation program launched in 2005 and overseen by Mexico's national parks service has bolstered the jaguar's population growth, said the lead researcher on the study, Gerardo Ceballos of the Ecology Institute at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.

The jaguar also got a boost on March 1 when 14 Latin American countries signed an agreement at the United Nations on implementing a regional conservation program for the big cats through 2030.

Researchers from 16 institutions and 25 academic groups carried out the study across 10 Mexican states, using a total of 396 cameras.

Outdoor Rec Just Got Its Own Stimulus Bill,Senate just passed the Great American Outdoors Act allocating billions to National Parks and public lands.,1.0,"Earlier today the Senate passed the Great American Outdoors Act, allocating billions to support outdoor recreation in two separate ways. The first is by providing $9.5 billion over the next five years to help the National Park Service and other federal land-management agencies address their maintenance backlogs. Federal public lands are suffering from $20 billion in deferred maintenance costs, with $12 billion of that accumulated by the National Park Service. The second is to mandate that the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), widely considered the nation’s single best funding tool for outdoor recreation, be permanently financed to its maximum allotment of $900 million annually. In March the president called for such a bill to land on his desk.

It’s a remarkable breakthrough at a time when the White House has been hostile to federal conservation and land-management agencies and to the LWCF; Trump’s proposed 2021 budget slashed the Park Service budget by $587 million and allocated just $15 million to the LWCF, a mere 1.6 percent of its allotment. The bill passed by a vote of 73 to 25. Proponents, including the bill’s sponsor, Republican Cory Gardner of Colorado, tout the Great American Outdoors Act as a way to get people back to work after millions have been laid off in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. “Years of bipartisan work have led to this moment and this historic opportunity for conservation,” says Gardner. “Today the Senate passed not only the single greatest conservation achievement in generations but also a lifeline to mountain towns and recreation communities hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic.”

A bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced their version of the legislation in the House of Representatives on June 4, and passage of that version is expected in the coming weeks, clearing the way for the president to sign the bill into law.

“We are going to have to rebuild the economy, and this can be a really big part of that,” says Democratic senator Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, noting that nationally, outdoor recreation contributes $778 billion in consumer spending and supports 5.2 million jobs, yet “our trails and campgrounds aren’t in the shape that they should be, which directly impacts economic activity on public lands and in gateway communities.”

In May, more than 850 signatories representing conservation organizations, local governments, and state and regional tourism boards urged congressional leaders to support the bill. “The Great American Outdoors Act will ensure a future for nature to thrive, kids to play, and hunters and anglers to enjoy,” they wrote.

Established in 1965, the LWCF has funded some $18.4 billion in land acquisitions and facilities constructions over time, ranging from expanding national parks to building bike paths, baseball diamonds, and boat ramps. Every single county in the nation has had a project aided by the LWCF. Yet it has been funded to its maximum $900 million annual allotment only twice in its history and generally averages about $450 million a year. Conservationists have been working for decades to guarantee that the LWCF, which is paid for out of offshore oil- and gas-drilling royalties, be fully and permanently funded rather than have the remainder siphoned off to other government programs.

The portion of the bill that funds maintenance backlogs on federal public lands was originally floated by Trump administration officials. The idea was to help pay down the National Park Service’s $12 billion maintenance backlog with oil and gas royalties from public lands and was written into the Restore Our Parks Act. When that bill was bundled with LWCF funding efforts to create the Great American Outdoors Act, maintenance backlog funding was expanded to include the U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and Bureau of Land Management, in addition to the Bureau of Indian Education. Seventy percent of the $9.5 billion would go to the Park Service, 15 percent to the Forest Service, and 5 percent to each of the other agencies.

Conservationists welcome the expanded bill. The Forest Service alone has a $5 billion maintenance backlog on trails, campgrounds, and other facilities, notes Adam Cramer, executive director of the Outdoor Alliance, a coalition of outdoor-recreation advocacy groups. “Our national parks are our country’s crown jewels,” Cramer says, “but the rest of our national public lands are what make up the actual crown. The amount and diversity of outdoor-recreation opportunities, including hunting and fishing on our national forests, BLM lands, and wildlife refuges, is staggeringly huge.”

For many conservationists, the Great American Outdoors Act has been a lightning bolt out of the blue, sparked by a tweet from President Trump. “I’m calling on Congress to send me a Bill that fully and permanently funds the LWCF and restores our National Parks,” he tweeted on March 3. He went on to give credit to two Republican senators, Colorado’s Gardner and Montana’s Steve Daines, both of whom had visited the president in the Oval Office on February 27 to urge support for the bill. Many have commented on the fact that both Gardner and Daines are facing tough reelection campaigns in states where constituents prize outdoor recreation. (Daines is tied with his Democratic opponent, and Gardner trails his opponent, in the most recent polls.)

At the time, Democratic senator Maria Cantwell of Washington State, a longtime LWCF supporter, wryly called the bill’s emergence “a miracle.”

Lately, there has been bipartisan support for conservation measures. Last year the John D. Dingell Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act, which created six new National Park Service units and 1.3 million acres of wilderness, passed the Senate by a vote of 92 to 8. “Public lands and waters are one of the things that are capable of bringing all Americans together,” New Mexico’s Heinrich says. “I see the economic benefits of public lands being talked about vigorously in smaller communities in this cycle.”

Heinrich lauds Republican senators Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Rob Portman of Ohio, in addition to Gardner and Daines, with being tireless champions of the Great American Outdoors Act, which he says was named “to appeal to the White House.”

Heinrich, who most observers credit with driving the effort to expand maintenance funding beyond the Park Service, explains that while the Bureau of Indian Education doesn’t have a recreation mission, it was included in the bill because, by “historical accident,” the agency was placed in the Department of the Interior, and therefore, he says, “time and again their funding levels get left out. Sometimes you have to deal with the history that puts us where we are.”

Politics aside, the bill stands to benefit every American, especially now. “We are seeing during the pandemic how important walking outside is to people’s well-being,” says Heinrich. “Right now more than 100,000 kids in this country don’t have a park within a ten-minute walk of their house,” he says, noting that the LWCF can remedy that. “The rebuilding can be as equitable as we want it to be.”",https://www.outsideonline.com/2414708/great-american-outdoors-act
"Missouri hunters donated nearly 350,000 pounds of deer meat to food banks this season","Missouri hunters donated nearly 350,000 pounds of deer meat to food banks this season",1.0,"(CNN) Missouri deer hunters donated nearly 350,000 pounds of venison to food banks and pantries across the state this season, the Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC) said in a news release.

The hunters donated the meat to Missouri's Share the Harvest program, which provides ""lean, healthy"" venison to help feed hungry Missourians.

""Hunters started Share the Harvest because they saw a need in their communities and hunters remain the driving force behind this popular program that helps feed our fellow Missourians who are in need,"" MDC director Sara Parker Pauley said in a statement

""We sincerely thank the thousands of deer hunters who support Share the Harvest, along with the many participating meat processors and sponsors who help make it possible.""

The program, coordinated by MDC and the Conservation Federation of Missouri (CFM), was launched in 1992. Since then, more than 4.3 million pounds of meat has been ground, packaged and donated to people in need. The fees to process and package the meat are covered by local sponsors throughout the state.

Florida brewery unveils six-pack rings that feed sea turtles rather than kill them,Florida brewery unveils six-pack rings that feed sea turtles rather than kill them,1.0,"You've probably seen the heart-wrenching photos of the damage plastic six-pack rings can do to marine life. They tangle the wings of sea birds, choke seals and warp the shells of growing sea turtles.

A Florida brewery has a solution: six-pack rings that can either biodegrade or serve as a snack for wildlife. After years of research and development, the rings - made of wheat and barley - are now popping up in south Florida stores.

Saltwater Brewery, a craft microbrewery in Delray Beach, developed the rings with a startup called E6PR. Troubleshooting and manufacturing the rings was expensive. E6PR hopes other breweries - both small and large - will buy into the new rings and help bring costs down.

Plastic pollution is a big issue for the Gulf of Mexico. According to recent research by Louisiana State University, the Gulf has one of the world's highest concentrations of marine plastic. Each net or bottle dipped into the Gulf by LSU researchers came up laden with plastic.

""We found it every time,"" LSU's Mark Benfield told NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune in August.

Last year, a volunteer beach cleanup on three miles of Elmer's Island gathered more than 170 plastic six-pack rings, along with 4,000 pounds of other trash.

According to Craftbeer.com, E6PR is testing the rings with ""a select group of craft breweries"" but the company wasn't ready to discuss specifics. Time will tell if any Louisiana breweries incorporate the rings.

Birmingham college student walked 20 miles to 1st day of work so his boss gave him his car,Alabama college student walked 20 miles to 1st day of work so his boss gave him his car,1.0,"When a young Birmingham college student's car broke down the night before he was supposed to start a new job, he didn't panic. At least not for long.

Instead, Walter Carr walked. From Homewood to Pelham. All night. In the dark. 20 miles or more.

A Carver High School graduate and U.S. Marine hopeful, Carr walked throughout the early morning hours Friday because he needed, and wanted, the job with Bellhops moving company. He made it to Hoover by 2 a.m. and then to Pelham at 4 a.m.

It was in Pelham that the trek took a surprising turn. Kindness and concern from four Pelham police officers coupled with publicly-posted words of amazement and admiration from the moving company's clients about Carr's work ethic and dedication, led to a massive pat on the back Monday from Bellhops CEO Luke Marklin.

Marklin drove in from Tennessee under the guise of meeting Carr for coffee to personally thank him. That meeting ended with Marklin surprising Carr by giving Carr his own barely-driven 2014 Ford Escape.

""I am honestly blown away by him,'' Marklin said of Carr. ""Everything he did that day is exactly who we are - heart and grit. So far, he's batting 1,000.""

An emotional Carr had just one word when Marklin handed him the keys. ""Seriously?""

All the accolades over the weekend started with a post from Jenny Lamey on Facebook. She wrote that she and her husband, Chris, got up about 5:45 a.m. Friday to get everything staged and ready for the movers. About 6:30 a.m. their doorbell rang and the Lameys found Pelham police officers at their door.

""He proceeded to tell us that he had picked up 'this nice kid' in Pelham early this morning. The nice kid, Walter, said that he was supposed to help us with our move today. It was his first day on the job with this moving company (Bellhops) and he was 'training' today,"" Jenny Lamey wrote Saturday night.

The officer then told the Lameys about Carr's perseverance in getting to work.

""He WALKED ALL NIGHT to get from Homewood to Pelham. Because he needed to get to work. For those reading this that are not local, that's over 20 miles. You could tell how the officer told us this story that he had complete admiration for Walter and by my reaction he could tell I did too,'' she wrote. ""The police officer said they picked him up earlier that morning, took him to get some breakfast and once they checked his story out, brought Walter to our house.""

Jenny Lamey said Carr was welcome to stay until the rest of the Bellhops crew arrived, and even offered him the chance to go upstairs and take a nap until then. He declined and said he could go ahead and get started. So, he began alongside the Lameys until the crews got there.

""We chatted while we were working together early yesterday morning. He loved my kitchen and said that it was exactly the kind of kitchen he would want. He was from New Orleans. He and his mother lost their home in Hurricane Katrina and they came and made their home in Birmingham,'' she wrote. ""I asked him if he was tired from all that walking, and he said replied that he wasn't and that he had a 4-hour nap before he left at midnight. He said he made it (to) Hoover around 2 a.m. and then to Pelham around 4am, that's about when the officer picked him up and took him to get breakfast. He wore black Nike joggers which he commented that he intentionally wore because he knew he had to walk thru (sic) some pretty high grass on his middle-of-the-night trek,'' she wrote. ""He looked at me in the eye and smiled and I felt like I had known him much longer.""

Jenny Lamey also praised the rest of the moving crew, but it was clear Carr left an impression on her. She has set up a GoFundMe account to help him out.

""I just can't tell you how touched I was by Walter and his journey. He is humble and kind and cheerful and he had big dreams! He is hardworking and tough. I can't imagine how many times on that lonely walk down 280 in the middle of the night did he want to turn back,'' she wrote. ""How many times did he wonder if this was the best idea. How many times did he want to find a place to sit or lie down and wait til morning when he could maybe get someone to come pick him up and bring him back home. But he walked until he got here! I am in total awe of this young man!""

She said she made Carr tell his co-workers of his ordeal. ""Walter said, 'I walked.' That was it. Humble. I asked him to share a little more and when he did, the crew was in awe of him too,'' she wrote. ""I don't know that Walter would have shared if I hadn't asked him to.""

She ended her post with this: ""So yes, yesterday we moved. Yesterday was crazy. Yesterday was long and hard and hot. But...Walter.""

Pelham police officer Mark Knighten was the first to encounter Walter that morning. Because it was 3 a.m., and he was walking on the side of the roadway, Knighten stopped to ask Carr if everything was OK. Carr explained to him that he was walking to work, and why, and Knighten took action.

""He was very polite. It was 'yes sir' and 'no sir,''' Knighten said.

Knighten, along with officers Klint Rhodes and Carl Perkinson then took Carr to Whataburger, where they not only bought him breakfast but told him to get lunch to go as well.

Because it was still so early, Knighten said they took Carr to a church because that was the safest place to leave him until it was time for him to be at work.

Officer Scott Duffey was just coming on the clock and his fellow officers told them about their morning. Duffey then went in search of Carr who had already left the church to walk to his job assignment, which was almost in Chelsea.

Duffey picked him and drove him to the Lamey's house, where he knocked on the door and explained the situation.

Carr plans to graduate from Lawson State in December with an associate's degree in health sciences. He wants to join the U.S. Marines and then come back to Birmingham to get his bachelor's degree in physical therapy.

Carr said he is so thankful for all who stepped in. ""This was the first job in a long time to give me an opportunity to get hired,'' he said. ""I wanted to show them I got the dedication. I said I'm going to get to this job one way or another.''

""I want people to know this - no matter what the challenge is, you can break through the challenge. Nothing is impossible unless you make it impossible,'' he said. ""You can do anything you set your mind to. I've got God by my side. I'm really emotional right now trying to hold back the tears.""

Carr said his mother and father raised him to help others, and he plans to use his new car to do just that. ""To my parents, thank you for being there for me, for the hard work and dedication they put in to keep me on the right path,'' he said. ""And I want to thank God because without Him I wouldn't be here.""

""God blessed me to be a blessing,'' he said. ""Whatever challenges God puts in front of me I know its for a reason.""

Jenny Lamey also was emotional on Monday. She hugged Carr tightly and told him this: ""You've changed all of our lives Walter. You have no idea how many lives you've changed and inspired. You're a very special young man and you're going to do great things. You already are.""",https://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2018/07/former_marine_walked_20_miles.html

These were just some of the monuments and buildings symbolizing centuries of systemic racism in America that were hit during the weekend’s protests, following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25.

Windows were also broken, but the fire was eventually extinguished, according to local reports. Two hundred miles up I-95 North, in Richmond, Virginia, the national headquarters of the United Daughters of the Confederacy was also set on fire.

The UDC and its brother group, the Sons of Confederate Veterans, were responsible for the lion’s share of Confederate monuments built across the country in the late 19th and 20th centuries. The UDC has built over 400 Confederate monuments on public land alone,

according to a 2016 report by the Southern Poverty Law Center

.

Protesters in Richmond also tagged a statue of Confederate general Robert E. Lee, while people in Birmingham, Alabama, succeeded in pulling down a statue of Charles Linn, one of the city’s founders and a captain in the Confederate Navy.

In Philadelphia, a statue honoring former police commissioner and Mayor Frank Rizzo has been at the center of controversy for years. Over the weekend it was defaced, and protesters set fire to it and attempted to pull it down. As commissioner Rizzo ordered raids and strip searches of Black Panther Party members, and as mayor he once urged his supporters to “vote white” for a change to the Philadelphia city charter that would allow him to run for a third term.

Though the Rizzo statue didn’t come down yesterday, Philadelphia officials promised it would within the next month. “It's time,” city council member Helen Gym tweeted. “Almost three years after Charlottesville, the Rizzo statue will come down - and the fight for greater justice must continue.”",https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/n7wbxk/confederate-statues-and-other-symbols-of-racism-all-over-the-country-were-destroyed-by-protesters-this-weekend
"In tribute of Stephen Hawking, EVE Online pilots lit beacons all across its galaxy","In tribute of Stephen Hawking, EVE Online pilots are lighting beacons all across its galaxy",1.0,"Science fiction owes a great deal to Stephen Hawking. His groundbreaking theories in astrophysics and cosmology helped cement our understanding of everything from black holes to relativity. And when he passed away at the age of 76, players in the EVE Online community decided to recognize his contributions to science in their own way by covering the night sky in beacons.

Called cynosural beacons, these modules emit a bright, radiant light and are used to open jump bridges that ships can use as a warp destination. On a normal day, seeing a cynosural beacon flare up is reason to panic—it often signals the cavalry has arrived to obliterate you. But yesterday and today, the beacons are appearing all across space as tribute to Hawking and his achievements.

The passing of Hawking has even inspired one pilot to travel to the system of Molea, the location of EVE's own player-run graveyard , where they plan on leaving a memorial for him.

Thanks to a Reddit thread by 'kairiola,' pilots all across New Eden began lighting beacons at 22:00 UTC, with many staying lit for hours. Due to in-game rules, cynosural beacons can only be lit in null-sec and low-sec areas of space, where there's no real NPC police force to protect you. The image below is a heat map of New Eden showing the density of cynosural beacons, with massive colorations representing hundreds of lit beacons.

Here are some actual in-space shots of beacons lit all around New Eden. If you're having trouble identifying them, they look like distant galaxies.",https://www.pcgamer.com/in-tribute-of-stephen-hawking-eve-online-pilots-are-lighting-beacons-all-across-its-galaxy/
Seth MacFarlane Donates $1M to Irwin Family Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital,Seth MacFarlane Donates $1M to Irwin Family Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital,1.0,"Seth MacFarlane has donated one million dollars to the Crocodile Hunter Family Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital, and the money will be directly used to build a new Koala Intensive Care Ward to bring aid to more injured koalas in need of care. After the devastating bushfires in Australia reportedly killed upwards of a billion animals of all types and injured countless more, celebrities like Chris Hemsworth, Pink, and Elton John have been donating time and money to assist with the relief efforts. Now, with MacFarlane's donation, another million dollars will go directly towards helping many displaced and injured koalas.

On Kangaroo Island alone, tens of thousands of koalas are feared dead or homeless. Because of their slow moving nature and the destruction of their food source, koalas are among the animals who've been affected the most by the Australian bushfires. Thanks to MacFarlane's donation to the Irwin Family, many more of them will be able to receive proper care from professionals as well, and the zoo hospital expansion has even been named in part after the Family Guy creator to thank him for the contribution.

""A huge thanks to Seth MacFarlane for donating a million dollars to the Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital to help with the influx of patients affected by drought and bushfire!"" the zoo's Wildlife Warriors account posted on Twitter, along with a photograph of the new ward's exterior design. The statement goes on to add: ""We're so pleased to announce that we will be naming our new Koala Intensive Care Ward in recognition of Seth's generosity. Plans for the Perry MacFarlane Intensive Care Ward are well underway and we'll soon begin construction on this crucial expansion to the hospital.""

Bindi Irwin, Steve ""The Crocodile Hunter"" Irwin's daughter, has also thanked MacFarlane for the donation with a post on Twitter of her own. ""On behalf of all wildlife, thank you so much for your support Seth MacFarlane. You are an extraordinary Wildlife Warrior,"" Irwin says in the post. The term Wildlife Warrior comes from the Irwin family's conservationist organization, which was originally established by Steve and his wife, Terri, in 2002. Following Steve's untimely passing in 2006, Bindi became the new public face of the organization at the age of nine.

Since the establishment of the Australia Zoo Wildlife Hospital, over 90,000 injured animals have been treated in the building. The bushfires obviously brought in a massive increase of affected animals needing care, and the Irwins and the other staff at the Australia Zoo and in other Australian facilities have been doing their best to save as many as they can. With limited space and resources, these kinds of charitable donations are crucial as they can literally make the difference between life or death for these koalas and other suffering animals.

There's been no shortage of terrible news in the press lately, and stories like this can feel like a ray of sunshine poking through the darkness. Credit goes to MacFarlane and everyone else who's contributed anything at all to the relief efforts of the horrible Australian bushfires. You can take a look at the tweets from Wildlife Warriors and Bindi Irwin below.

"Snow leopards sighted for first time ever in eastern Tibet, report says",Snow leopards sighted for first time ever in eastern Tibet,1.0,"Snow leopards were captured on film for the first time ever in eastern Tibet with the help of remote infrared cameras, Chinese media reported Monday.

""We have captured images of baby leopards with their mother, which indicates a certain quantity of the rare species live in the region,"" Zhao Xiang, head of the Shan Shui Conservation Center, told the Xinhua news agency.

The cameras were set up in the Nujiang River Valley, also known as the Nu River. It is home to one of Asia's last ""wild rivers"" unencumbered by dams or other projects, according to the U.S.-based non-profit environmental group International Rivers.

The presence of the leopards may be a sign that local conservation efforts are working, Xinhua said.

Snow leopards are classified as a ""vulnerable"" species by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, which estimates there are between 2,500 and 10,000 left in the world.

Because snow leopards are extremely shy, scientists rely on non-invasive infrared cameras, which automatically snap images whenever they detect a warm-blooded creature passing by. Scientists then analyze the film to identify species captured by the cameras, using spot patterns on snow leopards' coats to track individual animals.

Aldi to give away all its unsold fresh food to 'less fortunate individuals' on Christmas Eve,Aldi to give away all its unsold fresh food to 'less fortunate individuals' on Christmas Eve,1.0,"Aldi has offered to give all its unsold fresh food away to charities and good causes when its stores close on Christmas Eve.

The supermarket chain issued an appeal on social media urging organisations across the country to collect items left over after its branches have shut up shop for the festive period.

A statement issued by the firm says it wants to share products out with groups such as food banks in support of “less fortunate individuals” in order to “prevent food going to waste”.

The supermarket said: “Aldi is offering local organisations the opportunity to receive surplus food from their stores on the afternoon of Christmas Eve.

Recommended British shoppers throw 178 million bags of salads away every year

“As Aldi stores will shut at 4pm on Christmas Eve until December 27, they will have a variety of good quality surplus food products that they will wish to redistribute in support of less fortunate individuals and to prevent food going to waste.

“Aldi is unable to deliver products so it would be essential that your organisation is able to collect.

“They will expect the level of food available to vary, however, estimations of around 20 to 30 crates will be expected from each store.”

The move has earned the store praise from social media users, who urged other big chains to match the gesture.

One of Aldi’s competitors, Tesco, has handed out surplus food from its stores to local charities and community groups since February last year.

Chipotle is the latest company to spend millions on this expensive benefit for its employees—here's why,Chipotle will pay 100% tuition for you to go to college if you are employed by them,1.0,"On Oct. 15, fast-food chain Chipotle announced it would expand its education benefits program. It will now provide employees with the opportunity to earn a degree in 75 different business and technology fields, debt-free.

The initiative covers 100% of tuition costs up front, for eligible employees to earn associate's and bachelor's degrees in fields ranging from cybersecurity to supply chain logistics at the University of Arizona, Bellevue University, Brandman University, Southern New Hampshire University and Wilmington University.

To qualify, Chipotle employees must have worked at the company for at least 120 days and work at least 15 hours — approximately two or three shifts — per week.

The program is run in partnership with Guild Education, a tuition reimbursement and education platform with a list of clients that includes massive employers like Walmart, Disney, Lowe's and Taco Bell.

In 2018, Walmart announced a partnership with Guild Education that would give Walmart's roughly 1.4 million employees the opportunity to earn an associate's or bachelor's degree in business or supply chain management from the University of Florida, Brandman University and Bellevue University. Since then, Walmart has dramatically expanded its educational benefits to include more than 50 programs.

When Guild works with other large companies, they typically ""highly curate"" the types of programs employees can choose from, Marissa Andrada, chief people officer at Chipotle, tells CNBC Make It.

""What's different with us is we've decided to pivot and focus, for now, on business and technology degrees,"" she says.

It makes sense for Chipotle to select those types of programs, she says. ""If you think about those two spaces, it really plays into our growth plan for not only the company but our growth plan for our employees.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/18/chipotle-employees-can-go-to-college-debt-free.html

Betty turned 99 today, and she waxed philosophical ... ""I can stay up as late as I want without asking permission.""

Well, maybe no philosophical, but Betty's awesome!!!

Her plans for today ... feeding a couple ducks that hang at her L.A. home.

As for what's on the menu -- a hot dog and french fries, courtesy of her agent, Jeff Witjas.

ICYMI -- as in the last 80 years -- Betty's show biz career began in 1939.

Most actors and actresses are lucky if they get one gigantic hit during their careers, but after Betty got her first she did not rest. Her role as Sue Ann Nivens on ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" was epic, and the show was one of the biggest hits in TV history.

And, as you know, she followed that up with ""The Golden Girls"" ... she played the character Rose for 8 years and 204 episodes.

Betty's fame has endured to this day. One of the great show biz stories is the groundswell that led to her hosting ""SNL"" back in 2010.

As for where it all began ... Oak Park, Illinois in 1922. She wanted to be a forest ranger but women at the time weren't allowed.

The Koreans who cheer for Canada (and China and Russia and Japan),"The Koreans Who Cheer For Other Countries : 'It’s just sports. It’s okay to support other countries and other athletes,' says founder of 100,000-strong group dedicated to cheering non-local teams.",1.0,"PYEONGCHANG, SOUTH KOREA—It wasn’t long after the Air Canada flight containing Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir touched down at South Korea’s largest airport that the Canadian figure skating duo was greeted by a loud and happy throng.

Who were those people waving Canadian flags and cheering with a patriotic fervour that suggested they carried passports bearing the national maple leaf? Most of them were not Canadians. Some were members of the Korean Supporters, a group of Korean volunteers who plan to devote their Olympics to an unusual mission: Cheering for countries other than their own.

“Everyone else in Korea is going to support Korea. We’re trying to focus on other countries,” said Ki Yang Cho, head of communications for the Korean Supporters, speaking through a translator.

Ki said the group, which has about 100,000 registered members, has been bringing about 200 volunteers to Seoul’s Incheon Airport most days this week to happily fete Olympic athletes and tourists as they take their first steps on Korean soil. They’ve created an assembly line of all-nations goodwill; shortly after Virtue and Moir had their moment earlier this week, members of Russia’s men’s hockey team emerged to a similarly boisterous welcome.

Once the Games begin, there are plans to assign squads of about 100 to 120 Korean Supporters to each Olympic event. The Supporters buy their own tickets and are encouraged to cheer in the native tongue of the athletes they’re tasked with supporting.

“We’re cheering in Russian, English, Chinese, Japanese,” said Ki. “We’re going to have chants. We’re going to call out phrases. We’re going to wave flags.”

Possibly even the flag of North Korea — which is normally illegal to display here given the nuclear-standoff-induced tensions between the neighbours. With North Korea having arrived at the Games with a small contingent of athletes — not to mention a 229-strong cheer squad meant to root for athletes from both Koreas — the Korean Supporters do not plan to let old grudges ruin the spirit of their cause.

“We’re not going to treat the North Koreans as special. We’re going to support them like we do other nations,” said Ki.

The organization was founded by businessman Moon Sang Ju in the lead-up to the 2002 World Cup of soccer, co-hosted by South Korea and Japan. Moon’s idea at the time, he said, was to help improve his country’s global image and to promote world peace.

“The entire world is one family, even if we’re from different countries,” said Moon, 72, also speaking through a translator. “It’s just sports. It’s okay to support other countries and other athletes.”

The 100,000-strong Korean Supporters group is dedicated to cheering for athletes from other countries.







That view hasn’t always been received with universal agreement in Korea, which harbours a sports culture which encourages boisterous and elaborate cheering for the home team, albeit without the violent hooliganism that sometimes mars the endeavour elsewhere. During a World Cup soccer game in 2002 between Korea and Poland in Busan, Korea’s second-most populous city, the Korean Supporters enlisted a squad of about 500 volunteers to cheer for Poland. The story goes that many of the volunteers were swept up in the moment and ended up cheering for their homeland instead. When Korea won, igniting a memorable run to the World Cup semifinal, nationalistic sentiment soared.

“There definitely were times when people actually said we should only cheer for Korea,” said Moon. “When that happened I tried to explain to people our mission. Some of those people became part of this organization, and now they’re cheering for other nations with us.”

The official tagline of the 2018 Olympics goes: “Passion. Connected.” For the Korean Supporters, it’s more like: “Passion. Practised.” The group has its own song and its own dance. It has its own uniform — an eye-catching yellow vest. And Ki acknowledged that it even has its imitators — other groups also plan to cheer for visiting nations at these Olympics, although he said he didn’t know much about them.

The Supporters’ pursuit also comes with its challenges. Ki said it isn’t difficult to find volunteers to cheer for athletes from other countries at popular marquee events like, say, figure skating — where Virtue and Moir, Canada’s flag-bearers at Friday’s opening ceremony, will look to expand an Olympic medal collection that already includes a gold and two silvers. That’s why the Korean Supporters have been focusing their efforts on encouraging members to attend less glamorous events held outdoors — say, cross-country skiing and biathlon. With temperatures expected to plummet well below freezing during the Games, it’s been a tall order.

“Because of the cold weather it’s very hard to make volunteers go to some of those events. But my plan is to have 100 to 120 volunteers at each event,” said Ki.

Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading...

Moon, the group’s founder, said the sub-zero temperatures at what’s expected to be one of the coldest Olympics in history only make his group’s noble mission more necessary. In a geopolitical hot spot, the idea is to warm hearts.

“In the cold weather, being cheered is a very good thing. It makes you happy,” said Moon. “There are a lot of people in the world worrying about nuclear war in this Korean Peninsula. So we’re thankful to the athletes and tourists for coming to Korea. That’s what motivates us to support Canadians and athletes from all over the world. We’re trying to promote a world where there is no war.”

A New Jersey landlord joined “Fox & Friends First” Friday to discuss why he waived rent payments for his tenants for three months during the coronavirus outbreak.

“For us, it’s just good business practice,” said David Placek.

Placek went on to say, “We’re believers that if you invest in the community and you’re good community stewards, that is going to be good for you as a property owner and property investor.”

Placek said that forgoing more than $50,000 in rent payments from tenants was an easy decision to make.

“It was more a question of why not do this for our tenants. We ask them to pay it forward so if they can go out and buy take out from the restaurants or gift cards from the other small businesses or pay it forward to the local food bank we had in Montclair, N.J. called Tony’s Kitchen.”

House votes to end jail time for being too poor to pay fines,House votes to end jail time for being too poor to pay fines,1.0,"Legislation that would make it easier for poor people to satisfy traffic tickets with alternatives to payment cleared the Texas House on Tuesday on a vote of 75-70. The bill needs to be approved by the Senate again before moving to Gov. Greg Abbott's desk.

Senate Bill 1913, by state Sen. Judith Zaffirini, D-Laredo, would allow courts to ask defendants if they are too poor to pay for traffic tickets; fines for other low-level and fine-only offenses; or court costs. After making that determination, courts would be allowed to reduce or waive fines and costs and offer community service as an alternative.

""They're not getting off scot-free. We're getting something for something,"" the bill's House sponsor, Rep. Senfronia Thompson, D-Houston, told members Monday. ""We are filling our jails up with people who should not be there.""

For fine-only offenses, jail time only comes into the picture when someone doesn't pay their fine — a risk borne by thousands of Texans, according to a recently released report by Texas Appleseed and the Texas Fair Defense Project. Those who can't afford to pay often find themselves hit with additional fines or other restrictions, such as being blocked from renewing their driver's licenses and vehicle registrations. Critics call it debtors' prison.

More than 200,000 Texans can't renew their licenses, and approximately 400,000 have holds on vehicle registrations due to unpaid fines, according to the report. In 2015, almost 3 million warrants were issued in cases where the punishment was originally just a fine.

Courts generally don't offer alternatives to jailing or ask about a defendant's ability to pay, the study found. In 2015, judges rarely used community service to resolve ""fine-only"" cases – just 1.3 percent of the time. In fewer than 1 percent of cases, they waived fines or reduced payments owed because the defendant couldn't afford to pay, according to the study.

Legislation tackling this issue has a high-profile supporter in Texas Supreme Court Chief Justice Nathan Hecht.

Jailing a person who can't pay fines and court costs ""keeps them from jobs, hurts their families, makes them dependent on society and costs the taxpayers money,"" he said during his State of the Judiciary speech in February.

"Airline safety: 2017 was safest year in history for passengers around world, research shows","Airline safety: 2017 was safest year in history for passengers around world, research shows",1.0,"In a year when more people flew to more places than ever, 2017 was the safest on record for airline passengers.

The Dutch-based aviation consultancy, To70, has released its Civil Aviation Safety Review for 2017. It reports only two fatal accidents, both involving small turbo-prop aircraft, with a total of 13 lives lost.

No jets crashed in passenger service anywhere in the world.

The two crashes which occurred on New Year’s Eve – a seaplane in Sydney which killed six, and a Cessna Caravan which crashed in Costa Rica, killing all 12 on board – are not included in the tally, since both aircraft weighed under 5,700kg - the threshold for the report.

The first fatal accident included in the report was in October: an Embraer Brasilia operating as an air ambulance in Angola. The pilots lost control after reportedly suffering an engine failure, Seven people died, including the patient.

In November, a Czech-built Let 410 belonging to Khabarovsk Avia crashed on landing at Nelkan in the Russian Far East with the loss of six lives. A four-year-old girl was the only survivor.

✕ Video supposedly shows seaplane flying moments before Hawkesbury River crash in Australia

A much higher death toll occurred in Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan, when a Turkish Boeing 747 freighter belonging to ACT AIrlines overshot the runway and ended up in a village close to the airport, killing 35 on the ground as well as four crew.

In addition, jet blast killed a tourist standing close to the runway on the Caribbean island of St Maarten.

The chances of a plane being involved in a fatal accident is now one in 16 million, according to the lead researcher, Adrian Young.

But Mr Young, senior aviation consultant for To70, told The Independent: “It is unlikely that this historic low will be maintained; in part, these very positive figures rest on good fortune. Nevertheless, the safety level that civil aviation has achieved is remarkable”.

He cautioned: “The risks to civil aviation remain high as shown by the seriousness of some of the non-fatal accidents.” They included, he said, “the spectacular loss of the inlet fan and cowling of an engine on an Air France A380” over Greenland in September.

“That the aeroplane continued to operate safely to a diversion airport and was then flown home for repair on three engines says a lot about the robustness of the aeroplane.”

The report warns that electronic devices in checked-in bags pose a growing potential danger: “The increasing use of lithium-ion batteries in electronics creates a fire risk on board aeroplanes as such batteries are difficult to extinguish if they catch fire.

“Airlines worldwide are training their crews to fight any fires in the cabin; the challenge is keeping such batteries out of passenger luggage.”

In 2016, 271 people lost their lives in seven fatal events. They included the crash of an Egyptair flight from Paris to Cairo which killed 66, and a LaMia jet carrying the Brazilian football team Chapecoense which ran out of fuel in Colombia and crashed with the loss of 71 lives.

The death toll in the two previous years was significantly higher. In 2015, 471 people died in four crashes; they included a Metrojet flight from Sharm el Sheikh to St Petersburg, Russia, which killed 224, and a Germanwings Airbus A320 from Barcelona to Dusseldorf whose first officer, Andreas Lubitz, killed 150 on board by deliberately crashing into the French Alps,

In 2014, 864 people died in five crashes, including the losses of two Malaysia Airlines 777s: MH370, whose fate is still unknown, and MH17, downed by a missile over eastern Ukraine.

The UK has the best air-safety record of any major country. No fatal accidents involving a British airline have happened since the 1980s. The last was on 10 January 1989; 47 people died when a British Midland Boeing 737 crashed at Kegworth in Leicestershire.

In contrast, sub-Saharan Africa has an accident rate 44 per cent worse than the global average, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). In November, Alexandre de Juniac, IATA’s director general, said: “African safety has improved, but there is a gap to close.”

The miners were stuck in the Beatrix gold mine, in the small town of Theunissen near the city of Welkom, for around 30 hours after a massive power outage caused by a storm prevented lifts from bringing workers on the night shift to the surface.

After several hours engineers were able to restore power, allowing the hoist to bring up the miners who had been trapped since Wednesday evening in batches.

Asked if there had been any casualties, Wellsted said there was “no indication so far that anyone has been in distress” although it had been a “traumatic experience”.

Several ambulances arrived on-site overnight, the AFP reporter said.

Nervous family members had earlier patiently gathered along the road to the shaft, kept at a distance by security guards.

South Korea reports more recoveries than coronavirus cases for the first time,South Korea reports more recoveries than coronavirus cases for the first time,1.0,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea reported more recoveries from the coronavirus than new infections on Friday for the first time since its outbreak emerged in January, as a downward trend in daily cases raised hopes that Asia’s biggest epidemic outside China may be slowing.

The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) recorded 110 new coronavirus cases on Friday compared with 114 a day earlier, taking the national tally to 7,979. The death toll rose by five to 72 as of late Friday.

In contrast, 177 patients were released from hospitals where they had been isolated for treatment, the KCDC said.

This marks the first time that the daily number of recovered people exceeded that of new infections since South Korea’s first patient was confirmed on Jan. 20.

The latest figures are in line with a downward trend in new cases which has raised hopes that the outbreak may be easing in Asia’s fourth-largest economy.

The trend is expected to persist, with more self-quarantined patients being discharged in the coming days, KCDC chief Jeong Eun-kyeong said.

But officials urged vigilance after new clusters of infections emerged at a call center in a crowded part of capital Seoul, and the fisheries ministry based in the administrative city of Sejong.

“We’ve managed to turn the corner, but there are concerns about overseas inflows, as well as possible infections at home around such facilities as call centers, computer cafes and karaoke rooms,” Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said at a meeting in Daegu.

Of the latest 110 cases, 61 were from the hard-hit southeastern city of Daegu where a fringe Christian church at the center of the epidemic is located, while 17 and 13 were in Sejong and Seoul, respectively.

At least 109 cases so far have been linked to the call center, operated by an insurance company whose 800-strong workforce is being tested or in quarantine for monitoring. But the rate of increase in new infections has been slowing over the past couple of days.

Seoul city said it plans to carry out extensive checks on some 10,500 computer cafes and karaoke bars as part of efforts to prevent the spread of the virus in crowded workplaces.

“We assess that we’ve put out a big fire, but cannot lower our guard yet”, Mayor Park Won-soon told a briefing.

Global alarm over the coronavirus intensified, with governments from Europe to the United States unveiling new measures aimed at slowing the spread of a disease that has infected almost 135,000 people worldwide.

South Korea said it will subject visitors from France, Germany, Britain, Spain and the Netherlands to reinforced border checks starting Sunday, after imposing similar rules for China, Italy and Iran suffering a major outbreak.",https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-southkorea/south-korea-reports-more-recoveries-than-coronavirus-cases-for-the-first-time-idUKKBN210051
Andy Samberg And The 'Brooklyn Nine-Nine' Cast Support Terry Crews,Brooklyn Nine-Nine cast supports Terry Crews,1.0,"



Speaking with the Associated Press, comedy actor Andy Samberg expressed his support for fellow Brooklyn Nine-Nine star Terry Crews, who testified about sexual assault and toxic masculinity before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday. “We have a cast text chain and we were all texting him how incredible it was,” he said. “He’s a miracle. Terry’s the best guy. I am proud to know him.”

During his testimony, Crews described “how toxic masculinity permeates culture” via his own example. In November, the actor revealed Hollywood executive Adam Venit had groped him at a party in the presence of his wife and others. Not only was Venit’s punishment minor, but many in the industry turned on Crews. “As I shared my story, I was told over and over that this was not abuse. This was just a joke. This was just horseplay,” he explained. “One man’s horseplay is another man’s humiliation. And I chose to tell my story and share my experience to stand in solidarity with millions of other survivors around the world.”

Crews also revealed that sharing his story had cost him a role in the latest Expendables franchise sequel. Even so, his Brooklyn Nine-Nine colleagues and others were quick to come to his defense. Joe Lo Truglio, who plays Charles Boyle on the series, declared, “So shines a good deed in a weary world.”

FCC proposes new 3-digit number as Suicide Prevention Hotline,National Suicide Prevention Hotline is Getting Its Own 3-Digit Number in the US (988) - A quick & easy Number to remember for help like 911.,1.0,"Washington (CNN) The Federal Communications Commission has proposed a three-digit number for the National Suicide Prevention Hotline: 988.

The federal agency's staff made the recommendation this week in a report to Congress, finding that using a shorter and easier to remember number ""would likely make it easier for Americans in crisis to access potentially life-saving resources.""

The push for change comes as America's suicide rates are at the highest level since World War II, with an increase of 33% from 1999 to 2017 alone, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Annual research published in June by the agency's National Center for Health Statistics found suicide rates among people 15 to 64 climbed significantly during that period, rising from 10.5 per 100,000 people in 1999 to 14 per 100,000 in 2017, the most recent year with available data.

FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said in a statement Thursday that he intends to move forward on the recommendation.

""In the meantime, my heart goes out to anyone facing a crisis,"" Pai said. ""I hope they will contact 1-800-273-TALK for support today.""

Under the rule-making process, the FCC notifies the public and allows for a period of at least 30 days for public comment.

According to the report, the FCC had considered other three-digit options for the hotline, but determined that the 988 number ""could be implemented more easily and quickly than repurposing an existing 3-digit"" number.

Last year, counselors answered over 2.2 million calls and over 100,000 online chats, according to the FCC.

Republican Utah Rep. Chris Stewart, who helped pass a bipartisan law that led to the FCC report, praised the announcement. The law, signed by President Donald Trump in 2018, called for a study to determine the hotline's effectiveness and the best three-digit dialing code for the hotline.

Asking for help The suicide rate in the United States has seen sharp increases in recent years. Studies have shown that the risk of suicide declines sharply when people call the national suicide hotline: 1-800-273-TALK. There is also a crisis text line. For crisis support in Spanish, call 1-888-628-9454. The lines are staffed by a mix of paid professionals and unpaid volunteers trained in crisis and suicide intervention. The confidential environment, the 24-hour accessibility, a caller's ability to hang up at any time and the person-centered care have helped its success, advocates say.



The International Association for Suicide Prevention and Befrienders Worldwide also provide contact information for crisis centers around the world.

""Today's announcement by the FCC is another important step to provide critical resources to address mental health and suicide in our state and country. This will save lives,"" Stewart said in a statement Thursday.

The National Suicide Prevention Hotline was launched in 2005 by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and Vibrant Emotional Health, a mental health nonprofit.

Calls to the current 10-digit number, 1-800-273-8255 (TALK), are routed from anywhere in the United States to the closest certified crisis center. It provides free and confidential support 24 hours a day, seven days a week for people in suicidal crisis or distress.

More than 47,000 Americans died by suicide and more than 1.4 million adults attempted to take their own lives in 2017, according to the Health and Human Services' substance abuse and mental health services agency.

Suicide is the10th leading cause of death in the US, according to the CDC

To get help, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255). There is also a crisis text line. For crisis support in Spanish, call 1-888-628-9454.",https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/17/politics/fcc-suicide-prevention-hotline-number/index.html
Gay couple adopts baby living with HIV after she was rejected by 10 other families,Gay couple adopts baby living with HIV after she was rejected by 10 other families,1.0,"Damian Pighin and Ariel Vijarra with their daughter Olivia (Twitter)

A gay couple in Argentina have adopted a baby that was rejected by 10 other families because she is HIV positive.

Damian Pighin and Ariel Vijarra decided to adopt as far back as 2011, and in 2014 they received a call to say that a newborn baby was ready to join their family, UNILAD reports.

The girl had been born with HIV and had tragically been rejected by 10 other families.

But her HIV-status did not matter to Pighin and Vijarra. Speaking to local media, Ariel said that he knew she was meant to be part of his life as soon as he saw her.

“The connection was immediate. We held her in our arms, gave her the bottle and she looked at us with her eyes wide open without crying,” he said.

Their daughter is on treatment and the virus is now undetectable.

The girl – who is called Olivia – is now on treatment for HIV and the virus is now undetectable as a result.

A year later, a woman approached them and said she had heard about their story and wanted them to adopt her daughter too. They agreed and shortly afterwards welcomed their second daughter Victoria into the world.

The connection was immediate. We held her in our arms, gave her the bottle and she looked at us with her eyes wide open without crying.

The couple works for a non-governmental agency called Acunar Familias which translates as Cradle Families where they help couples adopt children.

The heartwarming story comes just months after a new study, called PARTNER2, proved that there is zero risk of transmitting HIV while on antiretroviral treatment.

HIV is untransmittable when on effective treatment

The study was published in The Lancet in May and investigated almost 1,000 gay male couples who did not use condoms across Europe over more than eight years where one partner had the virus.

Over the course of eight years, just 15 of the HIV-negative men involved contracted the virus – however researchers were able to confirm through genetic testing that none of those men contracted the virus from their partner.

Meanwhile, researchers at Temple University’s Lewis Katz School of Medicine revealed in September that they had “functionally cured” mice carrying the HIV virus.

The mice were given a “long-acting slow-effective release” form of antiretroviral therapy as a part of the treatment. The researchers also used a gene editing tool to extract the remnants of the virus.",https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2019/10/16/gay-couple-adopts-baby-living-with-hiv-after-rejected-by-10-families/
Taiwan to ship Australia 3 tons of fabric to make face masks,"Taiwan and Australia have reached an agreement in which the two countries will exchange raw materials desperately needed to battle the coronavirus. Australia will provide 1 million liters of alcohol for disinfectant, Taiwan to send 3 metric tons of mask fabric",1.0,"TAIPEI (Taiwan News) — Taiwan and Australia have reached an agreement in which the two countries will exchange raw materials desperately needed to battle the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19), announced the Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) on Monday (March 30).

On its Facebook page on Monday, the MOEA announced that Taiwan and Australia have agreed to cooperate on fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. Australia has pledged to provide Taiwan with 1 million liters of alcohol which can be used to produce 4.2 million 300 milliliter bottles containing 75 percent alcohol to be used as a disinfectant.

In exchange, Taiwan will offer Australia 3 metric tons of non-woven fabric to produce surgical masks once Taiwan has reached sufficient domestic production capacity. That same day, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) spokeswoman Joanne Ou (歐江安) said that Australia has been purchasing the raw materials to make masks for many years, while about 90 percent of Taiwan's alcohol supply comes from Australia, reported Liberty Times.

Ou said that in this time of desperate shortages of epidemic prevention and medical supplies, Taiwan and Australia can join forces to combat the disease. She said that the two countries would provide each other with the raw materials at preferential prices.

Ou called Australia an important regional partner of Taiwan, as the two countries share universal values such as freedom and democracy, rule of law, and human rights. Ou said that since the coronavirus outbreak began, the two countries have maintained close cooperation, adding that they look forward to an early end to the epidemic and will continue to deepen their bilateral partnership and trade.

The latest agreement comes less than two weeks after Taiwan's Foreign Minister Joseph Wu (吳釗燮) announced a Taiwan-U.S. joint statement in which the two sides agreed to step up their cooperation on the development of drugs and vaccines to battle the coronavirus. As part of the agreement, Taiwan pledged to donate 100,000 face masks per week to the U.S., while the U.S. is reserving materials for 300,000 hazmat suits for Taiwan.",https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3907578
Shadow of War developer who died of cancer immortalised as an in-game orc slayer,Shadow of War developer who died of cancer immortalised as an in-game orc slayer. Money from selling that DLC will be sent to his family.,1.0,"UPDATE 5th September 2017: Warner Bros. has issued a statement on the Forthog Orc-Slayer DLC, insisting the company is not profiting from sales of it.

""Neither Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment nor Monolith Productions will profit from any sales of the Forthog Orc-Slayer DLC regardless of the territory in which that DLC is sold,"" Warner Bros. said.

While this statement is frustrating in its lack of clarity, it does suggest that no matter which territory you buy the Forthog Orc-Slayer DLC from, Warner Bros. will make its $3.50 donation.

UPDATE 4th September 2017: Unfortunately, WB Games will only donate money to the Forgey family from purchases of the Forthog Orc-Slayer DLC made from most of the states in the US. It excludes AL, HI, IL, MA, MS and SC - and of course outside the US. So if you're in Europe and you buy the DLC, none of the money goes to the Forgey family.

Those who wish to directly donate money to the Forgey family can do via YouCaring.com.

ORIGINAL STORY 1st September 2017: A Shadow of War developer who died of cancer has been immortalised as an orc slayer in the game.

Monolith executive producer Michael Forgey, who died from a brain tumour last year aged just 43-years-old, appears in Shadow of War as DLC character Forthog Orc-Slayer.

If you have the £3.99 DLC, Forthog will on occasion appear to one-hit kill whichever enemy the player character is up against. Think the Mysterious Stranger from the Fallout series.

Forgey, who was married with three children, was a music enthusiast who played in a band made up of Monolith staff called Orc Slayer. Accordingly, Forthog Orc-Slayer wields a devastating guitar axe, which you can see in the video below. (The song was written and performed by Forgey himself.)

WB Games will donate $3.50 of every Forthog Orc-Slayer purchase to the Forgey family through 31st December 2019, Monolith said.

In the video below, Monolith studio head Kevin Stephens and director of art Phil Straub remember Forgey, celebrate his life and explain how Forthog came to life.

""Mike was larger than life,"" Stephens said. ""Mike was an incredible inspiration to our team. He was our front man in many respects. Everybody loved Mike.""

""Mike was a fantastic guy,"" Straub added. ""He was a guy who always wanted to help people. He was a great manager of people.""

The cinematic trailer created by Monolith staff for the Forthog Orc-Slayer DLC was designed to represent Forgey's personality, Straub explained. At the end we see Forthog smirk before running towards a number of enemies, the image eventually concealed by a blizzard.

""He's going to the Undying Lands,"" Straub said. ""He's embracing that.""

You can pre-purchase the Forthog Orc-Slayer DLC on Steam and Xbox One now. He'll be available to buy on PS4 when the game launches in October.",http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-09-01-shadow-of-war-developer-who-died-of-cancer-immortalised-as-an-in-game-orc-slayer
This special ed teacher promised to one day donate $1M to her students. She wasn't kidding,NJ teacher leaves $1 million to school district in her will. it will be used on scholarships for special-Education students,1.0,"DUMONT — About 10 years ago, Superintendent Emanuele Triggiano remembers laughing when a retired teacher told him that she was going to donate a million dollars.

“I thought it was a joke,” Triggiano said. “But then we got the paperwork.”

Genevieve Via Cava, a special educator teacher in the Dumont school district, had amassed a small fortune throughout her life. When she died in 2011, she left her savings to help some of the people who meant the most to her: her special education students.

“She was very kindhearted, sometimes with a rough exterior, but very compassionate deep down,” said Richard Jablonski, a close friend and executor of her will. “She was very loving and won people over with her beautiful smile.”

Starting with the 2019-20 school year, one special education student seeking post-high-school education, such as college or a trade school, will be eligible for a $25,000 scholarship thanks to Via Cava’s million-dollar gift. The district also plans to give a scholarship out the 2018-2019 school year, although it may not be the full $25,000 amount depending on the investment, said Triggiano.

The money will stay in a fund that will generate interest, allowing the district to continue giving out the scholarships for years to come, said Business Administrator Kevin Cartotto.

Via Cava, who had no children, had spent most her of professional career in the school district, teaching both regular and special education.

What are the odds!?:NJ state trooper pulls over retired cop who delivered him

D'awww:Woman helps kittens found in Dumont dumpster get homes

Her desire to pay it forward to help the future generation comes as no surprise to those who knew her best. Jablonski first met Via Cava over 35 years ago, when he operated an Annie Sez store in Closter. Via Cava would come in all the time with her husband, eventually becoming a regular customer. After her husband died around 1998, Via Cava, who lived in Oradell, would continue to frequent the store, making friends with whomever she came across that day.

“She was an amazing woman who could light up a room just by walking in,” Jablonski said. “She had a smile that was unbelievable. She could talk to anybody just to start conversation with them, and by the time they walked away, they would be hugging.”

It wasn’t just strangers that she had a knack for connecting with, but former students, too. No matter how many years had passed, she would still recognize and chat with them.

In some cases, she would help former students — who were then in their 20s or 30s — find jobs, thanks to the connections she had made in the area, said James Kennedy, another friend.

“She had an uncanny memory when it came to her students and could remember things that happened a long time ago,” he said.

Kennedy, who would eventually become principal at the district's Selzer School, knows firsthand how well Via Cava connected with students: He was one of her students himself. Kennedy had Via Cava for seventh-grade English when she taught regular education courses.

“She had a very good sense of humor,” Kennedy said. “She made kids feel relaxed and was very approachable as a person.”

Kennedy would eventually leave Dumont to go to college and teach in the Bronx, but later came back to his home district to work as a director of special services. There he reunited with Via Cava, who was then working as a learning consultant for the Child Study Team.

In addition to being a caring teacher in the classroom, Via Cava tried to help students outside the classroom, Kennedy said. She would befriend their parents and refer them to after-school groups that help special education students transition into daily life.

During all the time she was teaching and selflessly caring for students, Via Cava scrimped and saved, denying herself many things.

Jablonski thought it was probably a habit she picked up from having endured the Great Depression. When she started to lose her hearing later in life, she even refused to get hearing aids, Jablonski said.

“The Great Depression really left a mark on her,” he said. “I asked her what she was saving for, since she could afford it, and it would change her life for the better.”

What she was saving for, it turns out, was to help Dumont students, just as she had done throughout her life.

“She’s leaving behind a lasting legacy,” Jablonski said.",https://njersy.co/2JlFsl1
"Denver votes to remove taxes from tampons, pads","Denver votes to remove taxes from tampons, pads",1.0,"Feminine hygiene products are going to be a little cheaper in Denver starting in July after the city council voted Tuesday night to get rid of a 'tampon tax.'

The Denver City Council voted unanimously on Tuesday night to remove a local sales tax on feminine products sold within the city.

The 'tampon tax' bill will get rid of the city’s 4.3 percent tax on products like tampons and pads. Consumers will still be required to pay state taxes on feminine hygiene products.

The bill, which passed 11-0, defines feminine hygiene products as “products that are designed to absorb or contain menstrual flow. Feminine hygiene products include, but are not limited to, tampons, menstrual pads, and sanitary napkins, pantiliners, menstrual sponges, and menstrual cups.”

Supporters point out menstruation is not a choice. Tuesday's decision also reclassifies those feminine products as ""medically necessary.""

The bill will take effect on July 1, 2019.

Kenyan woman finds a way to recycle plastic waste into bricks that are stronger than concrete,Kenyan woman finds a way to recycle plastic waste into bricks that are stronger than concrete,1.0,"Using her ingenuity and engineering skills, Nzambi Matee found a way to help the environment by converting plastic waste into building materials.

In 2017, Matee opened a factory in Nairobi called Gjenge Makers, where workers take plastic waste, mix it with sand, and heat it up, with the resulting brick being five to seven times stronger than concrete. The factory accepts waste that other facilities ""cannot process anymore, they cannot recycle,"" Matee told Reuters. ""That is what we get.""

The bricks are made of plastic that was originally used for milk and shampoo bottles, cereal and sandwich bags, buckets, and ropes. Every day, Gjenge Makers produces about 1,500 bricks, in different sizes and colors. Matee is a materials engineer, and she designed the factory's machines after becoming sick of waiting for government officials to do something about plastic pollution. ""I was tired of being on the sidelines,"" she told Reuters.

Since opening, Gjenge Makers has recycled 20 tons of plastic waste, and Matee plans on adding a larger production line that will allow the factory to triple its output.

Zero elephants poached in a year in top Africa wildlife park,"One of Africa's largest wildlife preserves is marking a year without a single elephant found killed by poachers, which experts call an extraordinary development in an area larger than Switzerland where thousands of the animals have been slaughtered in recent years",1.0,"Zero elephants found killed by poachers in a year in one of Africa's largest wildlife reserves

JOHANNESBURG -- One of Africa's largest wildlife preserves is marking a year without a single elephant found killed by poachers, which experts call an extraordinary development in an area larger than Switzerland where thousands of the animals have been slaughtered in recent years.

The apparent turnaround in Niassa reserve in a remote region of northern Mozambique comes after the introduction of a rapid intervention police force and more assertive patrolling and response by air, according to the New York-based Wildlife Conservation Society, which manages the reserve with Mozambique's government and several other partners.

Monitoring of the vast reserve with aerial surveys and foot patrols remains incomplete and relies on sampling, however. And despite the sign of progress, it could take many years for Niassa's elephant population to rebuild to its former levels even if poaching is kept under control.

Aggressive poaching over the years had cut the number of Niassa's elephants from about 12,000 to little over 3,600 in 2016, according to an aerial survey. Anti-poaching strategies from 2015 to 2017 reduced the number killed but the conservation group called the rate still far too high.

The new interventions, with Mozambican President Felipe Nyusi personally authorizing the rapid intervention force, have led partners to hope that Niassa's elephants ""stand a genuine chance for recovery,"" the conservation group said.

""It is a remarkable achievement,"" James Bampton, country director with the Wildlife Conservation Society, told The Associated Press. He said he discovered the year free of poaching deaths while going through data.

The last time an elephant in the Niassa reserve was recorded killed by a poacher was May 17, 2018, he said.

Political will is a key reason for the success, Bampton said, with Mozambique's president keen to see poaching reduced.

Bampton acknowledged that the low number of remaining elephants is also a factor in the decline in poaching. A year ago, he estimated that fewer than 2,000 elephants remained in Niassa, though he now says preliminary analysis of data from a survey conducted in October and not yet published indicated that about 4,000 elephants are in the reserve.

Still, a year that appears to be free of elephant poaching in the sprawling reserve drew exclamations from some wildlife experts.

""It is a major and very important development that poaching has ceased. This represents a major success,"" George Wittemyer, who chairs the scientific board for the Kenya-based organization Save the Elephants, told the AP.

The new rapid intervention police force is an elite unit that is better-armed than the reserve's normal rangers and has ""a bit of a reputation of being quite hard,"" Bampton said, adding that no ""bad incidents"" have been reported in Niassa.

Members of the force are empowered to arrest suspected poachers, put together a case within 72 hours and submit it to the local prosecutor, Bampton said. ""Just being caught with a firearm is considered intent to illegal hunting,"" with a maximum prison sentence of 16 years.

Wildlife experts have seen gains elsewhere in Africa against elephant poaching. Tanzania's Selous Game Reserve, widely acknowledged as ""Ground Zero"" for poaching and linked to the Niassa reserve by a wildlife corridor, also has seen a recent decline in the killings.

African elephant poaching has declined to pre-2008 levels after reaching a peak in 2011, according to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.

But experts say the rate of annual elephant losses still exceeds the birth rate, and the encroachment of human settlements is reducing the animals' range. Africa's elephant population has plummeted from an estimated several million around 1900 to at least 415,000, according to surveys in recent years.

Collaboration and ""huge effort"" among the Niassa reserve's partners has been crucial but data show that issues remain with other iconic species such as lions, said Rob Harris, country manager for Fauna & Flora International, which supports one of the operators in the reserve. ""So the combination of national-level support and on-the-ground effort must be maintained to improve the situation for all wildlife.""

Michael Esmond's generosity started last year when he paid the utility bills of 36 households in his community of Gulf Breeze. This year, with both Hurricane Sally and Covid-induced economic turmoil hitting the city, he thought he needed to up the ante.

""This year to me probably is more meaningful that last year with the pandemic and all the people out of work having to stay home,"" Esmond told CNN. ""Hurricane Sally slammed us pretty good and hurt a lot of people. We still have a lot of the blue roofs here, where they're just covered with tarps.""

Esmond donated $7,615.40 to pay for the past-due bills of 114 households, according to Joanne Oliver, the city's utility billing supervisor. Holiday cards notifying the residents will be mailed this week, she says.

While Esmond's donation increased from the $4,600 he paid last year, he says he was able to help about three times as many households. That's because there were many residents who had bills due of $100 or less, so he was able to help more people.

""That really impacted me -- that people can't even afford to pay a $100 bill on their utilities and things are so bad,"" Esmond said. ""That's why I was able to pay for 114 families.""

Business was good in 2020 for 74-year-old Esmond, owner of Gulf Breeze Pools and Spas. It's something he says he's ""almost ashamed"" to tell people because he knows how hard it's been for many.

""We've had a good year, and that's why I want to share what I have with the people who need it,"" he said.

Beyond the coronavirus pandemic's economic toll, Gulf Breeze has dealt with the lingering effects of Hurricane Sally , which hit the panhandle hard.

A storm-related accident damaged a section of the newly built Pensacola Bay Bridge that connects to Gulf Breeze, authorities said in September.

A barge slammed into a portion of the structure, known to locals as the Three Mile Bridge, Brad Baker, Santa Rosa County's public safety director, said in a September Facebook video.

Given the pandemic's havoc on the city, Oliver, the city's utility billing supervisor, said residents are getting a longer grace period before their utilities for water, gas and sewer are disconnected.

""We're not cutting customers off. We're not disconnecting them for nonpayment until they are more than 60 days past due,"" Oliver said.

The check Esmond wrote covered the bills for people who were 60 days past due, she says. The balance after that covered those who were more than 30 days overdue and had a Covid-19 deferral, as they were directly affected by the virus.

""Even though our country and our city is currently going through probably the most difficult years of some of our lifetimes, there are still people out there who are generous and kind and really do want to help others,"" Oliver said. ""To have others within the community wanting to reach out and help their neighbors, now is more important than ever.""

Esmond's generosity comes from a place of understanding. In the 1980s, his utilities were shut off.

""I have been down on my luck like people are today, where I had trouble paying bills and raising three daughters,"" he said. ""The gas company shut the gas off and we didn't have any heat.""

It happened to be the coldest winter he's ever experienced in the area, and temperatures were in the single digits, he says.

""I can relate to people suffering and not being able to pay bills,"" Esmond said. ""That's probably one of the biggest motivators for me, because I've been there.""

The timing of Esmond's donation is no accident.

""People can't afford to pay their bills and put food on the table, so I hope doing my part and paying some bills for these folks takes a little bit of stress off of them around Christmas time,"" he said.",https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/10/us/florida-utility-bills-paid-trnd/index.html
"BangBros buys porn doxxing site, torches hard drives in the site's first SFW video","BangBros buys porn doxxing site, torches hard drives in the site's first SFW video",1.0,"Screenshot : YouTube

BangBros has emerged as the folk hero of the porn industry with its most recent acquisition: PornWikiLeaks. The adult-themed production company bought out the doxxing site, which housed over 15,000 porn stars’ personal information, according to Mashable. What did they do with all that information? Well, these producers of NSFW content made it clear with a very SFW video of them setting fire to the servers holding all that explicit info. That’s both figuratively and literally, because they actually took gasoline and a lighter and scorched that shit out of existence.



BangBros now owns the domain for the site, which exists solely now to host a statement from the company. “We simply didn’t want it out there for the world to see anymore,” they write about the personal info of the adult film performers. “While shutting this site down doesn’t purge the internet of all possible ties to real names and what not, it does make it one less place to harbor and find these things easily. A forum that had 300,000 posts on it, most of them negative and hate-filled, has now disappeared.”

According to Mashable, The Wayback Machine’s archive on the site has also been completely deleted, so the cached data can’t be so easily reached again.

Intensive care nurse finds out new colleague is baby she treated 28 years ago,Nurse finds out new colleague is baby she treated 28 years ago,1.0,"Young Vilma and an even younger Brandon (Picture: Brandon Seminatore/SWNS)

You never realise how the small world is until you find out that your new colleague is actually the baby you treated 28 years ago.

While most of us haven’t experienced that, that’s exactly what happened to intensive care nurse Vilma Wong.

The 54-year-old was shocked to learn that the new doctor on the block, Brandon Seminatore, was in fact a baby she nursed when he was born.

Vilma took care of Brandon when he was delivered prematurely at 26 weeks.

Vilma has been working in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital in Palo Alto, California for 32 years.

When she saw the young doctor’s name, she instantly recognised it but could not place where she’d seen it before.

When Brandon revealed that they both worked at the hospital he was born in, she knew who he was.

Brandon, who is specialising in child neurology, even had a picture of the two taken during his early days.

They were reunited 28 years later (Picture: SWNS)

‘I got very suspicious because I remember being the primary nurse to a baby with the same last name,’ Vilma explained about seeing his name for the first time.

‘I asked him if his dad was a police officer and there was a big silence and then he asked me if I was Vilma.

‘I said yes.

‘Apparently, his mother asked him to look for nurse Vilma in the NICU, but he told his mom that I had probably retired by now.

‘I was in shock initially but overjoyed to know that I took care of him almost 30 years ago and now he’s as a pediatric resident to the same population he was part of when he was born.’

Brandon said: ‘Meeting Vilma was a surreal experience.

‘I never expected to meet a provider who took care of me when I was a baby.

‘When Vilma recognised my name, I remembered the photos my parents had shown me and I truly sunk in that I was one of these babies.

‘I’ve come full circle and I’m taking care of babies with the nurse who took care of me.

‘Not all of us will get the chance to see our patients grow up, and I was so happy to be able to share that moment with her.’

Chance the Rapper surprises Montgomery County teacher with ‘Grammy for teachers’,So my cousin was just given a “Grammy for Teachers” award by Chance the Rapper for the lesson themed raps he made for his students. Our whole family is pretty excited about it.,1.0,"Chance the Rapper surprised a Hallie Wells Middle School teacher with a national award, including $30,000 in prize money, during a virtual awards ceremony Friday night. Image from live stream of awards presentation

Chance the Rapper, a popular Chicago musician, surprised a Hallie Wells Middle School teacher with a national award, including $30,000 in prize money, during a virtual awards ceremony Friday night.

Streaming live to his 11.7 million followers on Instagram, Chance gave the final of 10 awards to Michael Doggett, an English teacher at the Clarksburg school. The awards were presented over three days during National Teacher Appreciation Week.

Doggett talked with Chance the Rapper, whose songs include “No Problem” and “Hot Shower,” for about 15 minutes via webcam as thousands watched.

Sponsored by Box Tops for Education and General Mills, the inaugural Twilight Awards were presented to educators who show dedication, originality and creativity to engage students.

After recognizing a librarian from Lincoln, Nebraska, and a physical education teacher from St. Louis, Missouri, Chance summoned a drumroll and announced the final winner.

“The fact you’re in the field of teaching is a blessing to humanity, and it’s a big deal you’re hands on in developing the next generation,” Chance said to Doggett.

Obviously emotional, Doggett said he’s been engaged in teaching since his sister was born when he was 9 years old. Teaching, he said, makes him “feel like I have a mission and like I have a purpose.”

Doggett was nominated by his colleagues at Hallie Wells for his work to engage students by incorporating youth culture and hip-hop in his lessons. Doggett, who has worked at Hallie Wells for three years, organizes an annual hip-hop showcase at the school. He helps students write, produce and perform their own music, some of which is played in the hallways between classes, Chance said.

During remote learning due to the coronavirus pandemic, Doggett has posted videos of himself rapping.

The lyrics are generally words of encouragement for his students, which has helped keep them motivated, according to a message submitted to support Doggett’s nomination.

Chance praised Doggett for his “raw as hell” and “super dope” approach to teaching.

“I’m just trying to take in everything my students are giving me emotionally and be able to connect with them in any way that I can,” Doggett said during the live stream, “and this is the best way I can do it.”

In a message to Bethesda Beat on Saturday, Doggett said he doesn’t do his work alone.

“Although so many of them are true heroes, unfortunately, only very few teachers get to feel as appreciated as I have during this Teacher Appreciation Week,” Doggett wrote. “One of those heroes is my friend, Mr. Ritchie, whose selflessness and creativity inspired me to write Hey Students 8: Teachers’ Edition. In this unprecedented time in the history of education, we are all in this together for our kids.”

Chance said he began exploring the idea of hosting an awards ceremony equivalent to “the Grammys for teachers” in 2017, after donating $1 million to Chicago Public Schools for enrichment programming. After working with teachers in the city, Chance said he realized educators are “grossly and criminally underpaid, in overcrowded classrooms.”

“I started wondering, ‘Why do I have all these awards for my silly little singing, and I’m not raising the next generation?’ ” Chance said. “… We’re living in a crazy moment in American history and world history right now, and the people who are gonna fix the world are the ones raising the next generation.”

Doggett will receive $15,000 of the prize money from the award and Hallie Wells Middle School will receive $15,000.",https://bethesdamagazine.com/bethesda-beat/chance-the-rapper-surprises-montgomery-county-educator-with-grammy-for-teachers/?fbclid=IwAR21SuyohYUB9c9W-la3wZEI2Z1_CF7TK-gBQaOF_g2rjqlJmRv7e8od8jA
Ikea reveals mixed progress towards 'climate-positive' and circular economy goals,"The world's largest furniture retailer IKEA has revealed that 70% of the materials used to make its products during 2018 were either renewable or recycled, as it strives to reach the 100% mark by 2030.",1.0,"Ikea reveals mixed progress towards 'climate-positive' and circular economy goals

The world's largest furniture retailer has revealed that 70% of the materials used to make its products during 2018 were either renewable or recycled, as it strives to reach the 100% mark by 2030.

The progress was posted in Ikea’s latest sustainability report, which also documents the actions the retail giant has taken to date to achieve its visions of becoming “climate-positive”, free from single-use plastic and sourcing 100% renewable energy. These overarching aims were set last June as part of Ikea’s refreshed ‘People and Planet Positive’ sustainability strategy.

Published late last week, the sustainability report reveals that 60% of all the raw materials Ikea sourced to produce products during 2018 were from “renewable” sources such as cotton and bamboo, with a further 10% accounted for by pre or post-consumer recycled material. It claims that Ikea is “on track” to achieve 100% by 2030 but will need to work with industry to spur the creation of larger supply chains for recycled materials such as wood, plastic and fabrics.

The 59-page report additionally notes that 100% of the cotton sourced by Ikea during 2018 was certified as sustainable for a second year running, while the proportion stood at 85% for wood – up from 77% in 2017.

With regards to renewable power, the report reveals that Ikea now uses renewable generation to meet 86.7% of the heating and 81.1% of the electricity needs across its manufacturing supply chain. Key renewable arrays installed during 2018 include an 18,240-panel rooftop solar solution on Ikea’s Industry production unit in Portugal and an innovative solar cooling system at its Alexandra store in Singapore. The system converts thermal heat into chilled water for air conditioning in the store and has reduced the site’s energy consumption by almost one-quarter (24%) to date.

“We always think long term, innovating to ensure that our actions to meet people’s needs today do not compromise the ability of future generations to meet their needs,” the Inter Ikea Group’s head of sustainability Lena Pripp-Kovac wrote in the report foreword.

“This requires us to rethink and inspire changes in lifestyles and consumption and to transform our way of working – from linear to circular, from consuming to regenerating resources.”

Climate positive challenges

The progress update comes as Ikea is striving to become “climate-positive” by 2030 – an aim the firm has defined as fulfilling its contribution to the Paris Agreement through an emissions reduction across the value chain that is aligned to climate science.

The multinational is targeting an 80% climate footprint reduction from stores and operations in absolute terms by 2030 – against a 2016 baseline – which aligns to a 2C target and aims towards the 1.5C trajectory towards the end of the century. Ikea claims that reducing emissions by 15% from the value chain by 2030 translates to a 70% reduction in climate footprint on average per product, and is therefore working to decarbonise key materials, food ingredients and transport, while setting more ambitious reduction targets for direct suppliers.

According to the new sustainability report, the climate footprint of Ikea’s value chain during 2018 was 2.8% higher than in 2016, largely due to the expansion of the business. It lists the key contributors to the business’s overall climate footprint as raw materials (36.4%), product use at home (22.2%) and customer travel and home deliveries (15.5%).

“Decoupling our growth from greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will take time, and we expect our emissions to increase for a few years before decreasing,” the report states.

“Becoming climate positive will be a huge challenge for Ikea. We will only achieve it by joining together with others and listening to feedback from our stakeholders on how to improve.”

Living Lagom

The report also lists a number of other key sustainability challenges which lay between Ikea and the achievement of its sustainability goals, including the improvement of working conditions throughout its supply chains, the need to bolster value chain reporting and the urgency of inspiring new sustainable consumption models among the general public.

The latter of these challenges has long been addressed by Ikea’s “Live Lagom” campaign, which urges consumers to adopt its Swedish cultural vision of creating a home in which they create a harmonious lifestyle by not wasting resources or energy. The scheme has included the launch of dozens of innovative products designed to make home living more sustainable, including meatless meatballs, a kitchen made using 100% post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastics and PCR wood and energy-efficient lighting.

New products unveiled within this range last year include air-purifying curtains, a water-saving mister nozzle and vegetarian hotdogs, while Ikea is also in the process of transforming its offerings and store models to encourage more sustainable consumption and travel habits. The firm’s new Greenwich store, for example, includes an interactive upcycling hub and lab, a network of electric vehicle (EV) chargers and real-time displays of public transport information. It additionally offers customers the chance to have their items delivered by e-bike or electric van and to send their end-of-life products for recycling when they receive a delivery of new goods.

Turning Ambition into Action at edie Live 2019

In a similarly honest fashion to Ikea, a number of big businesses including Landsec, Sky and Waitrose will appear at edie Live (21-22 May 2019) to discuss the challenges and opportunities to achieving a sustainable future.

The two-day show – edie's biggest event of the year – has become a highlight of the calendar for sustainability, energy and environment professionals looking for new ideas and solutions that will help them achieve a low-carbon, resource efficient and profitable future for their business.

'FaceTime for Nana' is easing isolation for elders in SouthCoast nursing homes,Nurse tries to raise $300 for an iPad for a nursing home. Raises thousands and is now distributing iPads around Massachusetts nursing homes,1.0,"Sarah Firth was scanning through her newsfeed on Facebook earlier this week when something caught her attention.

It was an image of an adult daughter standing outside the window of her mother’s room at a nursing home, holding a white board as her only means of communication.

“It made me cry,’ said Firth, a nurse with New Bedford Public Schools. “I thought these poor people in the nursing homes; they’re so scared and isolated. I wish I could get a bunch of iPads to give to them.”

(Editor's note: This content is being provided for free as a public service to our readers during the coronavirus outbreak. Please support local journalism by subscribing to The Standard-Times.)

Once her husband, Peter, assured Firth that iPads would be able to connect those in nursing homes with their loved ones through FaceTime, Firth reached out to her friend, Jill Valadao, to see if she was interested in starting a fundraiser together.

Valadao, a speech therapist, jumped at the opportunity to help.

“I work with geriatrics and home care. I worked in a nursing home for years before this,” said the Dartmouth resident. “When this started, the focus was on how local kids were going to get fed with schools closed and that’s been taken care of.

“The people in nursing homes get forgotten. Out of sight is out of mind. I remember when I worked in a nursing home the patients with dementia, they’re used to seeing their families every day and it’s troubling if they don’t. Your heart breaks for those people.”

When Valadao created the Facebook fundraiser page “FaceTime for Nana” on St. Patrick’s Day, the goal was to raise $300, enough for one iPad. As of Friday afternoon, they had raised more than $3,000.

“We thought maybe we can get enough money for one iPad for one nursing home. When we started it, we had hoped for more, but you never know with fundraising,” said Firth, a Dartmouth resident. “It’s just kind of grown. It was a small act of kindness and it’s grown into something bigger. In a world now where everyone is fending for themselves, you have to keep doing stuff for others.”

Valadao was pleasantly surprised with the support from the community.

“It brings out the good in people,” she said. “Just to see the people who are donating, it takes your breath away. Some people are giving $300. It’s uniting people.”

The first three iPads were carefully delivered by Firth and Valadao Friday morning to Autumn Glen’s memory unit in Dartmouth and Alden Court Nursing Care and Royal of Fairhaven Nursing Center in Fairhaven.

“We each took our own car to be socially responsible,” Firth said. “The staff person from each site met us outside and we handed it over. We had gloves on and wiped down the packages right as we handed them over. We did a quick drop off. It was just really great.”

The response has been amazing.

Later that morning Firth got a message from Alden Court activity director Sharon Jensen thanking them on behalf of the residents and staff for the new iPad.

The message on Alden Court’s Facebook page read:

“During such a difficult time, these sweet gestures literally make the residents days. Yesterday more than 75 face time calls were made to families at Alden. This process has kept our families connected and reassured that their loved one is safe and content. The residents get a kick out of the technology and share a few laughs/smiles when they see their loved one on the ipad.

Our goal is to find positive things to keep the resident spirits up and this is one of the many good things happening. Today, the residents and the staff will be receiving performances from local young performers donating their time and their talents to present mini concerts for the residents VIA FACE TIME. The Ipad gift was a blessing today. So thank you Sarah for thinking of Alden Court.”

“They were so grateful,” Valadao said. “I feel like there’s some stigma with screen time, but now people are using it for good during these uncertain times. I like to see the positive in all of it. This technology is connecting people.”

Firth said she hopes this will provide some comfort to those who can’t be with their loved ones.

“I just want to say elderly people are vulnerable as it is, COVID-19 aside,” she said. “Especially those suffering from dementia and Alzheimers, they feel isolated already. We thought seeing a familiar face might make them feel connected.”

Work 50 minutes for meal at Tokyo eatery,"No money to pay for a meal? No problem - just work for 50 minutes. That is the recipe to combat hunger for Ms Sekai Kobayashi, 33, a former engineer who will not turn away penniless customers at her restaurant Mirai Shokudo (translated as Future Eatery) in Tokyo.",1.0,"TOKYO • No money to pay for a meal? No problem - just work for 50 minutes.

That is the recipe to combat hunger for Ms Sekai Kobayashi, 33, a former engineer who will not turn away penniless customers at her restaurant Mirai Shokudo (translated as Future Eatery) in Tokyo.

""Instead, we offer meals in return for 50 minutes of labour at the restaurant. I use this system because I want to connect with hungry people who otherwise couldn't eat at restaurants because they don't have money.""

There is no staff other than her at the eatery, which seats 12 at a counter.

Customers have the option of paying for food or earning a free meal by serving dishes, clearing tables and performing other tasks.

So far, more than 500 people, including university students, have opted to work for their meals to save money, among other reasons.

Those who contribute their labour can either dine for free or receive a free-meal coupon that can be deposited at the restaurant's entrance for anyone to use.

Related Story Work 50 minutes for a meal: Other quirky restaurants with a good cause

Ms Kobayashi opened the restaurant two years ago in the city's Jinbocho district, aiming for ""a place where everyone is welcome and everyone fits in"".

""Through various methods, I've also kept the business profitable,"" she said of her business, where the daily lunch special is priced at 900 yen (S$10.50).

""I dabbled in shop management as a university student. Each year at the university's annual festival, I ran a dimly lit cafe stocked with books,"" said Ms Kobayashi of her initial foray into the food and beverage (F&B) trade.

""The cafe won first prize in the festival popularity contest in all four years when I was a student. I even opened cafes at other school festivals,"" she added.

After turning 20, she worked at a bar in Shinjuku's Golden Gai - a district in Tokyo known for its cosy bars and pubs - and other places.

After graduating from university, however, she found a non-F&B job because a bar master told her that ""it's not so bad to experience the outside world"".

She worked as an engineer at IBM Japan, then moved to Cookpad, which runs a cooking recipe site.

The company had an in-office kitchen where everyone could prepare and eat meals.

""My colleagues really liked the lunches I made for them. This led me to strongly consider opening my own restaurant,"" she recalled.

She enrolled for vocational training at a leading restaurant chain and other places before opening Mirai Shokudo.

But her engineering roots have not gone to waste.

""To manage my restaurant, I adopted an open-source model - a system through which software design is made available for free to the public so that everyone can improve upon it.

""I posted the restaurant's business plan and finances on its website so I can collect input from the public on how to make improvements. This information is also available for those who want to open their own restaurants.

""Sharing something with others means supporting those with ambition. That underpins my approach to work,"" she said.

A 56-year-old former teacher has regularly helped at the restaurant since the end of July.

""It's an exciting job because I work with a new person every time. It's interesting to develop a good rapport and work with others,"" said the woman, who hopes to carve out a new career in the food industry.

Every victim of the London Bridge attack who made it to hospital has survived their injuries, the Standard can reveal today.

The astonishing achievement saw medics being praised for their skill in dealing with so many critically ill patients.

21 of the 48 who were admitted to five hospitals were initially classed as ""critical"" and the number of lives saved is being seen as a testament to the success of London’s major trauma centre network, which ensures the most seriously ill patients get immediate world-class care.

The fact trauma doctors in the capital see so many ""penetrating injuries"" due to the knife crime epidemic meant they were able to put previous learning into practice, the Standard was told.

Hospital doctors also praised the ""outstanding and brave"" emergency response from London Ambulance Service and the improved first-aid skills of police and public at the scene which helped keep victims alive.

King’s College Hospital in Denmark Hill and The Royal London in Whitechapel, which received the bulk of the casualties, said all their patients had survived. NHS England confirmed that apart from French national Xavier Thomas, 45, whose body was found in the Thames, all seven other fatalities were at the scene.

By midday yesterday 29 victims were in hospital, 10 in critical care. St Mary’s in Paddington, St Thomas’ in Lambeth and UCLH in Bloomsbury were others to receive casualties.

Duncan Bew, clinical director of the major trauma centre at King’s, operated throughout Saturday night and into Sunday and said: ""It was very challenging but what we have trained for.

""Getting there early to receive them [on admission to the emergency department] was the key, or it would have been different. The vital role of public and professional first responders in the chain of survival at the scene is a very significant factor, and they should be praised. No one died who got to hospital.

""We had 15. Some arrived in police cars or vans that ‘scooped and ran’ people from the scene. That decision saved lives. London Ambulance Service also did a fantastic job faced with significant personal risk.""

Sunday Express business editor Geoff Ho treated in intensive care after being stabbed in the neck as he confronted the attackers. He tweeted from his hospital bed yesterday urging people to vote.

Football fan Roy Larner is also out of intensive care after being treated for wounds all over his body as he fought off all three attackers with his fists after declaring: ""F**k you, I’m Millwall.""

Brett Freeman, who was stabbed four times and described as a ""warrior"", is now home in Dagenham, according to the friend who photographed him in hospital. But doctors warned that some patients face weeks in critical care.

Dr Tom Hurst, a consultant in major trauma at King’s, said there was often a ""long tail"" in the need for treatment. He was on the scene as a London’s Air Ambulance medic but not called into action, and was back on shift at King’s on Sunday after a few hours’ sleep.

He said: ""We made eight to 10 intensive care unit beds available, most of which were needed. The incident has this really long tail. There are a handful of patients, maybe four or five, who [will need intensive treatment for] more than a week, perhaps many weeks.""

Police investigating the attack today arrested a 29-year-old man in Newham on suspicion of terrorism offences. Four men remained in custody. It has emerged that a gym in Ilford raided by officers yesterday had been reported to police two years ago over fears jihadists were being trained there.

Terrorists Khuram Butt, 27, Rachid Redouane, 30 and Youssef Zaghba, 22, met outside Ummah Fitness Centre five days before the attack. Butt worked at the gym and Zaghba was known to exercise there.

Wilson Chowdhry, chairman of the local Pakistani Christian Organisation, told the Times a man who ran gym classes there had boasted to him about ""training jihadists"".

Robert Loeb, the president of Temple Bnai Israel, told Forward: ""Everyone knows everybody, I know several members of the mosque, and we felt for them. When a calamity like this happens, we have to stand together.

""We have probably 25 to 30 Jewish people in Victoria, and they probably have 100 Muslims. We got a lot of building for a small amount of Jews.""

One of the mosque's founders, Shahid Hashmi, said: ""Jewish community members walked into my home and gave me a key to the synagogue.""

The centre was built in 2000.

Donations and an online fundraising campaign have raised more than $900,000 (£717,000) for reconstruction.

The blaze was discovered at at about 2am on Saturday by a clerk at a convenience store, who called the fire department. It took around four hours to bring it under control and no injuries were reported.

'Love has no borders': Arizona man fulfills Christmas wish list for Mexican girl who sent it by balloon,Arizona man finds a little girl’s Christmas wish list attached to a balloon all the way from Mexico. Tracks her down and delivers her toys.,1.0,"It was a Christmas wish that crossed international borders. An Arizona man fulfilled the Christmas list of an 8-year-old girl in Mexico whose letter to Santa reached him by way of balloon.

Earlier this month, Randy Heiss was hiking in Patagonia, Arizona, when he saw the ragged remains of a balloon with a note attached.

One side of the note read: “Dayami.” On the other was a numbered list written in Spanish.

Heiss' wife translated the list and the pair identified its likely sender as a girl named Dayami. The note was intended for Santa and asked for art supplies, slime, a doll and a dollhouse, among other things. No contact information was left on the note.

“It really touched my heart to find it and I said, ‘Well, how in the heck am I going to be able to figure out how to make contact with this little girl and make her wishes come true?'” Heiss told NBC affiliate KVOA in Tucson.

Heiss believed the winds carried Dayami’s Christmas wish list about 20 miles away from Nogales, Mexico.

He shared the letter on his Facebook account. After a few days with no leads, he enlisted the help of Radio XENY, a station in Nogales. The station posted Heiss’ story to its Facebook page.

Within an hour, they were able to find Dayami, who lives in Nogales.

The radio station told NBC News on Monday that it helped to arrange for Heiss and his wife to meet Dayami and her family at its offices late last week.

Heiss and his wife delivered the toys to Dayami and her younger sister, Ximena, during the meeting. It brought him ""healing joy"" to see the children's happy faces, Heiss told the ""Today"" show.

“Love has no borders,"" he said. ""That wall melted away for the day.”

As it turns out, the experience was a gift for the couple, too.

“We lost our son nine years ago,” Heiss told KVOA. “So we don’t have grandchildren in our future and so really getting to share Christmas with kids was something that’s been missing in our lives.”",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna951581
Africa declared free of wild polio in 'milestone',Africa to be declared free of polio,1.0,"Africa declared free of wild polio in 'milestone' By Naomi Scherbel-Ball

BBC News Published 25 August 2020

image copyright AFP image caption Polio can only be prevented through immunisation

Africa has been declared free from wild polio by the independent body, the Africa Regional Certification Commission.

Polio usually affects children under five, sometimes leading to irreversible paralysis. Death can occur when breathing muscles are affected.

Twenty-five years ago thousands of children in Africa were paralysed by the virus.

The disease is now only found in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

There is no cure but the polio vaccine protects children for life.

Nigeria is the last African country to be declared free from wild polio, having accounted for more than half of all global cases less than a decade ago.

The vaccination campaign in Nigeria involved a huge effort to reach remote and dangerous places under threat from militant violence and some health workers were killed in the process.

What is polio and has it now been eradicated in Africa?

Polio is a virus which spreads from person to person, usually through contaminated water. It can lead to paralysis by attacking the nervous system.

Two out of three strains of wild polio virus have been eradicated worldwide. On Tuesday, Africa has been declared free of the last remaining strain of wild poliovirus.

More than 95% of Africa's population has now been immunised. This was one of the conditions that the Africa Regional Certification Commission set before declaring the continent free from wild polio.

Now only the vaccine-derived polio virus remains in Africa with 177 cases being identified this year.

This is a rare form of the virus that mutates from the oral polio vaccine and can then spread to under-immunised communities.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified a number of these cases in Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Central African Republic and Angola.

How did Africa eliminate wild polio?

image copyright Getty Images image caption A polio vaccine was developed in 1952

Without a cure a vaccine developed in 1952 by Dr Jonas Salk gave hope that children could be protected from the disease. In 1961, Albert Sabin pioneered the oral polio vaccine which has been used in most national immunisation programmes around the world.

In 1996 poliovirus paralysed more than 75,000 children across the continent - every country was affected.

That year Nelson Mandela launched the ""Kick Polio Out of Africa"" programme, mobilising millions of health workers who went village-to-village to hand-deliver vaccines.

It was backed by a coalition of groups including Rotary International which had spearheaded the polio vaccination drive from the 1980s.

Since 1996 billions of oral polio vaccines have been provided, averting an estimated 1.8 million cases of wild poliovirus.

What have the challenges been?

The last communities at risk of polio live in some of the most complicated places to deliver immunisation campaigns.

Nigeria is the last country in Africa to have reported a case of wild polio - in Borno state in Nigeria's remote north-east, and the epicentre of the Boko Haram insurrection, in 2016.

At the time it was a frustrating set-back as the country had made huge progress and had gone two years without any cases being identified.

Outside Nigeria, the last place to have seen a case of polio was in the Puntland region of Somalia in 2014.

Conflict with the Islamist militant group Boko Haram has made parts of Nigeria particularly difficult to reach, Borno state in particular.

More than two million people have been displaced by the fighting. Frontline workers, 95% of whom were women, managed to navigate areas of conflict like Lake Chad by boat and deliver vaccines to remote communities.

Widespread rumours and misinformation about the vaccine have also slowed down immunisation efforts.

In 2003, Kano and a number of other northern states suspended immunisations following reports by Muslim religious leaders that the vaccine was contaminated with an anti-fertility agent as part of an American plot to make Muslim women infertile. Laboratory tests by Nigerian scientists dismissed the accusations.

Vaccine campaigns resumed the following year, but the rumours persisted. In 2013 nine female polio vaccinators were killed in two shootings thought to be carried out by Boko Haram at health centres in Kano.

It has taken decades to achieve eradication and overcome suspicion around the vaccine.

How polio survivors made a difference

Winning the trust of communities has been key.

Misbahu Lawan Didi, president of the Nigerian Polio Survivors Association, says that the role of survivors has been crucial in persuading people to accept the campaign.

image caption Misbahu Lawan Didi has worked hard to persuade sceptical parents to allow their children to have the vaccine

""Many rejected the polio vaccine, but they see how much we struggle to reach them, sometimes crawling large distances, to speak to them. We ask them: 'Don't you think it is important for you to protect your child not to be like us?'""

From polio survivors, to traditional and religious leaders, school teachers, parents, volunteers and health workers, a huge coalition developed to defeat polio. Working together they travelled to remote communities to immunise children.

How serious is polio?

Polio, or poliomyelitis, mainly affects children aged under five.

Initial symptoms include fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting, stiffness of the neck and pains in the limbs. It also invades the nervous system and can cause total paralysis in a matter of hours.

One in 200 infections leads to irreversible paralysis. Among those paralysed, 5% to 10% of people die when their breathing muscles become immobilised.

Could wild polio return?

Polio can be easily imported into a country that is polio free and from there it can spread rapidly among under-immunised populations.

This happened in Angola, which despite decades of civil war, defeated polio in 2001.

The country remained free from polio for four years until 2005 when a number of cases were thought to have been brought in from outside the country.

The WHO says that it is important countries remain vigilant and avoid complacency until there is global eradication.

If they let down their defence by failing to vaccinate, then wild polio could once again begin to spread quickly.

For all types of polio to be eliminated, including vaccine-derived polio, vaccination efforts will need to continue alongside surveillance, to protect children from being paralysed by the disease in the future.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-53887947
"Sikhs prepare over 30,000 free meal packets for Americans in self-isolation","USA: Sikhs prepare over 30,000 free meal packets for Americans in self-isolation",1.0,"By Reena Bhardwaj

New York [USA], Mar 24 (ANI): The Sikh Center of New York prepared and packaged more than 30,000 home-cooked meals for Americans in coronavirus self-isolation.

The Sikh community was approached by New York's Mayor office for food packages that were handed out to several distributing federal agencies in the area. Monday morning onwards the agencies will further distribute and deliver free food to COVID-19 affected people in New York City, one of the worst affected cities in the US by coronavirus.

Strict food hygiene practices were observed while the food was prepared such as maintaining social distancing and using face masks and gloves.

Himat Singh, coordinator of American Gurudwara Prabhandak Committee (east coast) told ANI: ""The 'Sewa' or service provided by the Sikh volunteers is a vegetarian meal comprising of dry fruits, rice and lentils.""

""The meals were prepared on Sunday and was packaged and loaded for delivery. The distribution starts on Monday in the morning, by local authorities. Volunteers who prepared and packaged the meal had a medical check and have been approved by physicians and health authorities,"" Singh added.

The distributing agencies will provide the food packages to the elderly or people having trouble getting food at the supermarket, specially-abled, homeless and single parents who are looking after their kids and can't go out, he further added.



Food items that have been previously donated to the Gurudwara are being used for this initiative and even the Gurudwara funds are being used. United Sikhs, an NGO based across the United States, also made an appeal to people from all walks of life to donate generously.

99 per cent of the people using the meals are Americans, the only Indians are those coming from overseas or students who are isolating for 14 days.

Several Sikh volunteers from the East, West Coast and the Mid West of the United States are ready with an infrastructure to help agencies across the country. They are geared with free food, shelter at Gurudwara's and even delivering essentials and medicines for the homeless and needy.

""Once we heard people were having a problem with food when they go shopping, they can't find food in the shopping centre, then we started reaching out to people in our personal capacity in the Bay Area(San Francisco),"" Dr Pritpal Singh, coordinator of the American Gurudwara Prabhandak Committee (west coast) told ANI.

He also said that they have seen firsthand it was mostly the elderly who needed their service and it's mostly vulnerable people who are worried about the virus.

The Sikh volunteers applauded the efforts of the federal agencies who have been working round the clock to combat the crisis and also appealed to follow the advisories sent out by the city, state and federal agencies.

Jathedar Harpreet Singh, Sri Akal Takht Sahib and the spiritual leader of the Sikh community told ANI that he appeals to the Sikh community and there is a need to spring into action as the pandemic crisis deepened in the world in the past few weeks.

""We have requested gurudwaras across the country and the world to especially reach out to the stranded Indian students and provide them meals and shelter, which will give relief to many worried parents back in India,"" Jathedar Harpreet Singh said. (ANI)

Editor’s note: This article was originally published in Feb. 2019.

OTTAWA — The national statistics office says fewer children are living in poverty and it is connecting the drop to the Liberal government’s signature child benefit.

The Liberals introduced the income-tested Canada Child Benefit midway through 2016, replacing a previous system of tax credits and the Conservatives’ universal child care benefit.

New Statistics Canada figures show 278,000 fewer children living below the poverty line in 2017 — the first full year of the benefit — compared to 2015 when the Liberals took office.

Statistics Canada says an increase in the value of child benefits, coupled with gains in market income, put more money into the pockets of families in 2017.

"NFL dream within reach for Central Florida star Shaquem Griffin, who lost hand as a child","Shaquem Griffin was born with amniotic band syndrome affecting his left hand. At age four, his mother found him in the kitchen, attempting to use a butcher's knife to self-amputate his fingers due to the pain. He is currently breaking records at the NFL combine.",1.0,"Even to a mother, the scream from her 4-year-old was more urgent and scary than anything she had heard before.

Tangie Griffin jumped out of bed and went to the bedroom where her twin sons slept. Shaquill was there, but Shaquem wasn’t. She frantically searched the house and found him in the kitchen.



For the record: A previous version of this article spelled Shaquill Griffin’s first name as Shaquille.

He had climbed to the silverware drawer and was threatening to cut his fingers off with a knife he held in his right hand.

“All I could do was take the knife away,” Tangie said. “He kept screaming that his hand hurt. I picked him up and rocked him back to sleep. And then I called the doctor.”

The next day, Shaquem Griffin’s left hand was amputated.

Shaquem, 22, recalled that night on a recent afternoon on the campus of Central Florida. He had just finished a practice for the Knights’ Jan. 1 game against Auburn in the Peach Bowl.

He was proud yet not boastful of being chosen American Athletic Conference Defensive Player of the Year in 2016. He was a finalist this year for UCF (12-0), the only undefeated team in major college football.

“My mom took me to a room [the next day] and all I remember is them putting a mask on me,” Shaquem said of the time he lost his hand. “When I woke up, I had a bandage on my hand and all I wanted was to get out of there.”

During Tangie’s pregnancy, doctors discovered a tiny amniotic membrane had wrapped around Shaquem’s hand.

“It’s a thin tissue you can barely see,” Tangie said. “The doctor answered the questions and explained the options. It could be taken off with a needle, but even the slightest move could have punctured [either of the twins] and it was possible one wouldn’t survive. I was not going to take that chance.”

Shaquem was born with fingers that were extremely painful to touch or pressure. On the night he went after a knife, he had banged his hand against the side of the bunk beds he shared with his twin brother, part of a family of four boys.

I didn’t care, I was going to play football regardless Central Florida linebacker Shaquem Griffin

The day after the surgery, Shaquem was taken to day care. He and he and his teacher were given explicit instructions for him not to do anything outside or take part in any activities.

“I go to pick him up and I find him outside with a football in his hand and his bandage just dripping blood,” Tangie said.

Shaquem has displayed this kind of determination his entire life.

“I didn’t care, I was going to play football regardless,” he said. “It was tough until I had my fingers removed, but after that I knew I was going to play again. The pain was gone. … It didn’t hurt when the ball hit.”

Shaquem and Shaquill, older by 60 seconds, formed an even deeper bond. Tangie says Shaquem insists you say 60 seconds instead of a minute because a minute sounds longer.

They made a pact, it was both of them or neither.

“Before we got to high school, before we got the first offer, we made the decision we were going to stick together no matter what,” Shaquem said. “We talked about going to the same college. We talked about living in the same house when we got older and even dating twins together.”

Shaquill, a rookie cornerback with the Seattle Seahawks, started to get offers. First Mississippi and then Florida State. South Florida, close to their home in St. Petersburg, offered a scholarship, but only to Shaquill.

“We were a package deal,” Shaquill said. “It started when we were young. That was type of bond we had. When scholarships came in, we kept it the same way.”

Amid the recruiting process, they visited Central Florida, viewed it as a perfect fit and committed before then-coach George O’Leary made a home visit.

Things went well for Shaquill but Shaquem struggled. In his second year, he was a second-string linebacker when the team went to play Penn State in Ireland. That’s when he learned he was demoted.

“I thought in my head, why did I get moved back just before the game?” Shaquem said. “I did everything they asked me to. I had a good camp. I worked my way up the depth chart. Then I got moved back to third string and then the scout team after the game.”

Shaquem redshirted that season and Shaquill moved a year ahead of him.

“It was tough on him,” Shaquill said. “He thought about stopping playing or transferring. It was as tough for me as it was for him. It’s like everything we believed in wasn’t going to come through.”

As a sophomore, Shaquem played on special teams and was a backup safety. A switch in coaching from O’Leary to Scott Frost changed everything.

In his junior year, as a linebacker, he started every game and finished 12th in the nation in sacks. He had 92 tackles, 57 of them unassisted, while playing in the same unit as his brother.

In Shaquem’s initial game, he ended the first play by vomiting.

“I think it was the nerves,” Shaquem said. “My brother grabbed my hand and said, ‘You play football. Stay calm, have fun and play football.’ After that I calmed down.”

Shaquem had another trong this season this year, and also developed as a team leader.

“He’s got great leadership and he plays hard,” outside linebacker Pat Jasinski said. “He’s everything you would want from a player at his position.”

The team views him just like any other player, with no restrictions.

“It’s funny, you don’t think about it at all until you’re watching film and see him reach for a ball with an arm without a hand,” Jasinski said. “Some of the stuff he does out there is out of this world, just crazy.”

Few people think UCF’s game against Auburn will be Shaquem’s last at a high level. He has his eyes on the NFL, and the league is looking back.

“I think he’s got a chance [to be drafted], absolutely,” said one NFL scout, who declined to be identified because they were disclosing internal information. “I think he could go later in the draft.

“I’ve never seen anything like it. The kid’s got more heart and passion and toughness. He’s a darn good football player.”

Shaquill wants teams to target his brother on the field because he has only one hand.

Advertisement

“Any coach would try and exploit him,” he said. “It will give him more times to prove them wrong. He loves that. The one hand makes him better.”

The twins talk at least three times a day, but usually not about football. On game days, it’s before warmups, after warmups and while they are strapping on pads.

Shaquem is a good talker — and a huge Seahawks fan. His chance of playing with his brother are about 1 in 32. So, judging from Shaquem’s path to this point, a pretty good chance.

"California limits pet store sales of cats, dogs and rabbits to rescue or shelter animals only","California limits pet store sales of cats, dogs and rabbits to rescue or shelter animals only",1.0,"(CNN) California pet stores soon will be allowed to sell dogs, cats and rabbits only if they come from shelters or non-profit rescue organizations.

Under legislation going into effect on January 1, store operators also will have to be able to provide records of origin for the animals or face a $500 penalty per animal.



Under the law, individuals are still allowed to buy from private breeders, but stores are prohibited from doing so. The Pet Rescue and Adoption Act was introduced by assembly member Patrick O'Donnell and signed into law by California Governor Jerry Brown in October 2017 Under the law, individuals are still allowed to buy from private breeders, but stores are prohibited from doing so.

In a press release issued at the time, O'Donnell touted the law as an end to ""puppy mills"" and ""kitten factories."" California is the first state in the country to introduce such legislation.

O'Donnell called the law a ""big win for our four-legged friends"" and also for taxpayers, who he said spent more than $250 million a year to house and euthanize shelter animals.

Schwarzenegger: 'Shortsighted' for California to defund pandemic stockpile he built,"Arnold Schwarzenegger personally delivered a cargo of 50,000 masks to doctors on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic",1.0,"Former CA governor Arnold Schwarzenegger delivers a cargo of 50,000 N-95 masks in Los Angeles | Daniel Ketchell Schwarzenegger: 'Shortsighted' for California to defund pandemic stockpile he built

OAKLAND — Former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger told POLITICO on Tuesday it was ""shortsighted"" for California leaders to abandon a $200 million emergency preparedness effort he initiated in 2006 to deal with a future pandemic, as the state now scrambles to prepare for a surge in coronavirus cases.

When the state budget swelled 14 years ago, Schwarzenegger launched a surge capacity stockpile that included mobile hospitals and medical gear intended to prepare California for a situation like it is facing today. With the state facing a $26 billion deficit in 2011, Gov. Jerry Brown and state lawmakers withdrew funding to maintain the supplies, according to an investigative report last week by Reveal and the Los Angeles Times.

As public servants, “our ultimate responsibility is not just to make a budget balance, but to save lives,’’ Schwarzenegger responded for the first time Tuesday in a phone interview. He said that when the bird flu emerged in 2006, he was deeply concerned about having sufficient supplies in California to handle potential disasters like infectious disease outbreaks and major earthquakes that could kill hundreds of thousands.

""I thought we have to be prepared — because we are the fifth largest economy in the world,'' he said.

The former governor on Tuesday never specifically mentioned or criticized Brown, his successor.

""Yes, there was a budget crunch ... it’s easy for them to just look at the numbers, but not really to visualize disaster,"" Schwarzenegger said of the 2011 cuts, which eviscerated the emergency medical program. ""They obviously made their judgments to take those expenditures out ... and to worry about a few million dollars.”

""Would I have done it? No,"" Schwarzenegger said. ""But I understand that every governor and every administration looks at those things differently.""

Schwarzenegger spoke to POLITICO after a trip to Los Angeles hospitals Tuesday, where he personally delivered a cargo of 50,000 masks to doctors on the front lines of the pandemic — a move to underscore his support of the Frontline Responders Fund. The former governor has donated $1 million to the GoFundMe effort to raise money for desperately needed equipment during the Covid-19 crisis. The cause, which has raised $5 million to date, has also been backed by Twitter’s Jack Dorsey, angel investor Ron Conway and Hollywood luminaries like Edward Norton.

The equipment was procured by the Bay Area-based logistics firm Flexport, which last week delivered 60,000 surgical masks, 34,000 gloves, 2,000 surgical gowns and 50 thermometers to San Francisco’s Department of Public Health, TechCrunch reported.

Schwarzenegger, asked about President Donald Trump’s performance during the pandemic, declined to criticize him, saying the first goal is to to tackle the pandemic. But he allowed that “the federal government has not been as quick in their response as they could have been.""

""The thing is, did you learn from your mistakes?"" he said. ""And did you admit your weaknesses? ... Because the way you improve is by just acknowledging, 'OK, you know, this is a screw-up, or I made a mistake there.' And [to say], 'This would never happen again.'""

Schwarzenegger said he has also been in regular touch with California Gov. Gavin Newsom, whom he gave high marks for the pandemic response — especially, he said, Newsom's early order to shelter in place, which may have saved lives.

“I think that he did a terrific job to be on top of it — and to stay on top of it,’’ he said. “Whatever he needs me to do, I’ll do ... I want to support him.""

But Schwarzenegger, who has been posting daily messages on Twitter about staying healthy and engaged during the pandemic, warned that now it’s critical that Californians must act on their own, volunteer or give to causes that will help give doctors what they need at this critical time.

California residents must recognize that ""government can only do so much,"" he said. ""At the end of the day ... it goes back to people power. And 'we the people' have the power to do our share — and just stay home.""",https://www.politico.com/states/california/story/2020/03/31/schwarzenegger-shortsighted-for-california-to-defund-pandemic-stockpile-he-built-1269954

She was playing Among Us together with Jagmeet Singh, leader of the NDP in Canada, and HasanAbi, a popular Twitch streamer and political commentator.

They were joined by other streamers, including Disguised Toast, Myth, Jacksepticeye, and many others. Even Félix ""xQc"" Lengyel, a controversial Twitch star who not long returned to the platform after a ban, was in the Among Us lobby for a couple of games.

Like with her previous stream, which had a goal to motivate the youth to vote, the last night's stream wasn't without a cause as well.

AOC used her stream to fundraise money for local food banks, legal aid, and community support organizations.

""This week, as some families celebrate Thanksgiving, others face food & housing insecurity at levels not seen since the Great Depression,"" says AOC on her fundraising page. ""Your contribution will directly bolster these critical efforts, at a moment they're needed the most.""

She even jokingly teased the idea of getting Bernie Sanders on with Hasan ""soon"", saying that he would love to play Among Us, but it might be too much technology for him, and so she recommended parlour game Backgammon instead.

The study evaluated all new voter registrations in the 39 states with available data since February 14, 2018—the day of the Parkland shooting—and calculated the change in the share of new registrants who are 18 to 29 years old. Across the country, the share of youth registrants increased by a modest 2.16 percentage points. But in Indiana, Virginia, and New York—home to some of this year’s marquee House and Senate contests—the share of youth registrants increased by 9.87, 10.49, and 10.7 percentage points, respectively. In Pennsylvania—where voters will decide as many as nine competitive congressional races—the share of new registrants who are younger than 30 jumped by a whopping 16.14 percentage points. The study doesn’t evaluate how many of the new registrants may have been motivated by the #NeverAgain movement.

The findings offer an early, measurable indication that youth turnout could be higher than in previous midterm elections, though there’s no guarantee that many of the new registrants will actually vote. Just under half of all 18-to-29-year-olds were registered to vote in 2014, but less than 20 percent of that population group ended up casting ballots that year. It was the lowest rate of of youth registration and turnout recorded in four decades, according to the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University.",https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/07/young-people-are-registering-to-vote-in-huge-numbers-new-study-finds/

An 'EpiPen' for spinal cord injuries,"Researchers have created an ""EpiPen"" for spinal cord injuries that can potentially prevent paralysis. Injecting specially designed nanoparticles immediately after the injury can stop the body's immune system from forming a scar that blocks the regeneration of the spinal cord’s nerve cells.",1.0,"ANN ARBOR—An injection of nanoparticles can prevent the body’s immune system from overreacting to trauma, potentially preventing some spinal cord injuries from resulting in paralysis.

The approach was demonstrated in mice at the University of Michigan, with the nanoparticles enhancing healing by reprogramming the aggressive immune cells—call it an “EpiPen” for trauma to the central nervous system, which includes the brain and spinal cord.

“In this work, we demonstrate that instead of overcoming an immune response, we can co-opt the immune response to work for us to promote the therapeutic response,” said Lonnie Shea, the Steven A. Goldstein Collegiate Professor of Biomedical Engineering.

Trauma of any kind kicks the body’s immune response into gear. In a normal injury, immune cells infiltrate the damaged area and clear debris to initiate the regenerative process.

The central nervous system, however, is usually walled off from the rough-and-tumble of immune activity by the blood-brain barrier. A spinal cord injury breaks that barrier, letting in overzealous immune cells that create too much inflammation for the delicate neural tissues. That leads to the rapid death of neurons, damage to the insulating sheaths around nerve fibers that allow them to send signals, and the formation of a scar that blocks the regeneration of the spinal cord’s nerve cells.

All of this contributes to the loss of function below the level of the injury. That spectrum includes everything from paralysis to a loss of sensation for many of the 12,000 new spinal injury patients each year in the United States.

Previous attempts to offset complications from this immune response included injecting steroids like methylprednisolone. That practice has largely been discarded since it comes with side effects that include sepsis, gastrointestinal bleeding and blood clots. The risks outweigh the benefits.

But now, U-M researchers have designed nanoparticles that intercept immune cells on their way to the spinal cord, redirecting them away from the injury. Those that reach the spinal cord have been altered to be more pro-regenerative.

Hopefully, this technology could lead to new therapeutic strategies not only for patients with spinal cord injury but for those with various inflammatory diseases.

Jonghyuck Park

With no drugs attached, the nanoparticles reprogram the immune cells with their physical characteristics: a size similar to cell debris and a negative charge that facilitates binding to immune cells. In theory, their nonpharmaceutical nature avoids unwanted side effects.

With fewer immune cells at the trauma location, there is less inflammation and tissue deterioration. Second, immune cells that do make it to the injury are less inflammatory and more suited to supporting tissues that are trying to grow back together.

“Hopefully, this technology could lead to new therapeutic strategies not only for patients with spinal cord injury but for those with various inflammatory diseases,” said Jonghyuck Park, a U-M research fellow working with Shea.

Previous research has shown success for nanoparticles mitigating trauma caused by the West Nile virus and multiple sclerosis, for example.

“The immune system underlies autoimmune disease, cancer, trauma, regeneration—nearly every major disease,” Shea said. “Tools that can target immune cells and reprogram them to a desired response have numerous opportunities for treating or managing disease.”

The research, published in the current issue of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, was supported by The National Institutes of Health. Shea is also the William and Valerie Hall Chair of Biomedical Engineering and a professor of chemical engineering.

Nestle creates wrapper that degrades in the sea within six months,Nestle creates wrapper that degrades in the sea within six months,1.0,"Nestle has launched a new recyclable wrapper for a snack bar that it claims will degrade in a marine environment within six months.

The YES! range will also be used on a high-speed packaging line in a ""world-first"" technological breakthrough.

Last year, the brand pledged to make all of its packaging recyclable or reusable by 2025.

Speaking about the wrapper, Michael Carroll, lead on innovation and sustainability for Nestle, said:

""We know it will degrade in a marine environment within six months, which, compared to the flow wrap that it's currently in, it's about 450 years.""

The confectionery company said it had to overcome 90 challenges to develop the material and adapt current machinery and processes to handle the product more gently.

Experts at its research and development centre in York said the 300 bars-per-minute ""flow wrap cold seal"" packing process, has previously only been suitable for use with more durable plastic films and laminates.

But it took the team just 10 months to come up with the design and adapt production lines to ensure the bars are kept in perfect condition during packaging, transport and storage.

Bruce Funnell, head of packaging at Nestle, said: ""This has been a real first for us.

""Really this is the first confectionery product bar that's wrapped at high speed and is ensuring we have a good shelf life without compromise to the consumer.""

Mr Funnell added that the wrappers contained around 60% recyclable fibres.

The new wrapper will rolled out on the YES! fruit and nut-based bars from July and will carry the message ""carefully wrapped in paper"".

Emotional classic car auction stuns family of young Red Deer couple killed in motorcycle crash,"Car is auctioned to pay for the care of two orphans. Car sells three times, car is donated back three times, totally $80,000 raised.",1.0,"Send this page to someone via email

An incredibly moving moment happened at a Red Deer auction this weekend. About $100,000 was raised for two young Red Deer children whose parents died in a motorcycle crash four months ago.

Brent and Nicole Keryluke were killed on May 5 after the motorcycle they were driving collided with a truck near Innisfail. They were 35 and 34 years old.

Their two young children, three-year-old Liam and six-year-old Arielle, are being cared for by grandparents with help from other members of the family.

“They get up in the morning and both of them are smiling and laughing,” Brent’s father Ben told Global News on Monday. Tweet This Click to share quote on Twitter: ""They get up in the morning and both of them are smiling and laughing,"" Brent's father Ben told Global News on Monday.

On the weekend, Ben and his wife Marilyn took a 1973 Pontiac Parisienne their son had been working on to Electric Garage Auctions to sell. The family didn’t want to part with the vehicle but as Ben explained, didn’t really have a choice. Both Liam and Arielle have hearing impairments, which means some additional medical costs now and in the future.

The family has been overwhelmed by the outpouring of support. Friends, family, even strangers have donated money through a GoFundMe page for the kids’ futures and then, what happened at EG Auctions on Saturday afternoon, floored them.

“They basically stopped the auction, let everybody know what was happening, where the money was going to go, and then we were shocked what happened after that,” Ben Keryluke told Global News on Monday.

What The World's Most Famous Amateur Can Teach Pro Runners,"Yuki Kawauchi just became the first amateur runner to win the boston marathon in decades. a high School Administrator, He's Known As the ""Citizen Runner"" in Japan, and he has to go back to work tomorrow.",1.0,"Photo credit: Alexander Hassenstein/ Getty

At just 30 years old, Yuki Kawauchi is in a distance running category of his own. As of January 1, he has run the most sub-2:20 marathons of anyone, ever—76. He’s also run the most sub-2:12 marathons of anyone, ever—25. Kawauchi—one guy—has run more sub-2:10 marathons since 2011 than the whole United States put together. Kawauchi’s best time for 2017—2:09:18—was two seconds faster than the fastest marathon of the year by any U.S. man, which would be Galen Rupp, who ran a career best of 2:09:20 in Chicago. Rupp, like most athletes at that level, ran two marathons in 2017. Kawauchi ran 12.



Advertisement

His singularity continues. Distance running at the top levels is dominated by East Africans; he’s Japanese. Most elite marathoners train with a group and a coach, with corporate sponsorship that allows them to train full-time. They run twice a day, spend time at altitude, and have access to the latest equipment, nutrition, and sport science. Kawauchi has neither coach nor training group nor corporate sponsorship. He fits once-a-day workouts around his full-time government job. He made his own home gym, and is more likely to look at the methods of great runners of the past than the training philosophy du jour. He’s wildly popular in Japan, and is one of the few distance runners anywhere with a truly global fan base.

Critics point to his relatively poor performances in big races—World Championships and World Marathon Majors—and the fact that his personal best of 2:08:14 is more than five minutes off the world record, not even close to the top 200 performances all-time.



But, the fact that this one guy has run consistently faster times than all U.S. marathoners combined, without all their resources, and seems to be having a grand time doing it, makes him worth listening to.



In March 2017, Ayano Onodera, an editor with Japanese media company SportsNavi, published Kawauchi’s extensive views on training and racing, and the future of Japanese running. The three-part essay was translated by editor of the English language blog Japan Running News, Brett Larner. Though it was not meant to be didactic, U.S. distance runners might at least be inspired to think differently about their pursuit. As Kawauchi said, “That’s why I want to show all the athletes at the powerful running schools [in Japan] who, like me in those days, are frustrated and injured, ‘There’s another world out there. Another way.’ By doing that I hope to give them the chance to feel again the love of the run.”

With that in mind, here are the most actionable takeaways from Kawauchi’s interview.



1. Incorporating jogging. Most top American runners would never on God’s earth use the term “jogging” to describe any part of their training, but Kawauchi loves it:



There are those who look at that kind of ultra long-distance jogging and say, “Running slowly is meaningless no matter how much you do,” but I think the people who make that kind of criticism have probably never done it themselves. If you actually experience the feeling you get after about three hours, the “I can endure this fatigue in my legs, but if I lose it mentally I’ll immediately want to quit” one that’s similar to the light-headed sensation at the end of the marathon, the numbness of hands and feet and loss of concentration that come after that, the feeling that your stamina is evaporating from the core of your body, and the overpowering sense of euphoria you get after going over the wall, I don’t think you can call it “meaningless.” The confidence that is built by doing ultra long-distance jogging, the knowledge in the second half when things are getting tough that I’ve run 50 km and 100 km so I know for sure that my stamina isn’t going to break in the second half. The internationals running next to me haven’t done 100 km so I know that my legs are the ones that are still going to keep moving when things get down and dirty, has really helped a person like me who tends to get discouraged easily.

2. Once-a-day training. Kawauchi trains once a day, mostly out of necessity since he works a full-time job. Most pro runners, on all continents, run twice a day, racking up mega miles which increase chances of injury.



For someone who only trains once a day like I have ever since I was at Gakushuin University, I feel that adding ultra long-distance jogging trail runs on my days off has been effective in improving my physical and mental ability to hold it together in the second half of the marathon. However, since the runners on many teams are obligated to do group morning runs in addition to their regular training sessions, in terms of both the time and physical demands, I think it would be hard for them to add the same kind of ultra long-distance jogging that I have. By doing morning runs every day they usually exceed 1000 km a month, but in my case I’m typically averaging about 600 km a month. When you consider that runners belonging to teams are doing 12 km a day on average in their morning runs, my monthly mileage is going to be at least 360 km less since I don’t do them. That means a physical margin of over 4320 km a year compared to other athletes, and I think that’s why ultra long-distance jogging has had such a major impact on me.



Conversely, if someone who is already doing over 1000 km a month kept doing their morning runs and tried to add ultra long-distance jogging to that, I think they would destroy their legs with stress fractures and whatnot. Old-school marathoners might get mad and say it’s a “soft way of thinking,” but I’m pretty sure the human body has a mileage limit. Working within that limit I think all you can do is choose between doing multiple short runs or longer single runs.

3. Being globally competitive. U.S. and Japanese distance runners are both struggling to be competitive in a sport dominated by East Africans. The goals and thought processes of runners in both countries are quite similar. Kawauchi offers the idea that marathoners can be competitive without running a 2:03 marathon.



The number of them [Japanese runners] who say, “My goal is to win a medal at the Olympics,” is very large, the number who say, “My goal is to set a world record,” is vanishingly small, and I’ve pretty much never met anyone who says, “My goal is to compete in international marathons all around the world.”

...the sole reason most frequently cited for why Japanese athletes can’t compete with “the world” is concept #2. In other words, the point of view that “Even though the world is running 2:02 and 2:03, Japan still can’t even break the 2:06 national record.” I have to wonder whether the people who voice that opinion are aware that only one person has ever run 2:02, once, and that in terms of sub-2:04, even including the record-ineligible Boston, you are talking about ten people on just five courses, Berlin, Chicago, London, Frankfurt and Boston.



There’s nothing better than being fast for being competitive, but there’s an element of being competitive that you can’t learn just from being fast. For example, Abel Kirui [Kenya, gold medalist in 2009 Berlin and 2011 Daegu World Championships] has a 2:05 PB, but that’s not something he has done multiple times. Even though he has run a lot of marathons, his second-best time is over 30 seconds slower than the Japanese national record. Both Uganda’s Stephen Kiprotich [2012 London Olympics and 2013 Moscow World Championships gold medalist] and Eritrea’s Ghirmay Ghebreslassie [2015 Beijing World Championships gold medalist] also have PBs slower than the Japanese national record. Following that line of thinking, I think it‘s impossible to say that Japan’s inability for many years to win medals at “The Olympics and World Championships” is exclusively due to a “time gap.”

4. Medaling or getting on the podium is not about running world-record pace for 26.2 miles, but running world-record pace for two or three miles late in the race. Championship style races, i.e. those without pacemakers in which runners are competing for a place rather than a time, are often won in 2:08 or 2:09 though the field is loaded with 2:04 speedsters. The podium spots are taken by runners who best weathered a couple fast miles between 20 and 22, and slowed the least after that. While he admits he hasn’t mastered it, Kawauchi says the key to medaling is late race surges.

... I’ve always thought that in order to win medals the element that Japanese people must foster is the more intangible (although evident if you look at mid-race split times) ability to handle small pace changes mid-race and surge battles late in the race.... In the last few years a considerable number of Japanese athletes have run times of 2:07 or 2:08. However, the only one who has been able to respond to a surge after 30 km and run a 5 km split of 14:39 at that point in the race was [Kazuhiro] Maeda.



At the Rio Olympics the American Galen Rupp won the bronze medal, and since he was also a speed runner with track achievements including a silver in the London Olympics 10,000 m there are now more people saying, “That just goes to show that Japanese people also need 26 minute-level speed in order to be competitive in the marathon.” However, the reality is that although Rupp ran 14:26 from 25 to 30 km, for the next 5 km after that he slowed down to 15:31, losing a lot of ground to eventual winner Eliud Kipchoge [Kenya]. In other words, if you could cover the 5 km after 30 km in 14:39 like Maeda, then at 35 km you would only be 13 seconds behind Rupp in the Rio Olympics. If you could then run within 15:18 [instead of the 15:31 Rupp ran] for the next 5 km after 35 km, you’d be in the race for a medal.

5. Running marathons is okay for young guns, if they approach it with a veteran’s sense of humility and patience. The conventional wisdom is that speed has an expiration date, so young, talented distance runners are counseled to stick with the short stuff, 5K and 10K. It’s thought marathon training will kill your speed so most top runners are around 30 years old when they run their first marathon. Kawauchi thinks it’s fine to apply the strength and speed of youth to the marathon, but cautions to check the youthful ego and impatience. You don’t want to “die and taste the torments of hell, to suffer injury and trauma that will destroy your self-confidence.”

I think it’s a good trend that young athletes are gaining awareness of the marathon while they have physical strength and speed. In my own experience, I learned many things from the two marathons I ran while attending Gakushuin University. If you don’t actually run the marathon there’s a lot you can’t understand just by armchair theorizing. But as the number of young athletes taking on the marathon increases in this way [in the buildup to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics], there are two things to be concerned about.



The first is that too many athletes have goals that are too high for their first marathons. If the goal is ultimately to run 2:05 or 2:06, I think that instead of saying, “Let’s rock the marathon right from the first time,” and jumping in only to die and taste the torments of hell, to suffer injury and trauma that will destroy your self-confidence, saying “Who cares what time you run in your debut? I want to be able to achieve my goal in the end,” and holding back to run at a pace that suits you will let you finish thinking, “Marathons are fun!” and let you run later marathons in a positive state of mind.",https://deadspin.com/yuki-kawauchi-can-teach-you-how-to-run-1821725233
"A 10-year-old girl has sent more than 1,500 art kits to kids in foster care and homeless shelters during the coronavirus pandemic","A 10-year-old girl has sent more than 1,500 art kits to kids in foster care and homeless shelters during the coronavirus pandemic",1.0,"(CNN) A young girl with a big heart has found just the way to cheer up other kids stuck at home during the pandemic.

Chelsea Phaire, a 10-year-old from Danbury, Connecticut, has sent more than 1,500 children in homeless shelters and foster care homes art kits to give them something uplifting to do when they're feeling down.

The kits -- which include markers, crayons, paper, coloring books, colored pencils, and gel pens -- are sent to schools and shelters across the country as part of Chelsea's Charity , an organization founded by Chelsea and her parents.

""Since she was seven, she was begging me and her dad to start a charity,"" Candace Phaire, Chelsea's mom, told CNN.

""She was so persistent, every couple of months she would ask, 'Are we starting Chelsea's Charity yet?' When she was turning 10, she asked us again, and we decided it was time to go for it.""

The rising 6th grader launched Chelsea's Charity on her birthday in August 2019, when she asked party guests to donate art supplies instead of getting her birthday gifts.

Chelsea getting ready

After her birthday party, Chelsea used the donations to send out her first 40 art kits to a homeless shelter in New York. The family then set up an Amazon wishlist full of art supplies. Every time they get enough donations, they pack up the kits and deliver them to kids in person.

In just the first five months, Chelsea and her mom sent out nearly 1,000 kits to children in homeless shelters, foster care homes, women's shelters, and schools impacted by gun violence.

Before the pandemic, Chelsea was able to travel with her mom across the country to meet the kids in-person, and even teaches them some of her favorite drawing tips.

Now, schools are closed, and social distancing precautions will not allow Chelsea to physically interact with the kids as much. Instead, she and her mom are mailing the kits.

Since March, when schools began to close, the family has sent over 1,500 kits to schools, shelters, and foster homes in 12 states across the US.

""I feel good inside knowing how happy they are when they get their art kits,"" Chelsea told CNN. ""I have definitely grown as a person because of this. Now my dream is to meet every kid in the entire world and give them art. Who knows, maybe if we do that and then our kids do that, we'll have world peace!""

Helping traumatized children through art

When Chelsea was 8, she lost someone very close to her heart. Her swim instructor, who she said she considered family, was killed from gun violence in the middle of their swim season.

That was the moment art went from being Chelsea's hobby to her therapy.

Knowing that other children have also gone through trauma inspired Chelsea to help make art more accessible to help others cope with their feelings.

""Art therapy is being prescribed a lot more to support the mental health of young kids, especially those with social and emotional deficiencies,"" Phaire, who is an early childhood education professor and former teacher, told CNN.

""Now with Covid-19, a lot of kids in shelters and also children in foster homes might not have access to art supplies they usually find in school. It's also mental health awareness month, so that's definitely motivating us to ramp it up send even more kits.""

With this year's added stress of a global pandemic and nationwide shutdown, it's more important than ever to make sure kids have ways to cope with the emotions that come with adjusting to today's new reality.

For kids in already stressful situations such as homelessness, this can be even more difficult.

One of the organizations that received art kits from Chelsea is James Storehouse , a non-profit that serves children in foster care ""from cribs to college.""

""When a child or youth enters foster care, they usually have no belongings of their own,"" Stacy DeWitt, James Storehouse executive director, told CNN. ""It's been a great addition to be able to offer the art kits, so the children and youth have a creative outlet to process their emotions during this traumatic time in their lives.""

She said the kits have also ""been fantastic for foster parents who have children at home during the stay-at-home orders.""

""It gives the children and teens a fun creative outlet to channel their energy because they can't be in the classroom right now. Chelsea's kits have been a blessing to many children in hard places and have brought them joy.""

While it may take her a little bit longer to reach every kid in the world, thanks to Chelsea's kindness, thousands of kids all over the country have at least one reason to smile.",https://edition.cnn.com/2020/05/20/us/10-year-old-girl-art-kits-foster-care-homeless-shelter-trnd/index.html
"Italian fashion house Gucci to go fur-free in 2018, says CEO",Gucci is going fur-free in 2018 and will auction its remaining animal fur items to benefit animal rights organizations,1.0,"Gucci will go fur-free next year and auction off all its remaining animal fur items, the Italian fashion house’s president and CEO Marco Bizzarri has announced.

The changes will come into force with the brand’s spring-summer 2018 collection, Bizzarri said during a talk at the London College of Fashion.

Gucci’s president said on Wednesday the move demonstrated “our absolute commitment to making sustainability an intrinsic part of our business”.

Bizzarri said the new approach was made possible thanks to Gucci’s creative director, Alessandro Michele, who was appointed in 2015.

“In selecting a new creative director I wanted to find someone who shared a belief in the importance of the same values,” Bizzarri said. “I sensed that immediately on meeting Alessandro for the first time.”

As part of the change a charity auction of the fashion house’s remaining animal fur items will be held, with the proceeds going to the animal rights organisations Humane Society International and LAV.

Kitty Block, president of Humane Society International, celebrated the luxury brand’s move as a “compassionate decision”.

“Gucci going fur-free is a huge game-changer,” she said in a statement. “For this Italian powerhouse to end the use of fur because of the cruelty involved will have a huge ripple effect throughout the world of fashion.”

Gucci will become part of the Fur Free Alliance, an international group of more than 40 organisations which campaigns on animal welfare and promotes alternatives to fur in the fashion industry.

People Are Buying Stamps And Praising Mail Carriers After The US Postal Service Said It Needs A Coronavirus Bailout,People Are Buying Stamps And Praising Mail Carriers After The US Postal Service Said It Needs A Coronavirus Bailout,1.0,"A US Postal Service worker wears a mask and gloves while delivering mail as the coronavirus pandemic continues in California, April 9.

But so far, the USPS hasn't received cash in the stimulus plans aimed at propping up other types of US businesses — prompting some people on Sunday to show support by buying stamps, sharing tributes to mail carriers, and starting discussions about why the mail is such an important part of American life.

As the coronavirus pandemic continues, the US Postal Service said that it's seen a ""devastating"" drop in revenue and needs funding from Congress to ensure it can keep delivering letters and packages to the millions of Americans currently sheltering at home.

#USPostalService and #saveUSPS were tweeted thousands of times after the Washington Post reported Saturday that President Donald Trump was personally blocking potential emergency funding. According to the Post, Trump threatened to veto a version of the recently passed stimulus package that included a $13 billion bailout for the US Postal Service and instead extended the agency a $10 billion loan. The USPS has been financially troubled for decades, but a drop in its main funding source — first-class and marketing mail — due to the coronavirus pandemic has only worsened its economic outlook.

""We now estimate that the COVID-19 pandemic will increase the Postal Service’s net operating loss by more than $22 billion dollars over the next eighteen months, and by over $54 billion dollars over the longer term, threatening our ability to operate,"" Postmaster General Megan Brennan said in a statement on Friday.

Rep. Gerry Connolly, a Democrat who has led the push to provide USPS with aid, has also said Trump personally blocked potential funding plans.

""Every single one of us will feel the impact if the #USPostalService disappears, @realDonaldTrump,"" Connolly tweeted on Sunday. ""The American people want to #SaveTheUSPS. Whether we can is up to you.""

Some people praised the mail delivery personnel in their lives.

'Uber for blood': how Rwandan delivery robots are saving lives,An ingenious drone delivery service known as “Uber for blood” has slashed the delivery time of life-saving medicine to remote regions of Rwanda from four hours to an average of half an hour.,1.0,"An ingenious drone delivery service known as “Uber for blood” has slashed the delivery time of life-saving medicine to remote regions of Rwanda from four hours to an average of half an hour.

A partnership between Zipline, a Silicon Valley robotics company, and the country’s health ministry has delivered more than 5,500 units of blood over the past year, often in life-saving situations. Never before have patients in the country received blood so quickly and efficiently.



While commercial drone delivery in wealthier countries is still at the testing stage, hampered by busy skies and strict regulations on airspace, Zipline is delivering blood to 12 regional hospitals from a base in the east of Rwanda. Each hospital serves about half a million people.

The use of drones is helping to reduce maternal deaths – a quarter of which are the result of blood loss during childbirth – and high incidences of malaria-induced anaemia, which is common in children.



Drone delivery also means hospitals can store less blood, which means less waste as blood spoils quickly.

Now Zipline plans to work with the government of Tanzania, a country of 56 million people, to launch what it claims is the world’s largest drone delivery network.

Keller Rinaudo, Zipline’s co-founder and chief executive officer, said the move will make east Africa a world leader in drone logistics.

“Some of the biggest, most powerful technology companies in the world are still trying to figure out how to do this. But east Africa is showing them all the way,” he said. “The work in Rwanda has shown the world what’s possible when you make a national commitment to expand healthcare access with drones and help save lives.”

The idea for the drones came during a visit Rinaudo made to the Ifakara health institute in Tanzania, in 2014. He met a graduate student who had built a mobile alert system for health workers to text emergency requests for medicine and vaccines. A network of community health workers used the mobile alert system to make thousands of requests.

But there was a problem – there was no way for the government to fulfil these requests. “It became clear that this was a database of death filled with thousands of names, addresses, ages and phone numbers,” said Rinaudo.

“We’ve designed Zipline to solve the second half of this problem. We know who needs medicine, when and where. And now, we can get them that medicine as quickly as possible.”

This year, the firm aims to deliver a range of medical products – including blood transfusion supplies, HIV medication, antimalarials, sutures and UV tubes – to four bases in Tanzania, supporting more than 1,000 clinics.

In Rwanda, when a doctor or medical staffer at one of the 12 clinics needs blood, they send a WhatsApp message or log on to Zipline’s order site. They are then sent a confirmation message saying a Zip drone is on its way.

The drone flies to the clinic at up to 60mph. When it is within a minute of the destination, the doctor receives a text. The drone then drops the package, attached to a parachute, into a special zone near the clinic before returning to base.

Critics of the scheme in Rwanda have questioned why the authorities have invested in hi-tech schemes when demand for basic infrastructure, roads and health centres still exceeds supply. Zipline and the government have not revealed the cost of the project.

But a spokesman for the Rwandan health ministry said: “The ministry of health and Rwanda Biomedical Center are happy to use such innovative technology to reduce the average delivery time from four hours to less than 45 minutes, with quick and reliable delivery [of] blood products.”",https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/jan/02/rwanda-scheme-saving-blood-drone
New Zealand Discharges Its Last COVID Patient From The Hospital,New Zealand Discharges Its Last COVID Patient From The Hospital | HW English,1.0,"New Zealand has no COVID patients in hospital, the last one is discharged as the nation goes 6 days without any new case. There only 21 active cases.

Auckland| New Zealand has zero COVID-19 patients in the hospital and has not registered a new case for 6 days, the health ministry said today.

The last hospital patient was discharged in Auckland overnight in the latest mark of victory for New Zealand’s internationally-praised response to the pandemic.

New Zealand only confirmed its first case on February 26, but had shut its borders by March 19 and started implementing a complete lockdown on March 26.

The nation’s success means the lockdown could be practically lifted within weeks, with gatherings of up to 100 already allowed and plans being made to resume travel to Australia.

The official tally of 1,504 infections has not moved since last Friday, while the death toll of 21 has not grown since May 6.

The Oceania country has conducted a total of 267,435 COVID tests and contact tracers are operating to monitor the remaining cases through the NZ COVID Tracer app.

New Zealand has managed the outbreak much better than most nations. However, officials are taking their time to drop the alert level from two to one – the least severe level.

In late April, PM Jacinda Ardern said that New Zealand had “won” the fight against widespread community transmission of the virus.

Ardern said that to completely “succeed” in the battle against the COVID-19, the nation must “hunt down” the remaining cases of the virus. “There is no widespread, undetected community transmission in New Zealand. We have won that battle,” said Ardern. “But we must remain vigilant if we are to keep it that way.”",https://hwnews.in/international/new-zealand-discharges-last-covid-patient-hospital/138063

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Nearly 200 countries signed a U.N. resolution in Nairobi on Wednesday to eliminate plastic pollution in the sea, a move some delegates hoped would pave the way to a legally binding treaty.

If current pollution rates continue, there will be more plastic in the sea than fish by 2050, said the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) which organized the meeting.

Eight million tonnes of plastic - bottles, packaging and other waste - are dumped into the ocean every year, killing marine life and entering the human food chain, UNEP added.

“There is very strong language in this resolution,” Norway’s environment minister, Vidar Helgesen, told Reuters.

“We now have an agreement to explore a legally binding instrument and other measures and that will be done at the international level over the next 18 months.”

Norway, which initiated the resolution, has seen the evidence of the damage the pollution causes first hand, he said.

“We found micro plastics inside mussels, which is something we like to eat,” Helgesen added. “In January this year, a fairly rare species of whale was stranded on a beach because of exhaustion and they simply had to kill it. In its tummy they found 30 plastic bags.”

China is the biggest producer of plastic waste but has started making efforts to cut down, UNEP head Erik Solheim said.

For graphic click:

“If there is one nation changing at the moment more than anyone else, it’s China ... the speed and determination of the government to change is enormous,” said Solheim.

Solheim eventually wants to see governments ban and redesign some packaging.

“Let’s abolish products that we do not need ... if you go to tourist places like Bali, a huge amount of the plastic picked from the oceans are actually straws.”

Under the resolution, countries agreed to start monitoring the amount of plastic they put into the ocean. The resolution was signed by all l93 countries that are members of the U.N.

“While this is not a treaty, significant progress is being made ... 39 governments announced new commitments to reduce the amount of plastic going into the sea,” said the chief of public advocacy at UNEP, Sam Barrat.

“Chile, Oman, Sri Lanka and South Africa today ... announced measures including plastic bag bans, new marine reserves and drives to increase recycling.”",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-environment-un-pollution/more-than-200-nations-promise-to-stop-ocean-plastic-waste-idUSKBN1E02F7

A week ago, the boy was homeless, studying chess moves while lying on the floor of a shelter in Manhattan. Now Tani, as he is known, has a home, a six-figure bank account, scholarship offers from three elite private schools and an invitation to meet President Bill Clinton.

“I think I am still dreaming,” said Tani’s dad, Kayode Adewumi. “I hope I don’t wake up.”

A Nigerian refugee who had learned chess only a bit more than a year earlier, he had just defeated kids from elite private schools to win the New York state chess championship for his age group. He lugged a trophy nearly as big as he is back to the homeless shelter.

Now the story gets even better.

After my column about this hard-working family, a GoFundMe drive raised more than $200,000 for Tani, his parents and his brother.

"More than a million people in the UK have quit smoking since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, new study shows","More than a million people in the UK have quit smoking since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, new study shows",1.0,"More than one million people in the UK have given up smoking since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a new study by the nonprofit Action on Smoking and Health.

Almost half (41%) said it was a direct response to heightened health concerns during the coronavirus pandemic.

The study also found that older people are quitting at slower rates than younger people, despite being categorized in the more vulnerable group.

""I don't want to be one of those people in a ward with an oxygen mask over my face struggling to tell my loved ones what I'm feeling,"" one recent quitter told Business Insider.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

Before the coronavirus pandemic hit, Saurav Dutt smoked up to six cigarettes a day.

The 38-year-old author from London first took up the habit as a way to unwind from college exams. But as the years went by he found that it helped him focus, and it became essential to his writing process.

""Smoking inspires my writing ... and drives me out of dark moods when I hit writer blocks or doubt my efforts,"" Dutt told Business Insider.

But as COVID-19 gripped the world, Dutt — who had tried quitting in the past, but never managed to do so — decided it was finally time to give up.

So, after 18 years of smoking, he quit.

""I don't want to be one of those people in a ward with an oxygen mask over my face struggling to tell my loved ones what I'm feeling,"" Dutt said. ""COVID-19 has brought the issue of personal health into focus for me like never before.""

He is not alone. According to a recent survey by the UK charity Action on Smoking and Health (ASH), conducted between April 15 to June 20, more than one million people in Britain have given up smoking.

Of those poeple, almost half (41%) said it was a direct response to heightened health concerns during the coronavirus pandemic, the study added. COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, has so far killed more than 700,000 people worldwide.

Their reaction is understandable: COVID-19 is known to attack the respiratory system first, with symptoms including a bad cough and shortness of breath.

Smokers may have higher risk of getting severe coronavirus symptoms

In the last few months, researchers have been trying to find out how strong the link between smokers and severe coronavirus cases really is.

A recent study by The Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco found that smokers are nearly twice as likely to develop severe coronavirus symptoms.

The research examined more than 11,000 COVID-19 patients and found that about 30% of those who had a history of smoking saw their conditions progress to a more severe or critical state.

Another study published last month by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, found that one in three young adults between the ages of 18 and 25 are at higher risk of having severe COVID-19 cases, with smoking habits playing a big part.

Patients are considered vulnerable if they have at least one risk factor set out by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), including health conditions and smoking habits.

More young people are giving up smoking

Younger smokers appear to be giving up smoking at a much higher rate than their older counterparts.

The study by ASH found that of the 1 million people who quit between April and June, 400,000 were aged between 16 and 25.

""For young people who have been quitting, there's a desire to generally be more healthy, and take control at a time in their lives where that control has been taken away,"" Hazel Cheeseman, the policy dierctor for ASH told Business Insider.

""Younger people are more likely to be in employment that's been disrupted, or have their education or social lives disrupted. Their lives have been much more affected by the experience of lockdown, whereas older people have been in their own homes and maintained their own space.""

Cheeseman said that ASH's findings have been ""surprising"" considering it is older people who are more at risk of contracting the coronavirus.

""Older smokers have been smoking longer because most people start in their teens. They're therefore more likely to be more heavily addicted and therefore quitting is more difficult for them,"" she said.

""But they are also more insulated from some of the factors that have motivated people to quit right now.""

While the survey results showed a sign of short-term success for smokers giving up, it remains to be seen if this translates into a continued pattern.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has also warned that the disease poses particular risks to smokers.

At a press briefing in July, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: ""Smoking kills 8 million people a year, but if users need more motivation to kick the habit, the pandemic provides the right incentive.""

That incentive has worked for Dutt. He said that while it hasn't been easy, he knows that it's for the better.

""Quitting has been incredibly difficult but nearing 40, the reality of looking after one's health is more important than ever, and I am no longer willing to allow a drug to rule my life,"" Dutt said.",https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-smokers-quit-record-numbers-study-2020-8

Subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on news you need to know.

KUALA LUMPUR, Sept 4 — The government will not allow any more expansion of oil palm plantations in the country, Primary Industries Minister Teresa Kok said today.

She said Malaysia's forest cover was over 50 per cent and the government was committed to maintaining it.

“We are committed to maintain at least 50 per cent of the land as forest cover, so we won’t allow any expansion of these oil palm plantations,” she said after her keynote address during the Corporate Malaysia Summit this afternoon at the Sime Darby Convention Centre here.

Asked the impact of the government decision on its long-term revenue, Kok said the decision will be up to palm oil producing companies.

She noted the glut in palm oil supply worldwide due to overproduction by Malaysia and Indonesia. The two countries are the biggest producers of palm oil globally.

“The situation now is, there is excess palm oil supplies, here and in Indonesia.

“In the long run, we will let the individual plantation companies decide if they want to maintain their land as palm oil estates or harvest different crops,” she said.

She added that several companies were already mulling converting their estates into coconut plantation farms.

Kok was elaborating on an earlier statement that the local palm oil industry is looking to broaden its market internationally.

She also said her ministry is hopes all existing palm oil traders can achieve 100 per cent Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil (MSPO) certification by December 31 next year.

“This will be challenging as only 20 per cent or around one million hectares are currently registered,” she said.

Kok said ministry had already contacted Felda and the Sabah Parti Warisan-led government to hold talks on educating rural traders on standard guidelines.

“We are going to move fast, especially with the planters in the interior section of the certain states where the aim is to educate them on the standards they would need to comply to raise the marketability of their product.

“We want to explain to the planters the importance in making first class or five-star standard palm oil.

“And we have to make sure that all planters even the small ones are accepted and not marginalised, and they need the MSPO certification first to be accepted,” she said.",https://www.malaymail.com/s/1669208/teresa-kok-govt-to-stop-oil-palm-expansion-keep-50pc-land-as-forest

"This Woman Has Rescued 72,000 Human Trafficking Victims","This Woman Has Rescued 72,000 Human Trafficking Victims",1.0,"Hasina Kharbhih’s Impulse NGO Network has used an innovative model to rescue 72,000 women and children trafficked across India, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Nepal.

Her innovative model partners with human rights organizations and governments across Asia and Europe, and stands out for its emphasis on financial compensations and repatriation.

Ella Sangma was in her early teens and living in a shelter in New Delhi when the authorities told her someone was coming to take her back to northeast India. “I was doubtful; I had been taken for a ride earlier,” says Sangma, who was sold by her mother to human traffickers as a child and brought to the Indian capital, where she was forced to keep the books at a liquor store connected to a brothel.

But there was something about Hasina Kharbhih that earned the teen’s instant trust. Sangma, who now calls Kharbhih Amma (mother), agreed to return to northeast India with her. Sangma is just one among the more than 72,000 women and children who have been victims of human trafficking across India, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Nepal and now find themselves free thanks to Kharbhih.

For Kharbhih, 49, it’s a matter of empathy as she strives to put a dent in the $32 billion human trafficking industry in India and its surrounding countries. When I arrive at a British-era building in Shillong in the northeast Indian hill state of Meghalaya, Kharbhih — wearing a traditional wraparound skirt and her hair in a bun — welcomes me into her office library.

Children were being taken away by recruiters who promised them better-paying jobs and put them into forced labor as domestic maids, tea stall helpers, miners or sex slaves. Hasina Kharbhih

Kharbhih was just a schoolgirl in Shillong when she started supporting the social development of vulnerable communities in the northeast. The area is rife with human trafficking due to its porous borders with Nepal, Myanmar and Bangladesh; rampant poverty; and clashes between locals and the Indian military. During the 1971 war that resulted in the formation of Bangladesh, Kharbhih’s father housed refugees in their farmhouse.

“I was born the year these people got to go back, but the stories remain etched in my brain,” Kharbhih says. “He did that as a human being and not a social worker — and maybe that got into me. I understood what you can do for human beings.”

While in school, she started cooking and cleaning at retirement homes and orphanages. That early volunteer work became the Impulse NGO Network. Kharbhih decided to go to a college with stacked early-morning classes, which gave her more time for social work than a social life. By 1993, Impulse was registered as a rural livelihood initiative for female artisans in the East Khasi Hills district of Meghalaya.

The initiative’s focus shifted after a 1996 Supreme Court of India order banning the felling of trees in the northeast. While conservationists celebrated, the ruling came as a devastating blow for many female artisans — including those adjacent to the village where Kharbhih’s grandmother lived — who depended on access to bamboo and cane for their weaving.

“The forest resources ban forced the rural communities to seek employment in urban areas, and that eventually led many to become victims of human trafficking,” Kharbhih says in her trademark soft, calm voice. “We found that children were being taken away by recruiters who promised them better-paying jobs and put them into forced labor as domestic maids, tea stall helpers, miners or sex slaves.”

She reoriented the organization to tackle the spiraling problem. In 2000, Impulse took on its first human trafficking case after Prerana, a Mumbai-based nongovernmental organization, rescued three northeastern girls from a red-light district in the city.

Impulse’s immediate challenge was how to work with the government. And for that, it needed a plan of action. That turned out to be what is now called the Meghalaya Model, or the Impulse Model. The trafficking tracking system focuses on the six R’s (reporting, rescue, rehabilitation, repatriation, reintegration and restitution) and the six P’s (partnership, prevention, protection, policing, press and prosecution).

Karbhih’s tracking center works with 1,000 nongovernmental organizations and governmental departments across South and Southeast Asia and has been endorsed by the United Kingdom. Anyone can report a case to the Impulse Case Info Centre (ICIC), which quickly connects local authorities and NGOs.

Once a rescue operation is carried out, ICIC collaborates with social welfare departments and NGOs to provide shelter, medical care and a long-term plan. whether that’s vocational training or returning the person home. And they follow up to make sure trafficking survivors receive financial compensation.

Ajailiu Niumai, a professor of sociology at the University of Hyderabad who researches human trafficking in northeast India, believes that what makes Kharbhih’s model different from others across India are the components of repatriation and financial compensation. “Besides,” Niumai adds, “Impulse has been able to take their model to the global platform by connecting with the organizations across South Asia and also Europe.”

But Niumai also points out that there are regional factors at play. “What is possible in the hills of the northeast is actually more difficult in the urban regions of, for example, south India,” she says. “Here, down south, families are not willing to take back trafficked victims. So there are a lot more cases of re-trafficking.”

The best thing about Kharbhih, Sangma tells me, is the way she listens to survivors and incorporates feedback to evolve the system. When Sangma became the only survivor to testify in court against a human trafficker, Kharbhih was always with her, flying back and forth between Meghalaya and New Delhi.

Sangma emerged from the courtroom to find Kharbhih, and had a simple request for her Amma — to run away. So the pair did just that, running miles and miles through the streets of Delhi, in the hopes that, even if just for a moment, Sangma could feel safe.",https://www.ozy.com/around-the-world/she-has-rescued-72000-victims-of-human-trafficking/321595/

India just banned all forms of disposable plastic in its capital,India just banned all forms of disposable plastic in its capital,1.0,"India’s capital city Delhi has introduced a ban on disposable plastic.

Cutlery, bags, cups and other forms of single-use plastic were prohibited by the National Green Tribunal (NGT).

There is particular concern in the country about the amount of plastic waste it produces. According to the Times of India, it is one of the top four polluters in the world.

The ban affects the whole National Capital Territory (NCT) area of Delhi.

It was introduced after complaints about the illegal mass burning of plastic and other waste at three local rubbish dumps, which has been blamed for causing air pollution. The sites are supposed to operate as waste-to-energy plants.

The Tribunal said in a statement: “Each of these sites is a depiction of the mess that can be created for environment and health of people of Delhi.

“We direct that use of disposable plastic is prohibited in entire NCT of Delhi.

“The Delhi government shall take steps for storage and use of plastic materials.”

The ban came into force at the start of this month.

“All the corporations … and other public authorities, including NCT of Delhi, are directed to take immediate steps for reduction and utilisation of dumped waste,” the Tribunal added.

Dozens of elephants 'set free' as chairs used to carry tourists are scrapped in wake of COVID-19 downturn,78 elephants in Thailand permanently freed from carrying tourists because of COVID-19,1.0,"Dozens of elephants were set free this morning (March 25) as their owners scrapped the heavy wooden chairs that are tied to their backs for carrying tourists. The jumbos at the Maesa elephant camp in Chiang Mai, northern Thailand, have been giving rides to holidaymakers for 44 years but the Covid-19 coronavirus has decimated tourism. With no end to the pandemic in sight and a ban on such businesses opening, owners have decided to scrap the huge wooden and metal carriages that are strapped to the elephants' backs throughout the day. Camp director Anchalee Kalampichit said this was the first time in 44 years that the elephants had not worn the seats at the start of the day. She said the company will now change their business to allow the elephants to roam freely in the grounds and operate as a place for visitors to observe the animals - and all 78 of the jumbos will never have to wear them again. She said: ""Since we entered the business in 1976, riding on the elephants has always been the favourite activity of tourists. ""But because the coronavirus has spread there have been fewer tourists and eventually the government ordered us to close so we have removed the chairs to liberate the elephants. ""We are not planning to put the seat supports back on the elephants, even if we can operate again. We want to change the style of the place and find more natural ways that the public can enjoy the elephants. ""We will welcome tourists to enjoy learning about the elephants' ways of life naturally instead of using them to entertain the tourists."" Anchalee added that the government enforced closure of the elephant camp, along with 28 other types of non-essential customer-facing businesses, means that the owners will have to take care of the animals without any revenue from customers. She said: ""The cost for taking care of the 78 elephants and 300 staff is five million THB (130,399GBP) per month. So for now, we have to bear that expense without income from tourists. ""But we will not leave anyone behind and will try to take the best care of the elephants for as long as we can. Now we are planting vegetables for the staff to eat as one of the ways we can reduce the expenses."" In Chiang Mai, where there are 93 elephant camps of varying size, officials said that 85 of them were facing closure unless the situation improved. Boontha Chailert, president of the Chiang Mai Tourism Business Association and the Maetaeng Elephant Park, said hundreds of other elephant centres around Thailand were also facing closure due to the lack of tourists.",https://www.yahoo.com/news/dozens-elephants-set-free-chairs-090000522.html

Australian man Tony Lethbridge couldn't sleep. It was early Monday morning and his 17-year-old son Samuel was missing.

It had been almost 24 hours since anyone had heard from him.

It was out of character and his family feared the worst.

SUPPLIED Emergency services attempting to free Samuel Lethbridge from his vehicle.

A few hours earlier, after a series of unanswered calls to Samuel's mobile, Tony and his wife, Lee, had left Canberra and driven home to search for their boy.

""We got back into Newcastle about 1.30am [Monday morning] and went straight to the police station,"" Lethbridge said.

SIMONE DE PEAK/SMH Tony Lethbridge, who found his son's crash site by helicopter.

""They told us that he might have ran away, he could have done this or he could have done that and we just said, 'It's out of character; it's not him'.

""They put all the things in motion and we waited and waited. They just told us to go home and wait.

But Lethbridge could not wait. ""I just couldn't get it out of my head that he'd crashed somewhere,"" he said.

Samuel had been driving back from the Central Coast around 6.30am on Sunday. He had messaged his girlfriend and arranged to meet her at the family home at Blacksmiths after she finished work around lunchtime.

He never arrived.

As Lethbridge's mind raced, he recalled an accident from a few years earlier along the same stretch of the Pacific Highway that he believed Samuel would have been driving on. That driver wasn't found for five days.

""And he'd passed away,"" Lethbridge said. ""That was in my head, so I just thought bugger this I'm not going to sit around and wait.

""With the way the bush is there, if a car goes in you're not going to see it. The only way you'll see it is from the air. And that's what we did.

""I thought, I'm going to get a helicopter no matter what.

""I just rocked in there and said 'Mate, I've got $1000 – I need you to search as much as you can'.

With the cash in his hand, Tony walked into the Lake Macquarie Airport at 9am. On the dot.

Lee Mitchell, of Skyline Aviation Group, said the man looked ""anxious and fatigued"".

""He asked if he could, no - he said, he 'needed a helicopter bad',"" said Mitchell, a helicopter pilot with 18 years' flying experience.

""He told us it was for missing son and said he believed his son had run off the road somewhere.""

The company had cancelled training flights for that morning because of high winds whipping the Hunter Region but it immediately agreed to start the search.

As Lethbridge - who struggles with flying - drove off to go and pick up his brother, the flight crew readied the helicopter.

Lethbridge's brother, Michael, took the flight while Lethbridge and his wife waited for news from the family home at Blacksmiths. It didn't take long.

Within 10 minutes, they received news that a car fitting the description of Samuel's vehicle had been spotted just off the Pacific Highway near Crangan Bay.

Immediately, Tony began the frantic drive out to the site.

The car was buried in deep bushland, and it was unclear from the helicopter if there was anyone inside.

The chopper put Samuel's uncle on the ground near the former Big Prawn service station.

As his uncle made the grim approach to the crash site, the pilot hovered above to provide a reference for Lethbridge and emergency services. ​

Fearing what he might find when he arrived, Samuel's uncle began to call his name as he began the 50-metre walk down to the accident site.

There was no response.

But then Michael Lethbridge spotted Samuel moving his head inside the wreck. At that point, he sent a text message to his brother: ""He's alive"".

""When I got there, I ran down there and it was just jubilation,"" Tony Lethbridge said.

""It was unbelievable, to find him there.""

Trapped in his vehicle for what was nearing 30 hours, Samuel was dehydrated and suffering serious injuries. A broken thigh bone was protruding three inches through the skin.

""You wouldn't have seen him if it wasn't for the helicopter, because I couldn't see him from the road,"" Lethbridge said.

""If the helicopter wasn't hovering above, I would have never had found him.""

Tony said it was likely the car was travelling around ""80kmh"" when it ran off the road and had been totally destroyed. It's believed the car hit a concrete pole – which ripped the driver's side door off – and spun, rolled and luckily, landed on its wheels.

Emergency services arrived on the scene and had to cut the vehicle open to pull Samuel from the wreckage.

Stable and in intensive care on Tuesday afternoon, Samuel had undergone several scans since arriving at John Hunter Hospital.

With a broken arm, dislocated elbow and small fractures ""here and there"" according to his dad, it's expected his recovery will be a long process. Surgery on Wednesday to his arm and leg should heal the most immediate problems.

Samuel was described by his dad as a ""good, tough and very fit kid"" who plays for Belmont-Swansea Football Club in a local under-19's soccer competition.

He had only started an electrical apprenticeship on Friday. That will have to be put on hold.

""He spoke to me when I got down to the car,"" Lethbridge said. ""I grabbed him and I said: 'Mate, dad's got you'.""

Samuel's first words to his father were: ""I'd love a drink"".

""They were the only words he spoke,"" Lethbridge said.",https://www.stuff.co.nz/world/australia/100648218/mate-ive-got-1000-aussie-man-hires-a-chopper-in-frantic-search-to-find-son
This university would rather give up $3 million than destroy its LGBT students group,A university in Alabama gives up a $3 million annual donation rather than destroy its LGBT students group,1.0,"(Facebook)

A Christian university has turned down $3 million in funding from a religious group which came on condition of shutting down an LGBT students group.

Samford University, which was founded by Alabama Baptists, rejected the hefty annual donation from the Alabama Baptist State Convention.

The university has seemingly chosen to support Samford Together, a group in which students can discuss topics relating to sexual orientation and gender identity, over the Christian group.

The Alabama Baptists had threatened to withdraw its contribution if when considering Samford Together, the university’s authorities “decide not to deny permanent recognition and revoke its provisional status”.

Instead of waiting to see if this threat would be fulfilled, Samford has preemptively rejected the donation.

Samford’s president, Andrew Westmoreland, said in a statement announcing the decision that all students must be respected.

“Our actions at Samford, irrespective of financial considerations, must demonstrate fidelity to God’s truth, abiding compassion and respect for all people, and solidarity with the timeless ideals of a strong university.”

After the university gave provisional status to Stamford Together in April, the Baptist group’s representatives John Thweatt and Rick Lance expressed their anti-LGBT views.

“We are saddened by this decision, which provides recognition for an agenda that we believe to be contrary to Scripture,” they said, according to news site Inside Higher Ed.

“We strongly believe that the Old Testament and New Testament each speak unequivocally against homosexuality.

“When addressing same-gender sexual relationships, the Bible without exception never affirms such behavior as an approved lifestyle.”

After the university’s refusal, Shane Windmeyer, executive director of Campus Pride – a national LGBT group for students, said Westmoreland’s move to “stand up” to the Baptist group was brave.

“The decision shows a great deal of courage to tell the [convention]: ‘Well, take your money, we’re going to do what we need to do on our campus’,” he said.

“If Samford wants to be seen as inclusive, safe and accepting, then they should allow this group to exist.

“Are they the worst of the worst? Well, it sounds like the president is willing to stand up and say, ‘You know what, we’re not going to take the money.'”

The university’s annual budget is around $166 million.

Earlier this year, Alabama passed a law permitting anti-LGBT discrimination in adoption cases.",http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/07/20/this-university-would-rather-give-up-3-million-than-destroy-its-lgbt-students-group/?utm_source=ET&utm_medium=ETFB&utm_campaign=portal&utm_content=inf_546_60_1&tse_id=INF_d16691f06d9e11e784dd0bde21677fc8
MIT Will Post Free Plans Online for an Emergency Ventilator That Can Be Built for $100,MIT Will Post Free Plans Online for an Emergency Ventilator That Can Be Built for $100,1.0,"Clinical and design considerations will be published online; goal is to support rapid scale-up of device production to alleviate hospital shortages.

One of the most pressing shortages facing hospitals during the Covid-19 emergency is a lack of ventilators. These machines can keep patients breathing when they no longer can on their own, and they can cost around $30,000 each. Now, a rapidly assembled volunteer team of engineers, physicians, computer scientists, and others, centered at MIT, is working to implement a safe, inexpensive alternative for emergency use, which could be built quickly around the world.

The team, called MIT E-Vent (for emergency ventilator), was formed on March 12, 2020, in response to the rapid spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. Its members were brought together by the exhortations of doctors, friends, and a sudden flood of mail referencing a project done a decade ago in the MIT class 2.75 (Medical Device Design). Students working in consultation with local physicians designed a simple ventilator device that could be built with about $100 worth of parts. They published a paper detailing their design and testing, but the work ended at that point. Now, with a significant global need looming, a new team, linked to that course, has resumed the project at a highly accelerated pace.

The key to the simple, inexpensive ventilator alternative is a hand-operated plastic pouch called a bag-valve resuscitator, or Ambu bag, which hospitals already have on hand in large quantities. These are designed to be operated by hand, by a medical professional or emergency technician, to provide breaths to a patient in situations like cardiac arrest, until an intervention such as a ventilator becomes available. A tube is inserted into the patient’s airway, as with a hospital ventilator, but then the pumping of air into the lungs is done by squeezing and releasing the flexible pouch. This is a task for skilled personnel, trained in how to evaluate the patient and adjust the timing and pressure of the pumping accordingly.

The innovation begun by the earlier MIT class, and now being rapidly refined and tested by the new team, was to devise a mechanical system to do the squeezing and releasing of the Ambu bag, since this is not something that a person could be expected to do for any extended period. But it is crucial for such a system to not damage the bag and to be controllable, so that the amount of air and pressures being delivered can be tailored to the particular patient. The device must be very reliable, since an unexpected failure of the device could be fatal, but as designed by the MIT team, the bag can be immediately operated manually.

The team is particularly concerned about the potential for well-meaning but inexperienced do-it-yourselfers to try to reproduce such a system without the necessary clinical knowledge or expertise with hardware that can operate for days; around 1 million cycles would be required to support a ventilated patient over a two-week period. Furthermore, it requires code that is fault-tolerant, since ventilators are precision devices that perform a life-critical function. To help curtail the spread of misinformation or poorly-thought-out advice, the team has added to their website verified information resources on the clinical use of ventilators and the requirements for training and monitoring in using such systems. All of this information is freely available at e-vent.mit.edu.

“We are releasing design guidance (clinical, mechanical, electrical/controls, testing) on a rolling basis as it is developed and documented,” one team member says. “We encourage capable clinical-engineering teams to work with their local resources, while following the main specs and safety information, and we welcome any input other teams may have.”

The researchers emphasize that this is not a project for typical do-it-yourselfers to undertake, since it requires specialized understanding of the clinical-technical interface, and the ability to work in consideration of strict U.S. Food and Drug Administration specifications and guidelines.

Such devices “have to be manufactured according to FDA requirements, and should only be utilized under the supervision of a clinician,” a team member said. “The Department of Health and Human Services released a notice stating that all medical interventions related to Covid-19 are no longer subject to liability, but that does not change our burden of care.” he said. “At present, we are awaiting FDA feedback” about the project. “Ultimately, our intent is to seek FDA approval. That process takes time, however.”

The all-volunteer team is working without funding and operating anonymously for now because many of them have already been swamped by inquiries from people wanting more information, and are concerned about being overwhelmed by calls that would interfere with their work on the project. “We would really, really like to just stay focused,” says one team member. “And that’s one of the reasons why the website is so essential, so that we can communicate with anyone who wants to read about what we are doing, and also so that others across the world can communicate with us.”

“The primary consideration is patient safety. So we had to establish what we’re calling minimum clinical functional requirements,” that is, the minimum set of functions that the device would need to perform to be both safe and useful, says one of the team members, who is both an engineer and an MD. He says one of his jobs is to translate between the specialized languages used by the engineers and the medical professionals on the team.

That determination of minimum requirements was made by a team of physicians with broad clinical backgrounds, including anesthesia and critical care, he says. In parallel, the group set to work on designing, building, and testing an updated prototype. Initial tests revealed the high loads that actual use incurs, and some weaknesses that have already been addressed so that, in the words of team co-leads, “Even the professor can kick it across the room.” In other words, early attempts focused on super “makability” were too optimistic.

New versions have already been fabricated and are being prepared for additional functional tests. Already, the team says there is enough detailed information on their website to allow other teams to work in parallel with them, and they have also included links to other teams that are working on similar design efforts.

In under a week the team has gone from empty benches to their first realistic tests of a prototype. One team member says that in the less than a week full they have been working, motivated by reports of doctors already having to ration ventilators, and the intense focus the diverse group has brought to this project, they have already generated “multiple theses worth” of research.

The cross-disciplinary nature of the group has been crucial, one team member says. “The most exciting times and when the team is really moving fast are when we have an a design engineer, sitting next to a controls engineer, sitting next to the fabrication expert, with an anesthesiologist on WebEx, all solid modeling, coding, and spreadsheeting in parallel. We are discussing the details of everything from ways to track patients’ vital signs data to the best sources for small electric motors.”

The intensity of the work, with people putting in very long hours every day, has been tiring but hasn’t dulled their enthusiasm. “We all work together, and ultimately the goal is to help people, because people’s lives understandably hang in the balance,” he said.

Single Dad Adopts Girl With Down Syndrome Rejected by 20 Families,Single Dad Adopts Girl With Down Syndrome Rejected by 20 Families,1.0,"Sponsored by Entenmann’s.

It’s been a long, tough year of “unprecedented times,” and dads and father figures have been stepping it up big-time for their families. Whether they locked into remote learning with a middle schooler, switched to working from home when their kid’s daycare closed, or helped keep the house from falling apart (literally), dads have been a huge support throughout this wild ride of a year. And with Father’s Day on the horizon, Entenmann’s is running a fun contest to help you say thanks to the phenomenal father figure in your life.

Wait — Did You Say “Contest”?

Not that dads are competitive or anything, but yes — Entenmann’s is celebrating father figures with their EntenMAN of the Year Father’s Day Contest. The incredible grand prize package includes free Entenmann’s donuts for a year and a VIP all-expenses-paid Daytona Race Trip Package featuring tickets to attend the 2022 races in Daytona, FL, lodging and airfare, and a $1,000 Visa Gift Card for trip expenses and more. Whether they’re coaching soccer practice or crushing silly voices during bedtime reading or giving endless extra pushes on the swings at the park, dads are pretty much the best. Now you just need to tell Entenmann’s all about your favorite father figure.

Who Can Enter?

Of course, being a biological father doesn’t necessarily equate to being a dad. And sometimes the person you admire most as a father figure isn’t necessarily the person you call dad. Being a dad isn’t about blood-relation — it’s about being there for you.

So who qualifies for the EntenMAN of the Year Father’s Day Contest? Whoever tied your cleats for little league or taught you to change a tire. Whoever helped you learn to drive or mentored you through that awkward phase in high school. Or maybe you have a brother or friend who’s done something amazing as a father, and you think he deserves some recognition. Maybe your wife or internet-savvy kid wants to nominate you!

You can nominate any father figure in your life (male or female) who you think deserves to be EntenMAN of the Year. This contest is all about celebrating the rock stars who make our worlds better, brighter, and funnier. So, whoever stands out to you is the person you should put in the running to be EntenMAN of the Year.

What Does The Winner Get?

Love and admiration is the true reward. But, okay, prizes are awesome too — and the grand prize winner of the EntenMAN of the Year Father’s Day Contest is getting a pile of them. For starters, the winner and three guests will get a Race Trip package to Daytona, Florida that includes roundtrip airfare, five nights in a hotel, four pre-race Pit passes, four Cup Grandstand tickets, four Xfinity Grandstand Tickets, four Truck Series Grandstand Tickets, and the winner’s name will replace the driver’s name above the door of the #37 car at the race in Michigan later this year. On top of all that, they also get a $1,000 Visa gift card for expenses on the trip, and DONUTS FOR A YEAR (which immediately makes it the best year ever).

Fear not — there are more winners than just the grand prize. The first prize winner will get an autographed driver fire suit and donuts for a year. Three other finalists will get donuts for a year, and the five nominators (that’s you!) of the finalists will also get donuts for a year. Score!

Sounds Awesome — I’m In. What’s Next?

Throw your chosen father figure’s hat into the ring by going to www.entenmanoftheyear.com and submit some basic contact info as well as your relationship to the nominee, plus a short 250-word essay about why you think he or she deserves to be crowned EntenMAN of the Year. We promise it’ll be a breeze compared to assembling a child’s bike.

This is a fantastic way to remind ourselves of some of the qualities and achievements we may sometimes take for granted about the amazing father figures in our lives. And even if your nominee doesn’t win the grand prize, you can still show them your appreciation this Father’s Day by gifting them some donuts. Because nothing says “You’re the best dad ever” like donuts.

Nominate your favorite father figure to be Entenmann’s EntenMAN of the Year, by giving them the opportunity to win the ultimate Father’s Day gift — a race trip package to Daytona, Florida and so much more.",https://www.thedad.com/single-dad-adopts-girl-with-down-syndrome-rejected-by-20-families/
CRIME VICTIM COMPENSATION: An Overview,For anybody who was a victim of a violent crime such as Las Vegas there is in every state a victims compensation program that will compensate for medical bills or funeral expenses. For those who are worried about finances this can ease some or all of that burden.,1.0,"Return to Documents -- Quarterly Newsletter

CRIME VICTIM COMPENSATION: An Overview

Crime victim compensation programs across the country offer crucial financial assistance to victims of violence. This overview provides information on how the programs operate and what victims can do to seek help.

Victims of violent crime may suffer financial stress as devastating as their physical injuries and emotional trauma. Recovering from violence or abuse is difficult enough without having to worry about how to pay for the costs of medical care and counseling, or about how to replace lost income due to disability or death.

The good news is that every state has a crime victim compensation program that can provide substantial financial assistance to crime victims and their families. And while no amount of money can erase the trauma and grief victims suffer, this aid can be crucial in the aftermath of crime. By paying for care that helps restore victims' physical and mental health, and by replacing lost income for victims who cannot work and for families who lose a breadwinner, compensation programs are assisting victims in direct ways.

Compensation programs are now serving an ever-increasing number of victims with larger amounts of benefits than ever before. Despite a substantial decline in violent crime (there are a third fewer crimes committed each year now, compared to 1993) applications and payouts continue to grow in most states. The national total of benefits is at record-high levels, and programs are addng new compensable costs and expanding outreach to ensure that more victims' needs are met.

Crime victim compensation was the first type of organized victim assistance in the United States. The earliest compensation program was created in 1965 in California, and nine states were operating such programs by 1972, when the earliest programs providing other types of direct victim assistance were established. Today, compensation programs across the country are paying out close to $500 million annually to more than 200,000 victims. Fittingly, most of this money comes from offenders rather than tax dollars, since a large majority of states fund their programs entirely through fees and fines charged against those convicted of crime. Federal grants to compensation programs, providing about 35% of the money for payments to victims, also come solely from offender fines and assessments.

Victims of rape, assault, child sexual abuse, drunk driving, and domestic violence, as well as the families of homicide victims, are all eligible to apply for financial help. Statistics show that victims of assault comprise about half of the claimants for compensation, with more than a third of those claims being paid to domestic violence victims. Child sexual abuse victims comprise 29% of the victims helped by compensation programs. About 10% of benefits overall are paid to families of homicide victims, and 8% goes toward sexual assault victims.

Compensation programs can pay for a wide variety of expenses and losses related to criminal injury and homicide. Beyond medical care, mental health treatment, funerals, and lost wages, a number of programs also cover crime-scene cleanup, travel costs to receive treatment, moving expenses, and the cost of housekeeping and child care if a victim is unable to perform those tasks. And states continue to work with victims and advocates to find new ways to help victims with more of the costs of recovery.

While each state operates under its own law, all compensation programs have the same basic criteria to determine eligibility for benefits. It is very important, however, to check with the individual state to see exactly what its requirements are (and the Program Directory on this Website can be useful in doing that). Generally, the victim must (a) report the crime promptly to law enforcement, and cooperate with police and prosecutors (many states allow exceptions to this requirement, particularly for child victims); (b) submit a timely victim compensation application (again, some exceptions may be possible); (c) have a cost or loss not covered by insurance or another government benefit program (victim compensation programs pay only after other collateral sources are used); and (d) not have committed a criminal act or some substantially wrongful act that caused or contributed to the crime (the eligibility of family members generally depends on the behavior of the victim when programs assess this requirement). Apprehension or conviction of the offender is not required.

Maximum benefits available from the states average $25,000, with some states able to offer more, and some states having lower limits. Lower caps within the maximum are common for some types of benefits, like funeral and burial costs, mental health counseling, or lost wages.

Telling victims about compensation is the responsibility of every individual who works in victim services and law enforcement. This resource also should be made known by those who provide medical and counseling services. Compensation programs depend largely on these professionals who work with victims daily to get the message out that financial assistance is available, and programs typically expend a great deal of time and effort in providing training and information to them. We encourage everyone with a role in helping victims to get more details from the program in their state by contacting it directly.",http://www.nacvcb.org/index.asp?bid=14
How a shampoo bottle is saving young lives,"Last year 920,000 children died of pneumonia, mostly in countries without access to expensive medical care. Now an Indian doctor has fashioned and artificial respirator out of shampoo bottles. It has been routinely deployed in his hospital, and infant pneumonia deaths have dropped by 75%.",1.0,"Listen to this story Your browser does not support the <audio> element. Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.

ON HIS first night as a trainee paediatrician in Sylhet, Bangladesh, Mohamad Chisti (pictured above) watched three children die of pneumonia. Oxygen was being delivered to them, through a face mask or via tubes placed near their nostrils, using what is called a basic “low-flow” technique which followed World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines for low-income countries. But it was clearly failing. He decided to find a better way.

Last year 920,000 children under the age of five died of pneumonia, making it the leading killer of people in that age group. This figure is falling (in 2011 it was 1.2m), but it still represents 16% of all infant deaths. Such deaths are not, however, evenly distributed. In Bangladesh pneumonia causes 28% of infant mortality.

Pneumonia is a result of bacterial, viral or fungal infection of the lungs. Its symptoms of breathlessness result from a build-up of pus in the alveoli. These are tiny sacs, found at the ends of the branching airways within the lungs, that are richly infused with capillary blood vessels. They are the places where oxygen enters the bloodstream and carbon dioxide leaves it. Stop the alveoli doing their job and a patient will suffocate.

Pneumonia is particularly threatening to malnourished children—which many in Bangladesh are. First, malnourishment debilitates the immune system, making infection more likely. Second, to keep its oxygen levels up and its CO 2 levels down, a child with pneumonia breathes faster and faster. But this takes a lot of energy, so undernourished infants do not have the ability to keep such an effort up for long. Dr Chisti’s device is designed to reduce the effort required to breathe, and to do so cheaply. (The reason for the WHO’s recommended approach in poor countries is that the sort of ventilator routinely available in the rich world costs around $15,000. But low-flow oxygen delivery does not reduce the effort required to breathe.)

His invention was inspired by something he saw while visiting Australia. On this trip he was introduced to a type of ventilator called a bubble-CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure), which is employed to help premature babies breathe. It channels the infant’s exhaled breath through a tube that has its far end immersed in water. The exhaled breath emerges from the tube as bubbles, and the process of bubble formation causes oscillations of pressure in the air in the tube. These feed back into the child’s lungs. That improves the exchange of gases in the alveoli and also increases the lungs’ volume. Both make breathing easier.

At about $6,000, standard bubble-CPAPs are cheaper than conventional ventilators. But that is still too much for many poor-country hospitals. However, after a second piece of serendipitous inspiration, when he picked up a discarded shampoo bottle that contained leftover bubbles, Dr Chisti realised he could probably lash together something that did the same job. Which he did, using an oxygen supply (which is, in any case, needed for the low-flow oxygen delivery method), some tubing and a plastic bottle filled with water. And it worked.

In 2015 he and his colleagues published the results of a trial that they had conducted in the institution where he practises, the Dhaka Hospital of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research. This showed that the method had potential. The hospital now deploys it routinely and the number of children who die there from pneumonia has fallen by three-quarters. That means the survival rate in the Dhaka Hospital is today almost on a par with that of children treated in rich-world facilities, using conventional ventilators.

Dr Chisti says that, as well as saving lives, his device has cut the hospital’s spending on pneumonia treatment by nearly 90%. The materials needed to make his version of a bubble-CPAP ventilator cost a mere $1.25. The device also consumes much less oxygen than a conventional ventilator. In 2013 the hospital spent $30,000 on supplies of the gas. In 2017 it spent $6,000.

The idea is spreading. Dr Chisti and his team are about to start trials of the new ventilator in a group of hospitals in Ethiopia. If it works as well there as it does in Dhaka, it will surely be taken up elsewhere. All in all, the Chisti bottle-based ventilator shows what can be achieved by stripping an idea down to its basic principles. Effectiveness, it neatly demonstrates, need not always go hand in hand with high tech.",https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2018/09/08/how-a-shampoo-bottle-is-saving-young-lives
Royal Caribbean sends cruise ship to help evacuate people from Puerto Rico,Royal Caribbean sends cruise ship to help evacuate people from Puerto Rico,1.0,"This is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated. Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.

NEW YORK – Royal Caribbean is using a cruise ship to help evacuate people from Puerto Rico and deliver needed supplies to Caribbean islands.

The cruise line announced on Tuesday that it is canceling its September 30 Adventure of the Seas trip so it can use the ship to help victims of Hurricane Maria.

Today Adventure of the Seas will dock in Puerto Rico, the first stop in a series of three to drop off relief supplies & pick up evacuees. https://t.co/u8XyQ9rAwk — Royal Caribbean (@RoyalCaribbean) September 27, 2017

The 3,800 passenger vessel will bring aid to San Juan, as well as St. Croix and St. Thomas, which were hit by both Maria and Hurricane Irma. Adventure arrives in San Juan on Wednesday and will take evacuees to Fort Lauderdale before returning to Puerto Rico next week.

The evacuations come as people remain stranded inside Puerto Rico’s main airport, which is running on fumes. Only ten flights made it in and out of the San Juan airport on Tuesday, and just 18 are scheduled for Wednesday. Security checks are being done by hand because TSA equipment was damaged in the storm and airlines are having a hard time printing boarding passes.

A week after Maria hit, people are desperate for provisions.

Royal Caribbean is donating water, medical supplies and more to those in need.

The company started offering aid after Hurricane Irma devastated a wide swath of the Caribbean earlier this month. So far, it has helped evacuate more than 1,700 people and has promised to match donations of up to $1 million to help with Irma relief.

Other cruise lines are also pitching in.

Norwegian Cruise Line is working with the disaster relief group All Hands Volunteers to help rebuild schools and infrastructure in Puerto Rico. The company is donating $600,000 toward rebuilding efforts in the Florida Keys and the Caribbean, and has promised to match up to $1.25 million in donations to All Hands Volunteers and Happy Heart Fund’s relief efforts from its guests, team members and partners.

Following Hurricane Irma, Carnival deployed 11 ships to bring supplies to islands in the Caribbean. The ships have been making stops in Antigua and St. Kitts to drop off deliveries to Barbuda and St. Maarten during regular cruise trips.

In addition to making donations, Carnival Corporation joined the Micky and Madeleine Arison Family Foundation and Miami HEAT Charitable Fund in pledging up to $10 million in funding and support for Florida and the Caribbean following Irma.

"South Korea to provide 10,000 face masks to help Navajo veterans fight coronavirus","South Korea to provide 10,000 face masks to help Navajo veterans fight coronavirus",1.0,"Stars and Stripes is making stories on the coronavirus pandemic available free of charge. See other free reports here. Sign up for our daily coronavirus newsletter here. Please support our journalism with a subscription.

SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea will provide 10,000 masks and hand sanitizer to help Navajo veterans of the 1950-53 Korean War fight the coronavirus, the government said Monday.

It was the latest in a series of humanitarian shipments from South Korea to foreign veterans ahead of the 70th anniversary of the June 25 start of the war that pitted the United States and the South against the communist-backed North.

The Navajo Nation has been one of the hardest-hit communities in the United States, with coronavirus infection rates rivaling those of New York City.

Health authorities have reported 3,912 positive cases and 140 deaths on the desert reservation, which covers parts of New Mexico, Arizona and Utah, and has a population of 175,000.

South Korea’s Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs said it was “sending protective items including 10,000 masks to the hidden heroes of the Korean War in the Navajo Nation for the people who are hit especially hard by COVID-19,” the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus.

About 800 Navajo men served in the war, many as Code Talkers who used their native language as an unbreakable code to confound opposing forces. Around 130 of the Navajo veterans are still alive, the ministry said.

The 70th Anniversary of the Korean War Commemoration Committee will deliver the masks and hand sanitizers to the veterans and their loved ones as an expression of gratitude for their contribution, according to a press release.

The items were originally supposed to be delivered on Monday, but the date has been delayed. Officials said they plan to hand them over sometime this week with the assistance of the South Korean consulate in Los Angeles, the Korean community in Arizona and the Korean Missionary Association in America.

“We hope our small gifts will console the veterans in the midst of the COVID-10 crisis,” said committee co-chairman Kim Eun-gi. “The government remembers those who made a noble sacrifice to defend a strange country 70 years ago, and we hope they will proudly tell their posterity about the choice they made so many years ago.”

Earlier this month, the committee sent 1 million masks to benefit all foreign veterans of the war, including 500,000 to the Department of Veterans Affairs for American vets.

"Rep. Burchett set up a line for those 'feeling overwhelmed.' So far, he's gotten 1,000 calls.",Tennessee congressman sets up phone line to talk to people experiencing anxiety and depression,1.0,"A few days ago, Rep. Tim Burchett received a call from a woman in her 30s from Illinois. She told him news about the coronavirus pandemic was starting to overwhelm her.

Congressmen are used to hearing from constituents. It's part of the job.

But the woman got in touch directly with Burchett via a cellphone number he shared on Twitter. Burchett recommended she go for a walk outside, while also maintaining social distancing guidelines. She did.

Hers was just one among the 1,000 phone calls and 2,000 text messages to the phone since Monday.

Burchett, who has had friends who have died by suicide, decided he wanted to do something to help people directly. He asked for people who are ""feeling overwhelmed or scared and just want to talk to somebody"" to call him.

Some calls came as late as 1 a.m. Several calls came from other states, even as far out as California and Alaska. Some want to ask him if it's really Burchett himself, but when they hear him answer in his East Tennessee accent, they know.

The last few days, he's received hundreds of calls from the seven counties in his district. The social media-savvy freshman GOP congressman has developed quite a following.

""I've had people call me that are on the edge, and just want to talk, and yeah, some of them don't live in my district, but I don't give a rip,"" Burchett said in a phone interview. ""People are hurting, and they just need somebody to talk to.""

On Thursday, Gov. Bill Lee signed an executive order, mandating Tennesseans stay at home, as the number of coronavirus cases in Tennessee continues to rise.

Physical distancing vs. social distancing

The effects of some of the distancing measures are alarming to mental health professionals.

""In social work, we've been very concerned,"" said Phyllis Thompson, a clinical associate professor and chair of the trauma treatment certificate program at University of Tennessee. ""The biggest concern is changes to behaviors, mental health and, ultimately, suicide.""

The term ""social distancing"" is used to describe the measures being taken to increase the physical space between people. But Laurie Novak, an assistant professor of biomedical informatics at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said the term ""physical distancing"" is more accurate.

""We're not asking people to be less social, we're asking people to be 6 feet apart,"" said Novak, who served as one of 15 members of the National Academy of Medicine's Committee on Health and Medical Dimensions of Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults.

The committee recently released a report titled ""Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Opportunities for the Health Care System."" It looked at the health impact of social isolation and loneliness in adults over 50, and made recommendations for health care organizations.

And in a press briefing March 20, WHO epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove said that physical distance “doesn’t mean that socially we have to disconnect from our loved ones, from our family.”

Importance of social connections

Social connections between humans are important, Thompson said.

""The thing about the connection, they help us feel valued,"" she said. ""And it adds meaning to our lives.""

Katie Dorough Veit, a professor at UT's College of Social Work and a licensed clinical social worker who specializes in anxiety, depression and grief, explained: ""When we see someone, it provides a sense of hope and safety because it lets us know we can be connected with others.""

But access to in-person contact has been limited. The CDC has advised against gatherings of more than 10 people. Bars, restaurants, gyms churches and other staples where people interact socially are closed. This can lead to a feeling of loneliness.

""There is a correlation between feeling lonely and depression and anxiety,"" Dorough Veit said. She added loneliness can add to, ""increased feelings of depressive symptoms, a feeling of hopelessness.""

There is a difference between social isolation and the feeling of loneliness.

""Loneliness is the perception of social isolation, or the subjective feeling of being lonely,"" Novak wrote in an email. ""Social isolation, on the other hand, is the objective lack of (or limited) social contact with others.

""Not all people who feel lonely are socially isolated, and not all people who are isolated feel lonely.""

There can be someone, for example, living with friends or family, but still feeling alone. And there can be another person who is living alone, but doesn’t feel lonely.

Loneliness can also have negative physical effects on people, particularly older adults.

""There is strong evidence that in adults, poor social relationships have been shown to increase the risk of developing coronary heart disease and stroke, and also to an increased risk of dementia,"" Novak wrote.

And as people start feeling lonely, it can lead to changes in behavior because some may turn to negative coping strategies to combat the feeling, Thompson said. The changes can range from how many cigarettes one smokes in a day to how much alcohol one consumes to how one responds to stress — and stressors.

And one stressor is the impact the pandemic is having on the jobs market. The number of unemployment claims has surged for two weeks across the state.

Losing a job already adds stress as people start to worry how to pay their bills and buy supplies. But for many people, ""their professions are wrapped into their identity,"" Thompson said.

""That’s almost a loss of self.""

What to do if feeling lonely

Here are some things Novak, Thompson and Dorough Veit recommendation for people who feel lonely.",https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/2020/04/04/coronavirus-pandemic-tenessee-tim-burchett-mental-health-loneliness-depression/5104937002/
Kroger buys and redirects dairy farmers’ surplus milk to Feeding America food banks,Kroger buys and redirects dairy farmers’ surplus milk to Feeding America food banks,1.0,"Food banks are experiencing surging demand as many Americans struggle to make ends meet during the crisis. According to Feeding America, an estimated 17.1 million additional people will experience food insecurity due to school closures and rising unemployment during the pandemic.

""With so many families struggling with unemployment and food insecurity today, providing access to fresh, nutrient-rich milk has never been more important,""​ said Blake Thompson, chief supply chain officer, Feeding America. ""Kroger's Dairy Rescue Program is keeping America's farmers productive, avoiding unnecessary food waste, and helping families in need.""​

Through its expanded 'Dairy Rescue Program,' Kroger will process (at its facilities in Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, and Texas) and donate dairy farmers' excess fluid milk – one of the most requested but harder to stock items at food banks – to Feeding America food banks and community organizations through the end of August.

""Kroger recognizes the growing need for fresh, highly nutritious food in our community, especially for children as schools remain closed during the pandemic to flatten the curve,""​ said Kroger group vice president of manufacturing, Erin Sharp.

""At a time when dairy farmers have surplus raw milk, we're doubling down on our mission to reduce hunger and waste.""​

Kroger's dairy processing plants and suppliers will be donating an additional 50,000 gallons of milk per month to local food banks and community organizations. Feeding America member food banks and other partners will help transport the gallons and half-gallons to local hunger relief agencies.

""As the COVID-19 pandemic has forced businesses like restaurants and hotels across the country to close, some of America's farmers are left without buyers for their dairy supply. ​Kroger's Dairy Rescue Program is an invaluable resource for the dairy industry during this crisis and beyond, helping distribute and process surplus milk to communities who need it the most,"" ​added ​Heather J. McCann, director of public affairs for Dairy Farmers of America's Mideast Area.

In a similar effort, Publix announced last week that it would purchase and donate 43,500 gallons of milk from southeast dairy farmers in the first week of the initiative (which will run for several weeks).​ “As a food retailer, we have the unique opportunity to bridge the gap between the needs of families and farmers impacted by the coronavirus pandemic,”​ said Publix CEO Todd Jones.​

Dairy industry seeks additional relief​

As the COVID-19 crisis wages on, dairy losses will outpace those for cattle, oil seeds, and feed grain, with the average net cash income loss for a dairy farm projected to be $345,000, according to the National Milk Producers Federation (NMPF).

In the second half of April, the USDA announced its agricultural stimulus plan, which reaffirmed agriculture’s eligibility for small-business loans. Under the plan, up to $2.9bn in payments have been promised to dairy producers. The USDA also pledged $1bn in dairy-product purchases for food-distribution programs.

Despite the welcomed relief plans there's still the lingering concern that the efforts won't be enough to offset the drastic losses dairy farmers are experiencing during the crisis. As outlined by NMPF in a May 1 blog post​​, the organization is concerned that the USDA's loss calculations don’t reflect the full damage dairy will feel going forward, and that a product-purchase program may not be able to buy enough dairy to help bolster markets or meet unprecedented food-bank demands.

""We continue to engage with USDA and allies in Congress to address these, and other, problems as we seek relief adequate to the scale of damage, and we are confident that many of these concerns can be addressed,""​ stated NMPF.",https://www.foodnavigator-usa.com/Article/2020/05/01/Kroger-buys-and-redirects-dairy-farmers-surplus-milk-to-Feeding-America-food-banks
Corona Is The First Major Beer Brand To Test Plastic-Free Six-Pack Rings,Cheers To Corona—It's The First Major Beer Brand To Test Plastic-Free 6-Pack Rings,1.0,"Delish : Eat Like Every Day's the Weekend booksamillion.com $26.40 GET YOURS NOW

Corona recently announced that it will be testing an eco-friendly change in its packaging, making it the first major brand to test 100 percent plastic-free six-pack rings.

According to a press release, the decision came as part of Corona's commitment to an organization called Parley for the Oceans. Together, they plan to ""help protect the world's oceans and beaches from marine plastic pollution.""



Corona's packaging mostly consists of glass and fiberboard, but the beer brand found the commonly used six-pack rings to be an opportunity to help redesign a common source of plastic. The plastic-free rings Corona is testing are made with ""plant-based biodegradable fibers, with a mix of by-product waste and compostable materials."" These rings, rather than ending up in smaller pieces of plastic if not recycled, ""break down into organic material that is not harmful to wildlife.""

Business Wire

The new rings will be tested first in Tulum, Mexico, at the beginning of the year. Let's hope that Corona sets a trend, and plastic-free rings become standard for more beer brands!

EU agrees total ban on bee-harming pesticides,EU agrees total ban on bee-harming pesticides,1.0,"The European Union will ban the world’s most widely used insecticides from all fields due to the serious danger they pose to bees.

The ban on neonicotinoids, approved by member nations on Friday, is expected to come into force by the end of 2018 and will mean they can only be used in closed greenhouses.

Bees and other insects are vital for global food production as they pollinate three-quarters of all crops. The plummeting numbers of pollinators in recent years has been blamed, in part, on the widespread use of pesticides. The EU banned the use of neonicotinoids on flowering crops that attract bees, such as oil seed rape, in 2013.

But in February, a major report from the European Union’s scientific risk assessors (Efsa) concluded that the high risk to both honeybees and wild bees resulted from any outdoor use, because the pesticides contaminate soil and water. This leads to the pesticides appearing in wildflowers or succeeding crops. A recent study of honey samples revealed global contamination by neonicotinoids.

Vytenis Andriukaitis, European commissioner for Health and Food Safety, welcomed Friday’s vote: “The commission had proposed these measures months ago, on the basis of the scientific advice from Efsa. Bee health remains of paramount importance for me since it concerns biodiversity, food production and the environment.”

The ban on the three main neonicotinoids has widespread public support, with almost 5 million people signing a petition from campaign group Avaaz. “Banning these toxic pesticides is a beacon of hope for bees,” said Antonia Staats at Avaaz. “Finally, our governments are listening to their citizens, the scientific evidence and farmers who know that bees can’t live with these chemicals and we can’t live without bees.”

Martin Dermine, at Pesticide Action Network Europe, said: “Authorising neonicotinoids a quarter of a century ago was a mistake and led to an environmental disaster. Today’s vote is historic.”

However, the pesticide manufacturers and some farming groups have accused the EU of being overly cautious and suggested crop yields could fall, a claim rejected by others. “European agriculture will suffer as a result of this decision,” said Graeme Taylor, at the European Crop Protection Association. “Perhaps not today, perhaps not tomorrow, but in time decision makers will see the clear impact of removing a vital tool for farmers.”

The UK’s National Farmers’ Union (NFU) said the ban was regrettable and not justified by the evidence. Guy Smith, NFU deputy president, said: “The pest problems that neonicotinoids helped farmers tackle have not gone away. There is a real risk that these restrictions will do nothing measurable to improve bee health, while compromising the effectiveness of crop protection.”

A spokesman for the UK Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs welcomed the ban, but added: “We recognise the impact a ban will have on farmers and will continue to work with them to explore alternative approaches.” In November, UK environment secretary Michael Gove overturned the UK’s previous opposition to a full outdoor ban.

Neonicotinoids, which are nerve agents, have been shown to cause a wide range of harm to individual bees, such as damaging memory and reducing queen numbers.

But this evidence has strengthened recently to show damage to colonies of bees. Other research has also revealed that 75% of all flying insects have disappeared in Germany and probably much further afield, prompting warnings of “ecological armageddon”.

Prof Dave Goulson, at the University of Sussex, said the EU ban was logical given the weight of evidence but that disease and lack of flowery habitats were also harming bees. “Also, if these neonicotinoids are simply replaced by other similar compounds, then we will simply be going round in circles. What is needed is a move towards truly sustainable farming,” he said.

Some experts are worried that the exemption for greenhouses means neonicotinoids will be washed out into water courses, where they can severely harm aquatic life.



Prof Jeroen van der Sluijs, at the University of Bergen, Norway, said neonicotinoids will also continue to be used in flea treatments for pets and in stables and animal transport vehicles, which account for about a third of all uses: “Environmental pollution will continue.”

The EU decision could have global ramifications, according to Prof Nigel Raine, at the University of Guelph in Canada: “Policy makers in other jurisdictions will be paying close attention to these decisions. We rely on both farmers and pollinators for the food we eat. Pesticide regulation is a balancing act between unintended consequences of their use for non-target organisms, including pollinators, and giving farmers the tools they need to control crop pests.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/apr/27/eu-agrees-total-ban-on-bee-harming-pesticides

'Uniquely American': Senate passes landmark bill to enlarge national parks,US Senate passes landmark bipartisan bill to enlarge national parks,1.0,"Joshua Tree and Death Valley national parks are to be enlarged, and stunning river landscapes in California and Utah will be protected, under new legislation that passed the US Senate on Tuesday.

In all the public lands package sets aside more than a million acres of new wilderness and conservation areas in western states.

The Natural Resources Management Act passed 92-8 in the Republican-controlled Senate, a notable bipartisan effort in an administration marked by conservation rollbacks. Since Donald Trump took office, his administration has shrunk national monuments and put large swaths of land up for oil, gas and mining leases, including on the doorsteps of national monuments, parks and wilderness areas. The bill will go to the Democrat-controlled House next, where it’s likely to pass, and then to the president’s desk.

The new legislation designates 375,500 acres of new wilderness in the southern California desert. Photograph: Bob Wick/Bureau of Land Management

The landmark bill protects nearly 500,000 acres in California alone, including adding 43,000 acres to Death Valley national park and Joshua Tree national park, which was damaged by unsupervised crowds during the recent government shutdown. The bill also designates 375,500 acres of new wilderness in the southern California desert, which is a critical ecosystem for bighorn sheep and desert tortoise and the setting for thousands of years of cultural history, including the Old Spanish Trail, a historic trade route that linked northern New Mexico to Los Angeles.

“Latinos make up nearly 50% of the population in the California desert,” said Maite Arce, the president and CEO of the Hispanic Access Foundation. “Protecting this area is significant to people across many cultures and communities, and it will help strengthen the diverse social fabric of the region.”

As for watersheds, some 30,000 acres adjacent to the Yellowstone River in Montana will be protected from mining, and 100,000 acres of the Umpqua watershed in Oregon, one of the most important areas in the Pacific north-west for salmon and steelhead trout, will be conserved. The bill classifies nearly 620 miles of river as “wild and scenic” – prohibiting, for instance, federal support for dam construction – including the Amargosa River in California, the Green River in Utah and tributaries of the Rogue River in Oregon.

Not least, it renews the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which uses income from offshore oil and gas leasing to safeguard natural areas. During Trump’s first years in office, the Republican-controlled Congress had declined to renew it.

Some conservationists worry that Trump may use the signing of the bill as a bargaining chip in a tussle over other political priorities, although they note that the Senate has clearly demonstrated widespread support for its passage.

“Those lands that were protected today belong to every single American,” said Land Tawney, the Backcountry Hunters and Anglers president and CEO. “This vote signifies that we still care about public lands. We are carrying out the legacy of Theodore Roosevelt, and that is uniquely American.”",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/13/senate-bill-public-lands-national-parks-expanded
Can your cat high-five?,Animal shelters across U.S. teach cats how to high five to make them more attractive for adoption,1.0,"Why are photos and videos of cats high-fiving suddenly popping up on Facebook and Instagram?

Ask Jackson Galaxy, host of Animal Planet’s ""My Cat From Hell.""

Last year, Galaxy launched Cat Pawsitive, a program that encourages animal shelters to teach cats how to do tricks, like giving high-fives, to make them more attractive for adoption. Shelters across the country, including KC Pet Project, have been participating.

The premise is simple. A kitty who can sit on command, jump through a hoop, give a paw bump or a high five demonstrates to a prospective owner that it can listen to instructions and connect with others.

A high five can make a shy cat open up and more aggressive cats play nice, Galaxy preaches.

Another benefit: Shelters can be a scary place for animals, and activities like learning tricks are a good stress relief.

Big life changes can lead to cats losing their mojo, their confidence, their ""raw cat essence,"" Christie Rogero, program manager for Cat Pawsitive, tells Mother Nature Network.

Cats can withdraw and shut down in a shelter setting.

""When they arrive in a shelter, they may have lost the only family they’ve ever known, or they may have come from a difficult life as a stray on the street,"" Rogero said.

""We help those cats to feel more confident, to feel safe interacting with new people, to even spend more time at the front of their cages actively soliciting attention than hiding in the corner with their face to the wall.

""They get the kind of enrichment that cats need to be themselves and show their true personalities to potential adopters. This helps them to make connections and to get adopted more quickly.""

Ahead of National High Five Day on Thursday — who knew that existed? — Galaxy is having a contest, inviting animal shelters and pet owners to post online photos and videos of cats giving high fives, using the hashtag #CatPawsitive and the tags @TheJacksonGalaxyProject and @HaloPets.

Entries are rolling in.

HAVE. YOU. EVER?

""Training a cat to do tricks is not as hard as we would think,"" said Stephen Holdeman, manager of feline behavior and training at KC Pet Project. ""All we need is the right amount of patience, timing and motivation.""

He explained how he does it.

After he finds out what kind of food the cat likes, Holdeman uses a technique called ""operant conditioning,"" which associates a cat’s action with the prediction of getting a reward such as a favorite food or treat.

He also uses a clicker, a popular training device that makes a clicking noise.

""In the initial stages, we get the cat used to the idea that when it hears the sound of the clicker, one of its favorite treats appears,"" Holdeman said.

""After we have bridged these two ideas together, we can use the clicker to reinforce different actions the cat does to let them know that if they repeat it, they will get a treat.""

Then he tries to get the cat to ""target"" something with its paws, usually getting them to play with a wand or toy. He ""clicks"" the clicker when the cat touches the object with its paw.

TIMING IS IMPERATIVE

""Making sure the timing of the click is lined up with the action we want is important, so the cat doesn’t start to ignore its relevancy,"" he said.

""After several repetitions, the cat starts to link everything together, and learn that when they touch the specific object, they get a treat, and they’re happy to repeat it. Now all you need to do is let your extended hand be the target, and we’ve got a high five.""

So far, about 30 shelters across the country have worked with the Cat Pawsitive program, with another 50 expected to participate this year, according to Mother Nature Network.

More than 400 cats who participated were adopted during the first two semesters of the program, created by The Jackson Galaxy Project, a charitable program of GreaterGood.org.

It’s a free program for shelters and rescues, with sponsors including the Petco Foundation and Halo Pets picking up the tab for training materials, online classes and other things such as training treats.

And what about all those high five photos and videos?

After Thursday, Galaxy will judge them, and five finalists will receive cash and prizes for the animal shelter or rescue of their choice. Grand prize is a $5,000 cash grant and 10,000 bowls of Halo pet food.

A Kentucky tattoo shop is offering to cover up hate and gang symbols for free,A Kentucky tattoo shop is offering to cover up hate and gang symbols for free,1.0,"(CNN) A tattoo parlor in Kentucky is using ink to unite communities across the country by offering free appointments to anyone who wants to cover up their hate or gang symbol tattoos.

Tattoo artists Jeremiah Swift and Ryun King at the Gallery X Art Collective in Murray said they decided to offer this service as a way to take a stance in the Black Lives Matter movement amid the protests calling for an end to police brutality and racial injustice.

""It's definitely a long overdue change,"" King told CNN.

""Having anything hate related is completely unacceptable. A lot of people when they were younger just didn't know any better and were left with mistakes on their bodies. We just want to make sure everybody has a chance to change.""

Since posting on Facebook about the free coverups two weeks ago, the shop has already received over 30 requests which continue to pour in, according to Swift.

""One of the people we got was a man with both of his forearms completely covered in hate symbols, absolutely everywhere. How is this man going to interact with society with the mistakes he made 10, 15, 20 years ago?"" King said.

""We also got a guy with a giant swastika who said he has never taken his shirt off in front of his kids. I like seeing that. I like seeing people want to change themselves for the better. That swells me full of emotions.""

The artists said they will cover up anyone's tattoos, even if they are from out of state, and offer numerous designs they can choose from.

A new tattoo, a new life

King's first client was Jennifer Tucker, a 36-year-old mother of two who wanted to cover up a small Confederate flag she got tattooed on her ankle when she was 18 years old.

""I went to a school where there wasn't a single black person,"" Tucker told CNN. ""Our community had no black families, they would literally run them out every time one moved in. Everyone in my school flew rebel flags and had rebel flag tattoos and I bandwagoned and got the tattoo. It was a horrible thing to do.""

Jennifer Tucker.

After high school, Tucker moved to Paducah, Kentucky, where she became involved in various solidarity movements and peaceful protests aimed at uniting the community and fighting racial injustice against black people.

A friend of Tucker's sent her the tattoo shop's Facebook post offering the free coverups, and she immediately messaged the shop asking for an appointment.

""I just needed to get that symbol of hatred off of my body. Every time I attend a group meeting or protest, I make a new friend. And I don't want to be standing next to them with a confederate flag on my leg,"" Tucker said.

On Tuesday, after a 40 minute drive and nearly 20 years of ""looking down at the tattoo regretting it,"" King covered up the flag with a Pickle Rick, a character from the cartoon ""Rick and Morty.""

""It feels so amazing, it's life changing. I knew I had to do it, to be an example for other people who were in the same position. There's not a whole lot I can do, but this is something I can do to spread love, not hate.""

Because of their help, Tucker said she is finally ready to close the chapter of her old life and start looking forward to new days full of love and kindness.",https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/14/us/tattoo-shop-hate-gang-symbol-cover-up-kentucky-trnd/index.html
'Remarkable' 16-Year-Old Praised for Leading Peaceful Protests in Detroit: 'I Made a Mark','Remarkable' 16-Year-Old Praised for Leading Peaceful Protests in Detroit: 'I Made a Mark',1.0,"Stefan Perez urged the Detroit protesters to comply with the city's 8 p.m. curfew so that no one got hurt

A Detroit teenager is being commended for his actions after he helped lead peaceful protests, spurred by George Floyd's death, through the city and get people home safely at the end of the night.

Stefan Perez never expected to become a leader when he set out to protest racial injustices and police brutality over the weekend, but he quickly found himself in that role — with a megaphone in hand — as he urged protesters to go home and abide by the city's 8 p.m. curfew on Monday, The Detroit Free Press reported.

Get push notifications with news, features and more.

""I tried to keep everybody together, I tried to keep everybody as a collective group, and we marched,"" the 16-year-old told the outlet in an interview. ""I'm surprised people listened to me. I'm glad they did because they're not hurt right now, 'cause they could be.""

""The fact that I was able to put my hand up and stop everybody from causing trouble here tonight, I look back and smile at that moment,"" Perez added. ""The people followed me into battle and I'm glad that I was able to get them home safely.""

Being a leader wasn't always something that Perez considered himself, but the teen — who is preparing to enter his senior year at the Communication and Media Arts High School — said his grandmother had a major role in helping him get there.

""If it wasn't for my grandmother, I wouldn't be here today,"" he explained to the outlet, noting how he's been living with her for a year but also has a good relationship with his mother and step-father.

""As a teenager, I have put her through a lot of stuff,"" he said of his grandmother. ""But she stuck by my side when I needed it the most and she'd be proud of what we accomplished tonight.""

Just one night earlier, things became dangerous in Detroit as police fired tear gas and shot rubber bullets at protesters who refused to go home on the first night of the curfew. Those who did not comply were arrested, according to the Detroit Free Press.

Perez — who said he is not affiliated with any political group — refused to let more violence happen and knew he had to step up to ensure that it didn't.

On his knees in the middle of Michigan Avenue on Monday, the teen — who is Black, Mexican, Puerto Rican and Nicaraguan — yelled into a megaphone and urged protesters to return home, the outlet reported.

His efforts, combined with the leadership of a few other individuals, ensured that the protest was peaceful and did not include any violence or major incidents, according to the Detroit Free Press.

""We did this. I'm not going to necessarily say I did this, because I didn't,"" Perez explained. ""I had plenty of help today. But I'm here. I'm alive. I woke up today enough to do this. I'm just glad that I'm here. I'm glad I was able to take a knee, put my hand up and say 'Black Lives Matter.'""

His leadership also caught the attention of Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, who watched the protest from a live stream. The two connected on a phone call shortly afterward, and Duggan applauded the teen for keeping the peace, according to the local newspaper.

""I was watching the video and I saw your leadership and I had tears in my eyes,"" Duggan told him on the phone while he was being interviewed. ""You are everything that is special about the city of Detroit... we're gonna fight this injustice because of people like you.""

Toson Knight, who previously worked with the mayor and was volunteering at the protest with the violence prevention organization Cease Fire, connected the pair on the call, and later reiterated Duggan's remarks to the outlet while reflecting on the moment.

""Mayor Duggan called me and said he thought the kid was remarkable and said he brought tears to his eyes,"" he recalled. ""I gave him the phone and at first he didn't believe me. To have the mayor call you and you're only 16, is major. I hope that motivates him to continue being the leader that he is.""

Perez was certainly inspired, telling the Detroit Free Press after the phone call, ""That was amazing. ... I didn't think I was gonna make it to 16.""

""The fact that people follow me... and the fact that the mayor just spoke to me, the fact that the Detroit police didn't shoot. And they could've. It's just amazing,"" continued the teen, who plans on attending Wayne County Community College after graduation. ""I'm glad I'm not a statistic because I could be.""

""At the end of the day I felt like I made a mark,"" Perez added. ""I felt like people that [were] with me felt that. They felt the pain. All we wanted was just to reconcile for ourselves to the people we lost: George Floyd, Sandra Bland, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin. There are so many names ... I'm glad that I'm not a name.""

"The 22-year-old Brit who stopped the global cyberattack is donating his $10,000 reward to charity","The 22-year-old Brit who stopped the global cyberattack is donating his $10,000 reward to charity",1.0,"The WannaCry ransomware. gigi.h/Twitter

LONDON — The 22-year-old Brit who ""accidentally"" halted Friday's devastating global cyberattack says he plans to give his $10,000 (£7,700) reward to charity.

""I don't do what I do for money or fame,"" he told Business Insider. ""I'd rather give the money to people who need it.""

Late last week, a ransomware attack that used a leaked National Security Agency ""EternalBlue"" software exploit spread rapidly around the world, infecting organisations in more than 150 countries, including Britain's National Health Service, the Spanish telecommunications giant Telefonica, Nissan, and FedEx.

But the ""WannaCry"" malware 's spread was halted when a pseudonymous British security researcher who goes by MalwareTech registered a website he found when investigating the malware's code. In doing so, he inadvertently triggered a ""kill switch"" — and he continued to host the website when he realised what he had done.

Since then, he has been inundated with unwanted publicity, with journalists tracking down his real name, publishing his photo, and appearing outside his home, where he lives with his parents.

""If you turn up at my house you're crossed off the list of potential media outlets I will do an exclusive with,"" he tweeted on Monday. ""For the record I don't 'fear for my safety,' I'm just unhappy with trying to help clear up Friday's mess with the doorbell going constantly.""

He has now been offered a $10,000 reward — but he says he doesn't want it.

HackerOne is a platform that lets security professionals responsibly report potential security issues in software, often in return for a cash reward, a so-called bug bounty. In recognition of MalwareTech's efforts, the company publicly offered him the $10,000 bounty, writing, ""Thank you for your active research into this malware and for making the internet safer!""

He responded that he would donate it to charity.

""I plan on holding a vote to decided which charities will get the majority of the money,"" he wrote. ""The rest will go to buying books/resources for people looking to get into [information security] who can't afford them.""

In a message, MalwareTech told Business Insider he hadn't decided the sort of charities he would give the reward to, and that he planned ""to let people suggest which they think is best.""

So why does he do what he does? ""Because it helps people, and I enjoy it,"" he said.

The vulnerability in Microsoft Windows that WannaCry exploited was patched in March, but because many organisations hadn't updated their software, they remained vulnerable.

On Monday, Microsoft published a blog post excoriating the NSA for ""stockpiling"" software exploits and for the subsequent leak of those exploits online by the hacking group Shadow Brokers.

""An equivalent scenario with conventional weapons would be the US military having some of its Tomahawk missiles stolen,"" wrote Microsoft's president, Brad Smith. ""The governments of the world should treat this attack as a wake-up call.""

MalwareTech has since been offered another reward for his work — a year's worth of free pizza, courtesy of the food delivery firm Just Eat.

""Yeah, I'll probably claim it,"" he said. ""I do like delivered food, and it would be perfect for con after-parties.""",http://uk.businessinsider.com/malwaretech-donate-10000-wannacry-reward-charity-ransomware-2017-5
Costco lifts minimum wage above Amazon or Target to $16 per hour,Costco raises minimum wage to $16 per hour,1.0,"Slideshow ( 3 images )

(Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp is raising the minimum wage for its hourly staff to $16 from next week, a dollar more than what its competitors Amazon.com Inc and Target Corp pay per hour.

The membership-only retailer’s move comes as U.S. President Joe Biden plans to raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2025, and a week after rival Walmart Inc raised its hourly wage to an average of $15.

Costco's Chief Executive Officer Craig Jelinek made the announcement at a U.S. Senate Budget Committee hearing on worker wages at large companies. (bit.ly/3r6YwoQ)

“It takes a lot of time to interview, find employees, lot of labor involved just trying to hire individuals. We want people to stay with us,” Jelinek said, answering to Senator Bernie Sanders, who chairs the Senate Budget Committee.

Issaquah, Washington-based Costco, which has over 180,000 employees in the U.S, has seen sales boom during the COVID-19 pandemic as consumers stocked up their pantries.

The company, which raised hourly wages to $15 in 2019, also offered a premium pay to workers during the virus outbreak.

“In my past experience, wages usually don’t put people out of business, how you run your business will put you out of business,” Jelinek said at the hearing.

Even as big corporations raise their hourly wages, many small businesses have opposed a $15 federal minimum wage, saying it would lead to job cuts and closures.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-costco-wholesale-pay/costco-raises-minimum-wage-to-16-per-hour-idUSKBN2AP28X
Georgia student who posted photo of a crowded school hallway and called it 'good and necessary trouble' no longer suspended,Update: Georgia student who posted photo of a crowded school hallway no longer suspended,1.0,"(CNN) The mother of a student who was suspended after posting a photo on Twitter that showed her high school's crowded hallways this week tells CNN that her daughter's suspension has been reversed.

The viral photo showed students at North Paulding High School, outside Atlanta, crowded in hallways and with few visible masks. Hannah Watters, the sophomore who posted it, said she was initially suspended over the act.

Hannah's mother, Lynne Watters, spoke with the school's principal Friday morning by phone, she told CNN. The woman was told her daughter would not be suspended and that a suspension would not appear on her daughter's record.

Hannah will be in school on Monday, she and her mother told CNN.

As schools have opened for the new academic year around the country, parents and administrators are making difficult decisions about how to ensure students get the education they need while also staying safe in an ongoing pandemic. While many have responded to the resurgence of cases with completely remote schooling, others have opted to return to classrooms , which the nation's top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, has said works if safety measures are the priority.

Gray wolves to be reintroduced to Colorado in unprecedented vote,Gray wolves to be reintroduced to Colorado in unprecedented vote,1.0,"In Colorado, the wolves are coming home.

Voters in the state narrowly approved a ballot initiative, Proposition 114, paving the way for gray wolves to be reintroduced into Colorado, where they were hunted to extinction by the 1940s. This is the first time a state has voted to reintroduce an animal to the ecosystem.

The Colorado Parks and Wildlife department will lead the effort to establish a sustainable population of the animals in the western part of the state beginning in 2022 or 2023. The Southern Rocky Mountains contain millions of acres of suitable habitat—where wolves once thrived—land that could support several hundred wolves or more, biologists say.

Opponents of the initiative conceded they had lost on November 5, but the vote was close: As of Thursday afternoon, with 90 percent of the votes in, there were 1,495,523 votes for and 1,475,235 against. But most of the remaining uncounted votes come from urban areas that strongly support reintroduction.

“Reintroducing wolves will restore Colorado's natural balance,” says Jonathan Proctor, a conservationist with the group Defenders of Wildlife, which assisted the Rocky Mountain Wolf Action Fund in passing the measure.

Supporters say it’s especially timely, since the federal government removed Endangered Species Act protections for the animals in the contiguous U.S. in late October. (Learn more: Gray wolves taken off U.S. endangered species list in controversial move.)

The Colorado reintroduction initiative was opposed by many in rural areas, including ranchers, who worry that wolves will kill their cattle.

Many of these opponents have objected to leaving the question of reintroduction to voters, rather than state wildlife officials.

Shawn Martini, spokesperson for Coloradans for Protecting Wildlife, which opposes the initiative, says state biologists have previously declined to introduce wolves.

“This is the first time that any species would be introduced via the ballot box, and there's a reason it's never been done before—direct democracy certainly has its limits,” he says.

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

Advocates point to the successful reintroduction of wolves to the Northern Rockies in the 1990s, where only one in 10,000 cattle in wolf-occupied counties are killed by the predators on average, Proctor says. The Colorado initiative will also fund a program to reimburse ranchers for lost livestock.

Some hunters also opposed the measure for fear of losing elk to the predators, though in the Northern Rockies, records show wolves have not impacted elk harvests.

Lone wolves

Wolves once ranged over most of North America but were nearly wiped out by the early 20th century in the contiguous U.S. by widespread hunting, trapping, and poisoning, much of it government-sponsored, with only a small population hanging on in the Great Lakes region. They were placed on the Endangered Species List in the 1970s, and in 1995 and 1996 the federal government reintroduced wolves to Yellowstone National Park and Idaho. From there the animals spread to Montana, Washington State, Oregon, and northern California.

But wolves still haven’t established a permanent population in Colorado. There’s also a formidable distance of several hundred miles between the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem and the Colorado state line—and wolves that attempt to travel south can be killed in Wyoming, where it’s legal to kill them throughout 85 percent of the state without restriction.

In January, a small wolf pack was seen in northwestern Colorado, but several of their members were shot when crossing back into Wyoming. Besides that pack, a few more lone wolves have been spotted in Colorado since the 1990s, but not enough to repopulate the state.

“Almost every one we can account for has died or left,” says Joel Berger, a wildlife ecologist at Colorado State University.

Though some scientists have made the argument that it would be better for wolves to recolonize Colorado naturally, “we've waited for 25 years,” Berger says. “It’s unlikely to happen soon.”

Berger, who wasn’t directly involved in the reintroduction initiative, is excited about the prospect of “a connected population of wolves, from Canada down to Mexico” that will help the species maintain genetic diversity as they reclaim their former habitat.

Long-term, wolves have a good chance of moving beyond Colorado—for example, into New Mexico. That could lead to the introduction of new genes into the endangered and inbred population of Mexican gray wolves in Arizona and New Mexico, explains Michael Robinson, a conservation advocate with the Center for Biological Diversity, an organization also involved in passing the ballot initiative. Robinson has been pushing for wolf reintroduction in Colorado for decades.

Wolf benefits

The livestock industry, some hunting groups, and the Colorado Farm Bureau rallied against the measure, which was supported largely by voters in urban areas.

Martini stresses that the majority of rural residents in western Colorado have opposed the measure, whereas supportive urban voters won’t have to live alongside the animals, a scenario he considers unfair.

But conservationists point to the beneficial role of wolves as apex predators and keystone species. They help thin out sick animals, maintaining healthy populations of deer and elk, thus limiting overgrazing and erosion, Proctor says. By killing and competing with coyotes, wolves can support higher populations of other small carnivores, including foxes. And the remains of wolf kills also provide food for many scavengers, including endangered wolverines, eagles, and bears, Robinson says.

Proctor also emphasizes that “the experience of living with wolves in other places, like the Northern Rockies, has shown that wolves are not the threat people sometimes make them out to be.”

Reintroduction program biologists will make it a priority to work with people who live alongside wolves, for example providing training and resources for ranchers to help prevent wolves from preying on cattle in the first place, Proctor adds.

“Colorado has the chance to be better than the other states,” he says, “by being inclusive.”",https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2020/11/colorado-approves-gray-wolf-reintroduction/
"Scottish clan chief plans to rewild his Isle of Skye estate with 370,000 native trees","Scottish clan chief plans to rewild his Isle of Skye estate with 370,000 native trees, red squirrels and beavers to transform island from man-made moonscape",1.0,"A Scottish clan chief plans to rewild his ancestral estate as part of an ambitious project to transform the 'beautiful but not natural' Isle of Skye.

Hugh MacLeod, the 30th Chief of Clan MacLeod, hopes to overhaul the 'lunarscape' surrounding Dunvegan Castle by planting a total of 371,875 native trees in its land.

It is hoped these broadleaf forests will provide a home for reintroduced beaver populations and the declining numbers of red squirrels and wildcats which inhabit parts of Scotland.

The ambitious project, which has been in development on the 42,000-acre MacLeod Estate for years, has been awarded a £1million grant from the Scottish Government and the EU.

The native forest will contain different species mixtures to suit the land's terrain and ecology. The carbon offset is estimated to exceed 40,000 tons over a 65 year period.

The focus will be on planting trees which historically grew in the Isle of Skye's peat soil - such as birch, rowan and cherry trees, the Daily Telegraph reported.

Hugh MacLeod, chief of Clan MacLeod of Dunvegan, hopes to overhaul the 'lunarscape' surrounding Dunvegan Castle (pictured) by planting a total of 371,875 native trees in its land

It is hoped the rewilding strategy will encourage others to take on similar initiatives to restore Skye's 'wet desert' landscape, which is 'a legacy of centuries of depredation caused by over-grazing.'

Mr MacLeod, the Estate Director, said: 'In a difficult year of persistent bad news, I am thrilled that the MacLeod Estate has been awarded this grant for one of the largest and most ambitious native woodland creation projects on the Isle of Skye.

'I had the idea over ten years ago, when I decided to stop farming at the estate's Totachocaire Farm which is not only marginal land, but was also loss making for almost every year of its operation since it was revived by my late father in the 1970s.

'This is the first phase of our nascent rewilding plans and once the woodlands are established, this will create an extensive and biodiverse habitat to support a number of native species.'

How the Isle of Skye's 'beautiful but not natural' landscape was manmade The Isle of Skye, known for its rugged landscapes, has been described by Hugh MacLeod as a 'wet desert.' He says the Scottish land is lacking wildlife and 'beautiful but not natural,' with native greenery no longer populating the dramatic landscape. According to the clan chief, the current landscape of the Isle of Skye makes clear it was an ancient woodland before the land was stripped bare by human activity. The extensive peat bog on the island is particularly indicative of this, he said. This bog is an ombrotrophic mire, which supports plant growth. It is believed birch, rowan, cherry, willow, hawthorn and sycamore trees would have previously grown in the fertile peat soil. However, it has been suggested human activity and over-grazing by farm animals caused the land to evolve into something 'beautiful but not natural.' Advertisement

He added the current landscape of the Isle of Skye is clear evidence it was an ancient woodland before the land was stripped bare by human activity.

'After all, the extensive peatbog on the island is clear evidence of ancient and widespread woodlands,' Mr MacLeod said.

'In common with other areas of the Highlands, Skye’s current lunarscape appearance is beautiful, but it is not natural.

'This project aims to restore this piece of land and it will have a positive ripple effect on the local community beyond the obvious ecological benefits, creating more jobs in sustainable eco-tourism and more rewilding initiatives.'

Mr MacLeod has been working to turn Dunvegan Castle into a successful tourist destination after inheriting the area from his late father John more than 10 years ago.

The 9th century castle has been the ancestral home of Clan MacLeod for more than 800 years, and now has an annual turnover of £2.9million with 168,000 UK and international visitors each year.

The land includes the MacLeod Tables Cafe, four retail outlets, five holiday cottages, seal trips, amenity woodlands, Dunvegan Pier, and Glenbrittle Campsite.

The clan chief hopes the rewilding, which is being overseen by Scottish Woodlands Ltd, will improve eco-tourism and create more jobs on the Isle of Skye.

The project's first phase will focus on transforming Dunvegan's former home farm, Totachocaire, into a 593-acre native woodland.

This new landscape will be three times the size of the existing contiguous woodlands around Dunvegan Castle and Gardens.

A total of 371,875 trees will be planted in addition to the 60,000 native trees planted by the estate in 2010, to replace a monoculture coniferous plantation dating back to the post-war years.

As one of the largest native woodland projects on the Isle of Skye, this will bring the total number of native trees planted on the MacLeod Estate since 2010 to 432,000.

Mr MacLeod said the current landscape of the Isle of Skye (pictured: a peatbog) is clear evidence it was an ancient woodland before the land was stripped bare by human activity

It is also hoped the broadleaf forests will become a habitat for beavers, which were released in Scotland for the first time in 400 years in May 2009. Pictured: A European Beaver in Scotland

Knepp Wildland: Heavily farmed estate is restored by pioneering rewilding project Knepp is a 3,500-acre estate just south of Horsham, West Sussex, which was devoted to a rewilding project in 2001. The Estate was once heavily farmed despite the land - Low Weald clay over a bedrock of limestone - not being ideal for modern agriculture. In February 2000, Knepp Home Farm's owner Charlie Burrell decided to sell the Estate's dairy herds and farm machinery. Then, in 2002, Knepp was granted Countryside Stewardship funding to restore the Repton Park in the middle of the land. In December, Mr Burrell revealed his vision for rewilding Knepp in its entirety with a Letter of Intent sent to Natural England. It was eight years later, in 2010, that the Knepp Wildland Project received Higher Level Stewardship funding. The Knepp Wildland Project 'uses grazing animals as the drivers of habitat creation, and with the restoration of dynamic, natural water courses, the project has seen extraordinary increases in wildlife.' Species like turtle doves, nightingales, peregrine falcons and purple emperor butterflies are soaring in numbers at the Estate. Source: Knepp Wildland Advertisement

The planting is expected to be completed by the end of 2021.

It is also hoped the rewilded area will become a habitat for beavers, which were released in Scotland for the first time in 400 years in May 2009.

The Scottish Wildlife Trust introduced the beaver families to Knapdale Forest, which is west of Lochgilphead in the Heart of Argyll.

They have since settled on the River Tay, which flows easterly across the Highlands from the slopes of Ben Lui.

A similar rewilding initiative has recently been undertaken in Knepp, a 3,500 acre estate just south of Horsham, West Sussex.

The woodland, which was once heavily farmed, has been devoted to a 'pioneering rewilding project' since 2001.

The Knepp Wildland Project 'uses grazing animals as the drivers of habitat creation, and with the restoration of dynamic, natural water courses, the project has seen extraordinary increases in wildlife.'

Environmentalist Ben Goldsmith said: 'Politicians, communities and landowners across Britain are coming to the realisation that restoring the terribly depleted natural fabric of our landscapes offers a pathway for ecological, economic and social renewal.

'Hugh MacLeod's ground-breaking nature restoration project at the historic Dunvegan Castle on Skye is one of the most exciting rewilding stories in Britain today.'

Sarah-Jane Laing, CEO of Scottish Land & Estates, added: 'This scheme is testament to Hugh's vision, drive and ongoing commitment to an environmentally and economically sustainable future, not only for the estate but for Skye and indeed the whole of Scotland.

'SLE members such as the MacLeod Estate, continue to be at the forefront of innovative and progressive land management, making a huge contribution to Scottish prosperity and wellbeing.'

John Risby, Scottish Forestry's Highland & Islands Conservator said: 'We were pleased to be able to approve this important woodland creation scheme which will contribute to the Scottish Government's tree planting targets.

'Scottish Forestry has awarded £1million for the scheme which will be planted over the coming year, starting this winter. It was a sensitive application in terms of landscape, heritage and bird species.

'Detailed surveys were undertaken by Scottish Woodlands, the Estate's agent, and we worked with them to ensure all potential impacts were properly mitigated and the benefits of the new woodland maximised.'

John Laing, Chair of Dunvegan & District Community Council, added the new woodland will 'in time be a tremendous asset for Dunvegan and Skye.'

'It will bring pleasure and enjoyment for locals and visitors for generations to come,' he said.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-9004873/Scottish-clan-chief-plans-rewild-Isle-Skye-estate-370-000-native-trees.html

A red state is capping interest rates on payday loans: ‘This transcends political ideology’,Nebraska voters overwhelming chose to put limits on the interest rates that payday lenders can charge — making it the 17th state to limit interest rates on the risky loans.,1.0,"Nebraska voters overwhelming chose to put limits on the interest rates that payday lenders can charge — making it the 17th state to limit interest rates on the risky loans. But consumer advocates cautioned that future protections related to payday loans may need to happen at the federal level because of recent changes in regulations.

With 98% of precincts reporting, 83% of voters in Nebraska approved Initiative 428, which will cap the annual interest charged for delayed deposit services, or payday lending, at 36%. On average, payday lenders charge 400% interest on the small-dollar loans nationally, according to the Center for Responsible Lending, a consumer advocacy group that supports expanded regulation of the industry.

By approving the ballot measure, Nebraska became the 17th state in the country (plus the District of Columbia) to implement a cap on payday loans. The overwhelming vote in a state where four of its five electoral votes will go to President Donald Trump — the state divides its electoral votes by congressional district, with Nebraska’s second district voting for former Vice President Joe Biden — shows that the issue could garner bipartisan support.

“This is not a lefty, out-there, high-regulation state,” said Noel Andrés Poyo, executive Director of the National Association for Latino Community Asset Builders, a Latino-owned business advocacy group.

“The people of Nebraska are not on average very big about limiting the financial services industry,” Poyo added. “But when you ask evangelical Christians about payday lending, they object to it.”

Industry officials argued that the ballot measure would impede consumers’ access to credit, and said that the rate cap makes it such that lenders will not be able to operate in the state.

“It amounts to eliminating regulated small-dollar credit in the state while doing nothing to meet Nebraskans’ very real financial needs, including amid the COVID-19 pandemic and economic downturn,” said Ed D’Alessio, executive director of INFiN, a national trade association for the consumer financial services industry.

The ballot measure’s success in Nebraska could presage similar efforts in other states. Other states that have capped the interest payday lenders charge in recent years via ballot measures like Nebraska’s include Colorado and South Dakota.

“This transcends political ideology,” said Ashley Harrington, federal advocacy director at the Center for Responsible Lending. “There is just something wrong with triple digit interest rates and trapping people in cycles of debt.”

The experiences in those states add further support behind initiatives to cap interest on small-dollar loans. In South Dakota, the volume of unsecured and payday alternative loans offered by credit unions, which are subject to an 18% and 28% rate cap, has grown considerably since the ballot measure passed in 2016, research has shown. And polls indicate continued support of the interest rate cap on payday loans among a vast majority of South Dakotans.

Federal regulators have loosened limits on the payday lending industry

Despite the measure’s success in Nebraska, changes occurring at the federal level could weaken efforts to regulate the payday-lending industry and cap the interest rates it charges.

In July, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued a new rule rescinding provisions of a 2017 rule that mandated that payday lenders must determine whether a person will be able to repay their loans. Critics of the payday industry have long argued that the high interest rates the loans carry cause people to fall into debt spirals, whereby they must borrow new loans to pay off existing payday loans.

NALCAB, which is being represented by the Center for Responsible Lending and Public Citizen, filed a lawsuit in federal court last week against the CFPB looking to overturn the new rule.

Meanwhile, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates national banks, last month finalized the “true lender” rule. This new regulation allows non-bank lenders, such as payday lenders, to partner with banks to offer small-dollar loans. Because the loans would be made through the bank, they would not be subject to state-based interest rate caps. Critics have called the new regulation a “rent-a-bank” scheme and argue it could harm consumers.

“It’s not a loophole, it’s a gaping tunnel,” Poyo said, in criticizing the OCC’s new regulation.

If Democrat Joe Biden wins the presidential election, his administration would take over leadership of both the CFPB and the OCC and could rescind these new policies, Poyo said.

However, Harrington argued that the federal government should go a step further and create a federal cap on interest rates. Even if control of Congress remains divided between Democrats and Republicans, Harrington said lawmakers should look to the success of the ballot measures in Nebraska and South Dakota as inspiration.

“Everyone should be able to get behind safe, affordable consumer loans that don’t have triple-digit interest rates,” Harrington said.",https://www.marketwatch.com/story/a-trump-supporting-state-is-capping-interest-rates-on-payday-loans-this-transcends-political-ideology-11604533732

Ginsburg is still recuperating from surgery to remove two cancerous nodules from her lungs.

""Post-surgery evaluation indicates no evidence of remaining disease, and no further treatment is required,"" said court spokesperson Kathleen Arberg.

Ginsburg, 85, who missed oral arguments this week, has not been on the bench since her surgery last month, but she has participated by reading briefs at home.

Her absence comes as the court is considering whether to take up several controversial issues including the administration's decision to phase out the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and its ban that blocks most transgender individuals from serving in the military. The justices met behind closed doors earlier on Friday to discuss pending petitions and Ginsburg participated by proxy.

Monday marked the first time she had ever missed oral arguments due to her health. She has survived two other bouts of cancer.

Finished his senior year with a state title and a scholarship to West Point,1.0,"CHARLOTTE. N.C. — A football coach and his quarterback always have a special bond, but at Harding University High, it's a deeper, more meaningful one.

Sam Greiner started coaching the football team in 2015.

He said, right away, the athletic director told him some of his star players weren't eligible to play, including quarterback Braheam Murphy.

Murphy says he went home and cried for two straight days because he struggled with his grades and a place to live.

""Sometimes I'd stay at my friends' house,” Murphy said. “Me and my sister would have to stay at my friends' house. We'd go back and forth. Basically. I wasn't in a stable home.""

Greiner first noticed this when he dropped Murphy off at different homes.

""Eventually, he just opened up to me and he was like, ‘Uh, I have to stay with my sister from place to place,” Greiner said. “I didn't know what to do at the time.""

Greiner said that after talking to his wife, they decided to take Murphy in.

Two years later, Murphy is still living with the Greiner family.

He started getting straight As in school and found comfort in his faith.

Murphy earned a scholarship to the military academy at West Point.

The bakery operates on a one-for-one donation model, meaning that for every cupcake sold he donates one to the homeless.

The teen bakes all sorts of things, but cupcakes are his biggest seller, he told The Washington Post.

As a child, Michael Platt loved to bake.

And when he turned 11, the Bowie, Maryland, resident turned his passion into a business and founded Michael's Desserts, The Washington Post reported.

The bakery operates on a one-for-one donation model, meaning that for every cupcake sold he donates one to the homeless, according to WJLA. He makes donation batches about once a month, he told the outlet.

Platt said it is important to him that his business has a philanthropic component.

""I knew that I wanted to make a business, but I knew I didn't just want to make money, I also wanted to help people at the same time,"" he told WJLA.

Michael's Desserts partnered with No Kid Hungry, which is a nonprofit that provides meals, hosts educational programming, and advocates on behalf of children.

In the past two years, Platt's business has grown.

The teen's baked goods include cookies and cupcakes, according to The Washington Post. He told the newspaper that each month he sells about 12 cookies, 75 cupcakes, and 12 rotating ""chef's choice"" items, which he also calls ""freedom fighter cupcakes.""

Every month the teen draws inspiration from a different historical figure and bases the ""chef's choice"" flavor on that person. Past honorees have included Harriet Tubman and Martin Luther King Jr., who inspired the business, according to The Washington Post.

Cupcakes, in general, are by far his biggest seller — and a four-pack sells for $15, according to the newspaper. Platt, who is homeschooled, has gotten help and support from his mom, who he calls his ""baking consultant.""

He's grateful for all the support — and for all the orders people have put in. Most of which are placed by strangers.

Trump signs measure to preserve Native languages,Trump signs measure to preserve Native languages,1.0,"U.S. President Donald Trump signed a measure that extends federal grant programs aimed at preserving Indigenous languages and expands eligibility so more tribes can participate.

The president's signature came Friday, after the measure cleared the U.S. House with bipartisan support. Senate approval came earlier this year.

The legislation was named after Esther Martinez, a traditional storyteller and Tewa language advocate from New Mexico's Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo. She died in 2006.

Her family, tribal leaders and members of New Mexico's congressional delegation say re-authorization of the programs through 2024 marks a commitment by the federal government to keep Alaska Native and American Indigenous languages alive.

Dozens of tribes and other groups from Alaska to Hawaii, Arizona, New Mexico, Montana and Massachusetts have benefited from the programs over the years. Currently, there are over 40 active grants totalling more than $11 million U.S., that are being used for language preservation and immersion efforts.

Martinez's own Pueblo was awarded a grant earlier this year after seeing a decline in fluent Tewa speakers and the increase of English as the primary language in the homes of tribal members.

Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA, via Shutterstock Tribune Publishing said on Monday that it had ended talks to sell itself to Newslight, a company set up last month by the Maryland hotel executive Stewart W. Bainum Jr. and the Swiss billionaire Hansjörg Wyss, after Mr. Wyss withdrew from a planned offer on Friday. Tribune Publishing’s special committee, which evaluates bids, said in a news release on Monday that the Newslight plan could no longer “reasonably be expected to lead to a ‘superior proposal’” than the binding agreement the company had reached in February with Alden Global Capital, a New York hedge fund. (An earlier version of this item misstated that the agreement was nonbinding.) Mr. Bainum and Mr. Wyss had swooped in last month with a proposal of $18.50 per Tribune share, beating out the bid from Alden, which was for $17.25 a share. The pathway to a deal involving Mr. Bainum, the chief executive of Choice Hotels, one of the world’s largest hotel chains, is not completely blocked. In a letter on Saturday, Mr. Bainum informed the Tribune board of Mr. Wyss’s exit from a potential deal, adding that he remained committed to a proposal at $18.50 a share, after examining the company’s finances and discussing a possible agreement with other potential backers. “I remain confident that there is significant interest in joining this effort and expect the necessary arrangements among one or more additional equity financing sources can be completed expeditiously,” Mr. Bainum wrote in the letter. He declined to comment for this article. Tribune’s special committee said in its statement on Monday that it would “carefully consider any further developments in order to determine the course of action that is in the best interest of Tribune and its stockholders, subject to the terms of the Alden merger agreement.” The committee added that, in keeping with a previous recommendation, its board would advise company stockholders to vote in favor of the Alden deal. Tribune, the publisher of The Chicago Tribune, The Baltimore Sun, The Daily News and other metropolitan newspapers across the country, has been the target of Alden, its largest shareholder, since last year. Because Alden is known for slashing costs at the roughly 60 daily newspapers it controls through its MediaNews Group subsidiary, journalists at Tribune publications cheered the surprise entry of Mr. Bainum and Mr. Wyss into the bidding. Alden has said it allows newspapers that might otherwise fold in a struggling industry to remain in business. Tribune shareholders are expected to vote on a buyer this summer, after the board formally approves an offer. Correction : April 20, 2021 An earlier version of this article misstated the nature of the agreement made between Tribune and Alden Global Capital. It was binding, not nonbinding.

Apple says Parler can return to iPhones after the app makes some changes. Credit... Cristobal Herrera-Ulashkevich/EPA, via Shutterstock Parler, the social network popular with conservatives, is making its comeback. The app had been kicked off iPhones, Android devices and even the internet in January after tech companies said Parler had not effectively policed content on the network around the time of the Capitol insurrection on Jan. 6. But on Monday, Apple said in a letter to two federal lawmakers that it had approved Parler’s return to iPhones because the app had agreed to more aggressively patrol what its users posted, according to a copy of the letter obtained by The New York Times. An Apple lobbyist said in the letter that the iPhone maker had removed Parler from the App Store in January because it wasn’t taking down “posts that encouraged violence, denigrated various ethnic groups, races and religions, glorified Nazism, and called for violence against specific people.” Since then, Apple employees have “engaged in substantial conversations with Parler in an effort to bring the Parler app into compliance.” Last week, Apple told Parler that it was welcome back because of changes it had agreed to make to the app, the lobbyist said in the letter. Parler would return to the App Store when it submitted its new app, he said. Parler did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday. Parler’s return to iPhones follows the revival of its website after it went offline for about a month. Amazon had pulled support for Parler’s social network in January, forcing its website to go dark. Parler came back online in February with the help of a small web-hosting company near Los Angeles called SkySilk. Since then, some users have returned to Parler, but it appears there is less overall activity on the social network since the time of the election. Most of the conversation around Parler revolved around politics, and the user base was overwhelmingly supportive of former President Donald J. Trump. Executives at Parler, including its co-owner Rebekah Mercer, the conservative donor, hope the iPhone app can help the social network regain steam.

Exxon Mobil makes a pitch for capturing emissions and a carbon price. Exxon wants to capture carbon from industrial plants along the Houston Ship Channel and pipe it offshore. Credit... Bronte Wittpenn for The New York Times HOUSTON — Under growing pressure from investors to address climate change, Exxon Mobil on Monday proposed a $100 billion project to capture the carbon emissions of big industrial plants in the Houston area and bury them deep beneath the Gulf of Mexico. Exxon, the largest U.S. oil company, wants to create a profit-making business out of the capture of carbon emitted by petrochemical plants and other industries. But its plan would require significant government support and intervention, including the introduction of a price or tax on carbon dioxide emissions, an idea that has failed to attract enough support in Congress in the past. The company already captures carbon, which it injects into older fields to produce more oil. Exxon now wants to use its expertise to store the carbon dioxide generated by other industries. But without a price on emitting carbon, many businesses would have little financial incentive to pay Exxon to capture and store their carbon. The Obama administration failed to enact a cap-and-trade system, which raises costs for polluting companies by forcing them to buy tradable permits to release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. California, the European Union and 11 states in the Northeast use versions of cap-and-trade. Other governments, including British Columbia and Britain, have imposed a per-ton tax on emissions. Exxon wants to capture carbon from industrial plants along the Houston Ship Channel and pipe it offshore where it would stored up to 6,000 feet below the Gulf of Mexico. The effort would be paid for by industry and the government, and would eventually store 100 million tons of carbon annually — equivalent to the emissions of 20 million cars, according to Exxon. The company has discussed its idea with national and Texas policymakers and Republicans and Democrats in Congress, Exxon’s chief executive, Darren Woods, said in an interview. “They see the opportunity and appeal of this idea,” he said. “The question is, how do you translate the concept into practice?” Exxon said its proposal complements President Biden’s climate efforts, but it would require the administration to embrace a price on carbon, something it has not done. “The concept of a price on carbon is critical,” Mr. Woods said. “There has to be a way to incentivize the investment.” Offshore storage has already gained traction in Europe, where governments have put carbon prices in place and lawmakers are more willing to spend taxpayer money to address climate change. Mr. Woods said that, given the right policies, carbon capture projects could be a major business for Exxon around the world. “The potential for these markets is very, very large to the extent that demand continues to increase to decarbonize society,” he said.

United Airlines lost $1.4 billion in the first quarter but says ticket sales are bouncing back. United Airlines expects to turn a profit sometime this year, the company said on Monday. Credit... Daniel Slim/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images United Airlines said Monday that it lost nearly $1.4 billion in the first three months of the year, but added that a turnaround was close as bookings picked up. The airline said it had stopped spending more money than it collected in March from operations, investing and financing activities — losses known as its “cash burn.” United also said it expected to turn a profit sometime this year despite the weakness in corporate and international travel, which has recovered to only about 35 percent of 2019 levels. “We’ve shifted our focus to the next milestone on the horizon and now see a clear path to profitability,” Scott Kirby, United’s chief executive, said in a statement. “We’re encouraged by the strong evidence of pent-up demand for air travel and our continued ability to nimbly match it.” The airline expects to offer about 45 percent fewer seats from April through June than it did over the same period in 2019, but the company expects revenue to be down only about 20 percent on a per-seat and per-mile basis. After a merciless year, passengers started returning in greater, sustained numbers in early March. On Sunday, nearly 1.6 million people were screened at airport security checkpoints, according to Transportation Security Administration data. Over the past week, about two-thirds as many people were screened as there were in the same period in 2019. In response, airlines are adding new routes and bringing back old ones ahead of what they hope will be a busy summer. United recently added more than two dozen flights starting Memorial Day weekend, connecting cities in the Midwest to tourist destinations such as Charleston, Hilton Head and Myrtle Beach in South Carolina. On Monday, the airline said it planned to add summer flights between the East Coast and Croatia, Greece and Iceland. United also announced this month that it was hiring pilots again. Delta Air Lines reported a $1.2 billion quarterly loss last week, but said it was optimistic about the rest of the year. Its chief executive, Ed Bastian, said the airline could be profitable this summer. American Airlines and Southwest Airlines are expected to announce their first-quarter financial results on Thursday.

American Airlines’ chief explains his opposition to restrictive voting laws. “I think there was virtually no chance we could stay out of it,” Doug Parker, the head of American Airlines, said to employees. “You have to take a stand on these things.” Credit... Oliver Contreras for The New York Times The American Airlines chief executive, Doug Parker, spoke to workers last week about his decision to publicly oppose restrictive voting legislation pending in Texas, saying that people of color feel “as though these laws are making it much harder for people like them to vote.” Mr. Parker said in a meeting with employees that he wasn’t trying to take sides in a partisan dispute, but that for him, voting rights was “an equity issue,” according to a recording of the conversation obtained by View From the Wing, a travel industry blog. American Airlines declined to comment on the recording. The airline, which is based in Fort Worth, was among the first major companies to publicly oppose the voting legislation that Republicans were advancing in Texas. Just days after Georgia passed a voting law that would make it harder for some people to vote, the company came out against similar legislation pending in Texas, saying it was “strongly opposed to this bill and others like it.” In the meeting with employees last week, Mr. Parker said he felt the company was going to have to weigh in on the issue. “I think there was virtually no chance we could stay out of it,” he said. “You have to take a stand on these things.” He added that legislation that targets minority populations is bad for the economy, noting that when such laws pass, companies, sports leagues and entertainers sometimes take their business elsewhere. “The more we divide ourselves, and the more divisive we become, the less likely it is that people are going to travel to states that take divisive stances, and that’s not good for us either,” Mr. Parker said. Mr. Parker’s comments come as companies around the country are calibrating their opposition to restrictive voting laws being advanced by Republicans in almost every state. Hundreds of companies last week signed a letter opposing “discriminatory legislation.” Yet there is so far scant evidence that Republican lawmakers are reining in their efforts as a result of the corporate community’s outcry.

A former Obama administration official is tapped to lead a Treasury climate hub. Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen said combating climate change would be a top priority for her department. Credit... Al Drago for The New York Times The Treasury Department is forming a new climate “hub” and has tapped a former Obama administration official to lead the agency’s effort to fuse climate and economic policy across President Biden’s agenda. The move comes as the Biden administration is preparing to take new steps to address the financial risks associated with climate change. It is taking a series of executive actions that would affect mortgages, retirement funds, insurance companies and companies that do business with the federal government. Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen said on Monday that she had hired John E. Morton to lead Treasury’s new climate office and to advise her on climate matters. Mr. Morton was senior director for energy and climate change on the National Security Council in the Obama administration and held senior roles at the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. He has been a partner most recently at the climate change advisory and investment firm Pollination. In an interview with Yahoo Finance in January, Mr. Morton said that the response to climate change should be viewed as an economic opportunity and also made the case for some of the new financial risk disclosure requirements that Ms. Yellen and regulators were considering. “The issue of climate risk disclosure within financial institutions is going to move from what is now a relatively voluntary haphazard set of coalitions to a more mandatory requirement in the years ahead,” Mr. Morton said. “And that from my perspective as a consumer is really good.” Mr. Morton’s appointment was met with disappointment from some progressive groups. Public Citizen and Americans for Financial Reform, two left-leaning advocacy organizations, expressed concern that he lacked regulatory experience and suggested he might be too accommodating of big business. “Mr. Morton should seek input and guidance on robust regulatory action from those groups most affected by the climate crisis and their allies, not Wall Street firms seeking to profit from the transition or to avoid addressing the roots of the problem,” they wrote in a joint statement on Monday. Ms. Yellen said on Monday that the consequences of climate change were “steep” and that addressing it would be a top priority for Treasury. “Climate change requires economywide investments by industry and government as well as actions to measure and mitigate climate-related risks to households, businesses and our financial sector,” Ms. Yellen said in a statement. “Finance and financial incentives will play a crucial role in addressing the climate crisis at home and abroad and in providing capital for opportunities to transform the economy.” The Treasury Department is currently focused on climate-related financial risks and how to use the corporate tax system to combat climate change.

Big money is backing a breakaway league of top European soccer clubs. An English Premier League match in January between Arsenal and Newcastle. Arsenal is among the founding members of the new Super League. Credit... Pool photo by Adam Davy A dozen of Europe’s top soccer clubs announced plans to create a new league that would rival the longstanding Champions League, The New York Times’s Tariq Panja reports. The plan would concentrate the sport’s wealth with just a handful of teams — if it survives potential legal challenges. The Super League, as it is known, was hatched in secrecy over several months. Among the founding clubs are Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United of England; Real Madrid and Barcelona of Spain; and AC Milan and Juventus of Italy. More teams are expected to round out the league’s 15 slots for founding, permanent members. The idea is for the league to hold exclusive midweek matches in between domestic league matches. The largely closed league would operate more like the N.F.L. or the N.B.A., doing away with a new set of teams appearing in the tournament each year, based on their domestic league performance. Five spots in the 20-team league would be filled by an annual qualifying mechanism. Big money is at stake: The Super League’s founding clubs would split 3.5 billion euros, or more than $4 billion, as part of its formation. That implies that they would make far more than what the Champions League winner took home last year. JPMorgan Chase, which has lent money in the past to several of the clubs, is leading financing to support the league’s formation, starting with an initial $4 billion in debt, according to a person briefed on the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity. That debt would be paid back over 23 years and carry an interest rate of 2 percent to 3 percent. The share prices of publicly traded clubs, like Juventus and Manchester United, jumped more than 10 percent in early trading. The news spurred an outcry from the establishment. The organizer of the Champions League, UEFA, criticized the proposal as a “cynical project” and has been exploring ways to block it. The governing body of European soccer also noted that FIFA, the global soccer governing body, has threatened to expel players who participate in unsanctioned leagues from tournaments like the World Cup. Political leaders like Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain and President Emmanuel Macron of France are also opposed to the Super League. But the organization behind the Super League said on Monday that it had taken legal action to counter any efforts to block the project’s formation — though it also said it wanted to work with existing soccer organizations.

Britain is ramping up its post-Brexit plans to fortify its financial sector. The British government said it would seek to make changes that would would encourage tech companies to go public in London instead of New York. Credit... Toby Melville/Reuters The British government and Bank of England will look into creating a central bank digital currency, the two institutions announced on Monday, the latest in a string of initiatives the government is taking to try to ensure Britain holds on to its position as a leading destination for financial services. A task force will explore the uses and risks of a digital currency, the Bank of England and Treasury said. They haven’t made a decision on whether to introduce one. But the move will let Britain catch up with other central banks. The Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank have already started researching a digital dollar and a digital euro. Rishi Sunak, Britain’s top finance official, also said on Monday that the Treasury would make changes to the financial technology industry and public listings process based on the recommendations of two recent reviews. The changes are intended to make it more appealing for tech companies to go public in London instead of New York, and let founders retain more control of their companies when they do. There will be more regulatory help for growing fintech companies and those experimenting with distributed ledger technology like blockchain. Since Britain left the European Union on Dec. 31, some trading in shares and derivatives has moved from London to other financial centers, and the financial industry is wondering what will go next. The government has sought to reestablish the City of London’s reputation as a financial hub. Sweeping reviews and consultations have been introduced in a range of areas, from capital markets to making finance more green. A report by New Financial, a London-based research firm, found that more than 440 companies had moved or are planning to move staff, assets or other business out of London because of Brexit. “While this is higher than previous estimates, it underestimates the real picture,” the report published on Friday said. Bank assets worth more than 900 billion pounds, or $1.3 trillion, about 10 percent of the total assets in Britain’s banking system, have been moved or are being moved, the report said. Its authors, Eivind Friis Hamre and William Wright, wrote that these numbers might be smaller than the reality because their analysis might have missed banks and assets managers already based in the European Union. And fewer European firms than previously expected will open an office in Britain. “Over time we expect there to be a drip-feed of business and activity from the U.K. to the E.U.,” the report said. It recommended that the city consider the Brexit losses as unrecoverable, and set its sights on opportunities further afield.

Here’s what happened in markets today. Stocks on Wall Street dropped from record highs on Monday, the start of a week in which hundreds of public companies including Coca-Cola, Netflix and United Airlines will report earnings.

The S&P 500 fell half a percent, retracing part of last week’s gain that had lifted it to a new high. The Nasdaq composite dropped 1 percent.

Tesla fell more than 3 percent, a day after authorities in Texas said a Tesla car without anyone behind the wheel was involved in an crash that left two men dead. The police investigating the accident said they “believe no one was driving the vehicle at the time of the crash.”

Peloton shares dropped more than 7 percent after the Consumer Product Safety Commission issued an “urgent warning” about the exercise equipment company’s treadmill. The agency said users with small children at home should stop using the machine after reports of injuries and one fatality.

GameStop rose more than 6 percent as the video game retailer announced that its chief executive would be stepping down by the end of July. The company, which was at the center of a retail trading frenzy earlier this year, has been shaken up by the incoming chairman, Ryan Cohen, who is an activist investor in the company pushing for a digital turnaround.

Amazon is accused of corrupting the union voting process at an Alabama warehouse. The Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Ala., where Amazon employees recently voted on unionization. Credit... Bob Miller for The New York Times The union that was soundly defeated in its efforts to organize an Amazon warehouse in Alabama is seeking to overturn the results of the election, accusing the company of corrupting the voting process by intimidating and surveilling workers. On Monday, the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union filed objections to the election with the National Labor Relations Board, which oversaw the voting-by-mail process last month. The union lost its bid to organize the warehouse by a more than 2-to-1 ratio. Many workers said that the union had failed to persuade them of the benefits of organizing and that they were largely satisfied with the pay, benefits and working conditions at Amazon. In a statement on Monday, Amazon said: “Rather than accepting these employees’ choice, the union seems determined to continue misrepresenting the facts in order to drive its own agenda. We look forward to the next steps in the legal process.” At the heart of the union’s complaint is a mailbox that Amazon installed in the warehouse parking lot where workers could drop off their ballots. The union said Amazon had brought in the collection box without approval from the labor board. The company also used video cameras that could monitor the workers who dropped off their ballots there and encouraged them to drop the ballots in the box rather than mail them from home, the union said. The union said these actions by Amazon had “created the impression that the collection box was a polling location and that the employer had control over the conduct of the mail ballot election.” The union also accused Amazon of other tactics that may have intimidated workers, such as hiring local police to patrol the parking lot area while organizers were outside and pulling possibly pro-union workers out of “captive audience” meetings that the company held to address the organizing drive among the staff. The company “would request the employee to come forward, have them identified and then removed from the meeting in the presence of hundreds of other employees, thereby interfering with and/or chilling the right of employees to freely discuss issues related to the union organizing campaign,’’ the union said in its filing with the labor board. The union has asked the labor board to hold a hearing on its petition to set aside the results. If the union is successful with its legal challenges, the labor board could order that another election be held.

A coal miners union indicates it will accept a switch to renewable energy in exchange for jobs. A coal mine in Gillette, Wyo. Credit... Mead Gruver/Associated Press The country’s largest mine workers union signaled on Monday that it would accept a transition away from fossil fuels in exchange for new jobs in renewable energy, spending on technology to make coal cleaner and financial aid for miners who lose their jobs. “There needs to be a tremendous investment here,” Cecil E. Roberts, the president of the United Mine Workers of America, said in an interview. “We always end up dealing with climate change, closing down coal mines. We never get to the second piece of it.” The mine workers’ plan, which Mr. Roberts is presenting at an event with Senator Joe Manchin, Democrat of West Virginia, calls for the creation of new jobs in Appalachia through tax credits that would subsidize the making of solar panel and wind turbine components, and by funding the reclamation of abandoned mines that pose a risk to public health. The mine workers are also calling for spending on research on carbon capture and storage technology, which would allow coal-fired plants to store carbon dioxide underground rather than release it into the atmosphere, and for policies that allow coal plants to remain open if they commit to installing the technology. The union wants the federal government to support miners who lose their jobs through retraining and by replacing their wages, health insurance and pensions. Many of these proposals appear in President Biden’s $2.3 trillion jobs and infrastructure plan, including funding for research into carbon capture, which critics deride as prohibitively expensive, and money for reclaiming mines. “Change is coming, whether we seek it or not,” stated a document that the mine workers union released on Monday, titled “Preserving Coal Country.” It notes that employment in the coal industry had dropped to about 44,000 as of last December, down from 92,000 at the end of 2011. Mr. Roberts said the union would resist any climate legislation that did not help ensure a livelihood for its members. “We’re on the side of job creation, of a future for our people,” he said. “If that isn’t part of the conversation at the end of the day, we’ll be hard pressed to be supportive.”

Journalists at Insider join a union wave. Journalists at Insider, the news site formerly called Business Insider, said on Monday that they had formed a union, joining a wave that has swept digital media companies. A majority of more than 300 editorial workers, a group that includes reporters, editors and video journalists, signed cards in support, union representatives said. Insider, which changed its name this year, was co-founded by Henry Blodget in 2007 as a business-focused publication with an emphasis on the tech industry. In recent years, it has expanded its areas of coverage. Axel Springer, a digital publishing company based in Berlin, paid $343 million for a 97 percent stake in the company in 2015 and bought the remaining 3 percent in 2018. Mr. Blodget stayed on as chief executive. Insider, which has grown during the pandemic, bumped up the minimum annual salary for staff members to $60,000 in February. The Insider Union is asking the company for voluntary recognition. It is represented by the NewsGuild of New York, which also represents editorial employees at The New York Times and other publications. “I’ve seen how we’ve moved from the start-up energy of a young company into a much larger, much more formal corporation,” said Kim Renfro, an entertainment correspondent who has worked at Insider since 2014. “I see the union as being a natural part of that progress.” William Antonelli, an editor at Insider, said the union would focus on diversity and inclusion, pay equity, and more transparency on how company executives rate employees. Nicholas Carlson, Insider’s global editor in chief, said in a statement: “The satisfaction, job security and happiness of our journalists is extremely important to us. We will fully respect whatever decision our newsroom ultimately makes.” The formation of a union at Insider followed organizing efforts at BuzzFeed News, Vice, The New Yorker and Vox Media. Last week, a group of more than 650 tech workers at The Times formed a union.

Few corporate PACs donated to Republicans who challenged the election, filings show. The House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, recorded only two PAC donations in the first quarter, down from more than 100 from business groups in the same period in 2017. Credit... Jacquelyn Martin/Associated Press After the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol, scores of companies vowed to pause their political donations. Some stopped giving to all politicians, while others shunned only those 147 Republicans who had voted to overturn the presidential election results. A recent deadline for candidates to release fund-raising details for the first quarter revealed more details about how corporate giving has changed. Companies largely kept their word, the DealBook newsletter reports. Only a handful of corporate political action committees gave to the Republican objectors in the first three months of the year. The House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, recorded two PAC donations, from the California Beet Growers Association and the National Federation of Independent Business. Mr. McCarthy had more than 100 donations from business groups in the same period in 2017. Some companies took the view that not all of the 147 lawmakers are the same, a stance adopted by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Toyota gave to more than a dozen of the Republicans who voted against certifying the election results. A company spokesman said in a statement that Toyota “does not believe it is appropriate to judge members of Congress solely based on their votes on the electoral certification.” The company decided against giving to unspecified others, who, “through their statements and actions, undermine the legitimacy of our elections and institutions.” After the Capitol riot, the company said it would assess its “future PAC criteria,” a more vague pledge than those of many other companies. Cigna gave to Byron Donalds of Florida, Tom Rice of South Carolina and other House members after it said in January that it would “discontinue support of any elected official who encouraged or supported violence, or otherwise hindered the peaceful transition of power.” A spokeswoman for the insurer said that congressional votes were, “by definition, part of the peaceful transition of power,” and that its cutoff of donations “applies to those who incited violence or actively sought to obstruct the peaceful transition of power through words and other efforts.” Lawmakers at the forefront of the push to overturn the election raked in cash from other sources. Senators Josh Hawley of Missouri and Ted Cruz of Texas each brought in more than $3 million for the quarter, tapping into the outrage of their individual supporters. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia similarly raised $3.2 million, more than nearly every member of House leadership. The financial haul for those with the loudest and most extreme voices, against the backdrop of the corporate pullback, highlights a potential shift in the Republican Party’s longtime coziness with corporate America. It also raises questions about the ability of big business to influence policy, as pressure builds on companies to weigh in on hot-button issues like restrictions on voting. Lauren Hirsch and

ABN Amro’s money-laundering settlement prompts Danske Bank’s chief to resign. ABN Amro’s head office, center, in Amsterdam. An inquiry by Dutch authorities found the bank ignored signs that some clients were criminals using it as a conduit for dirty money. Credit... Peter Dejong/Associated Press The Dutch bank ABN Amro said Monday that it would pay a $580 million fine to settle money-laundering charges, prompting a former ABN manager to resign from his new job as chief executive of Danske Bank after acknowledging he was a target in a related criminal investigation. The resignation of Chris Vogelzang is an embarrassment for Danske Bank, Denmark’s largest bank, which hired him in 2019 to rebuild trust after a money-laundering scandal there. Before becoming chief executive of Danske, Mr. Vogelzang was a member of the management board of ABN Amro responsible for retail and private banking services. Mr. Vogelzang acknowledged that Dutch authorities considered him a suspect in the investigation that led ABN Amro to agree to pay 480 million euros to settle money-laundering charges. In numerous cases, according to a report by Dutch authorities, ABN Amro ignored warning signs that some clients were criminals using it as a conduit for dirty money. Mr. Vogelzang said in a statement that he was “surprised” to learn that Dutch authorities considered him a suspect. During his time at ABN Amro, he said, “I managed my management responsibilities with integrity and dedication.” Noting that Danske Bank remains under “intense scrutiny” because of money laundering at its former unit in Estonia, Mr. Vogelzang said he did “not want speculations about my person to get in the way of the continued development of Danske Bank.” Danske named Carsten Egeriis, previously the bank’s chief risk officer, to succeed Mr. Vogelzang. Gerrit Zalm, a member of Danske’s board who was chief executive of ABN Amro from 2009 to 2017, will also resign, the bank said. It did not give a reason. Danske Bank admitted in 2018 that its headquarters and its Estonian branch, which it has since closed, failed for years to prevent suspected money laundering involving thousands of customers. In the ABN Amro case, Dutch authorities found that the bank had failed to act on obvious signs of illicit activity, including large cash transactions. In several cases, authorities said, the bank continued to serve clients whose criminal activities had been reported by the media, or who had a known history of fraud. “As a bank we do not merely have a legal but also a moral duty to do our utmost to protect the financial system against abuse by criminals,” Robert Swaak, the ABN Amro chief executive, said in a statement. “Regretfully, I have to acknowledge that in the past we have been insufficiently successful in properly fulfilling our important role as gatekeeper.”

Company earnings are rebounding, but anything short of perfect could be trouble. First-quarter earnings season picks up steam this week, with analysts expecting that profits for S&P 500 companies rose roughly 27 percent in the three months through March, compared with a year earlier, when the pandemic sent corporate earnings into a tailspin. Companies such as Netflix, AT&T and American Express are all slated to issue results this week, offering a relatively well-rounded look at the state of corporate America in the early days of what could be a powerful year for the U.S. economy. It might also help set expectations for the stock market, after a big rally already this year. The consensus among 76 economists polled by Bloomberg is that gross domestic product will expand 6.2 percent in 2021, which would make it the best year for economic growth since 1984. And sentiment among analysts covering the stock market is almost universally bullish, given that strong economic tailwind. “You’d almost have to be self-deceiving to expect U.S. companies over all to underperform consensus, given how the macro backdrop is driving revenues so well,” wrote John Vail, chief global strategist at Nikko Asset Management. The expectations for profit growth are even more elevated for the current quarter: Analysts expect that in the three months that end in June, companies in the S&P 500 will notch a 54-percent rise in profits, compared with a year ago. That increase, of course, reflects a rebound from the worst of the pandemic-bred downturn. But it also is a result of “economic re-acceleration, and a rebound in commodity prices,” said Jonathan Golub, a stock market analyst at Credit Suisse. Of course, if everyone is expecting such a surge in profits, the good news could already be fully incorporated into stock prices — and that means anything short of perfect results would make for a difficult stretch for stocks. That has certainly been the case with some of the banks that reported earnings last week. Shares of Morgan Stanley, for example, dropped on Friday even though the bank reported record revenue and profit. On Monday, investors greeted better-than-expected results from warehouse company Prologis the same way. The S&P 500 is already up nearly 11 percent in 2021, and climbed to yet another record high on Friday. That could mean the market is due for a pullback anyway. The index is relatively expensive by metrics such as the price-to-earnings ratio, which compares stock prices as a share of expected corporate profits over the next 12 months. The S&P 500 is trading at nearly 23 times expected earnings. That’s roughly the valuation the index has held for most of the past year, but it’s very high by historical standards. Over the last 20 years, the S&P 500 has traded at an average of 16 times expected earnings. By comparison, a valuation of 23 times expected earnings is closer to where stock market valuations stood at the tail end of the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s. When that ended, the S&P 500 fell roughly 50 percent before it hit bottom.



The National Association of Realtors is advocating an end to a pandemic-era ban on evictions. Credit... Robert Neubecker Members of the National Association of Realtors — the nation’s largest industry group, numbering 1.4 million real estate professionals — are challenging a moratorium on evictions put in place by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Both the Alabama and the Georgia Associations of Realtors sued the federal government over the matter, and the national association is paying for all of the legal costs. A hearing is scheduled for April 29, Ron Lieber reports for The New York Times. The N.A.R. spends more money on federal lobbying than any other entity, according to the Center for Responsive for Politics. To puzzle out its actions and advocacy, let’s first be crystal clear about what the N.A.R. is and whose interests it serves. As its own chief executive boasted to members in 2017, it’s really the National Association for Realtors, not of them. And of those million-plus members, according to the association, about 38 percent own at least one rental property. The N.A.R. isn’t shy about this, stating on the lobbying section of its website that it wants to “protect property interests.” Why would it do this? The N.A.R. expert on the topic was unable to schedule a phone call, according to a spokesman. But if you’re selecting a listing agent for your house from among their members, ask that person about this issue if you’re curious or concerned. Many of them have no idea what the N.A.R. is advocating on their behalf.

The cryptocurrency industry is going to Washington. Credit... Illustration by The New York Times; Photo by Alexander Drago/Reuters Here come the lobbyists.



The cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, the asset manager Fidelity, the payments company Square and the investment firm Paradigm have established a new trade group in Washington: The Crypto Council for Innovation. The group hopes to influence policies that will be critical for expanding the use of cryptocurrencies in conjunction with traditional finance, Ephrat Livni reports in the DealBook newsletter. Cryptocurrencies are still mostly held as speculative assets, but some experts believe Bitcoin and related blockchain technologies will become fundamental parts of the financial system, and the success of businesses built around the technology may also invite more attention from regulators. “We’re going to increasingly be having scrutiny about what we’re doing,” Brian Armstrong, Coinbase’s chief executive, said on CNBC. “We’re very excited and happy to play by the rules,” he added, but regulation of crypto should be on a “level playing field with traditional financial services.” Here are four of the issues that will keep crypto lobbyists busy: The Crypto Council’s first commissioned publication is an analysis of Bitcoin’s illicit use, and it concludes that concerns are “significantly overstated” and that blockchain technology could be better used by law enforcement to stop crime and collect intelligence.

New anti-money-laundering rules passed this year will significantly expand disclosures for digital currencies. The Treasury Department has also proposed rules that would require detailed reporting for transactions over $3,000 involving “unhosted wallets,” or digital wallets that are not associated with a third-party financial institution, and require institutions handling cryptocurrencies to process more data.

When is a digital asset a security and when is it a commodity? Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that are released via a decentralized network generally qualify as commodities and are less heavily regulated than securities, which represent a stake in a venture. Tokens released by people and companies are more likely to be characterized as securities because they more often represent a stake in the issuer’s project.

The Chinese government is already experimenting with a central bank digital currency, a digital yuan. China would be the first country to create a virtual currency, but many are considering it. Some crypto advocates worry that China’s alacrity in the space threatens the dollar, national security and American competitiveness.

Flames continue to savage the Amazon and the Brazilian army could be deployed to help extinguish the vicious fires. More than 74,000 wildfires have been reported in the Amazon this year alone - and almost 10,000 of those just in the past week. French President Emmanuel Macron urged the G7 to pressure Brasil's president to take more action against the fires on Friday. The Brazilian army is ready to defend the Amazon rainforest, Edson Leal Pujol, head of the armed forces, has said amid increasing international pressure and calls for tough action to combat fires sweeping through the forest.

The Amazon rainforest is known as the “lungs of the world” and provides 20 per cent of all the world's oxygen.

The huge stretch of forest is currently experiencing the most intense blazes for almost a decade.

The sheer number of fires is the highest number since 2013 and compares with less than 40,000 in the same period in 2018.

But as the fires rage on, the rain has started to fall across some parts of the rainforest - with concerned citizens aros the globe pinning their hopes on rainfall helping to quell the spread of the blazing infernos.",https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1169284/amazon-rainforest-fire-weather-is-it-raining-amazon-rainforest-brazil-rain-radar&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiBuPG_jpnkAhXCna0KHTDCDi8QFjAEegQICRAB&usg=AOvVaw26Y9lc1DFLhfxZU5PybQOK
More than 50 cats adopted in 24 hours after city put out urgent call,More than 50 cats adopted in 24 hours after city put out urgent call,1.0,"More than 50 cats were adopted in the past 24 hours from the City of Calgary's animal shelter, after the city put out an urgent call warning the shelter was getting overcrowded.

On Wednesday, the city said spring kitten season combined with a high number of stray cats put the shelter over capacity, with more than 100 cats being housed with more arriving every day.

""Animal services has had to re-arrange rooms and cages in the shelter to accommodate all of these cats,"" Patti Smadis with the city's animal services said at the time.

The city dropped adoption costs for the weekend by half, and also threw in a one-year licence, a collar and a bag of food and toys.

The discount may have been effective. On Saturday, the city thanked Calgarians for helping the cats find homes, noting that there's a limited number of adoptable cats left.

A list of cats available for adoption, or those that have been impounded and may be up for adoption in the next few days, can be viewed on the city's website.

The city's shelter isn't the only one in Calgary — other cats up for adoption can be found at the Calgary Humane Society, Alberta Animal Rescue Crew Society, the Meow Foundation, the Animal Rescue Foundation and Pawsitive Match.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/cat-adoption-calgary-1.5186517

A 13-year-old boy has gained 100,000 followers after being bullied about an Instagram account he used to talk about his favourite books.

Callum Manning, from South Shields , started his Instagram page Cal's Book Account so he could flag up books he liked to his friends.

But when people started sending insulting messages to a group chat he had joined at his new school, he was left ""devastated"".

""I don't tend to cry that often but I think that was the first time in a while I've actually cried,"" Callum told the PA news agency.

But things turned around when Callum's sister, Ellis Landreth, wrote about the incident on Twitter.

She posted a picture of Callum's Instagram account and wrote: ""Can't believe how awful kids are. My little brother's made an Instagram reviewing and talking about books and kids in his new school have seen it and have created a group chat calling him a creep slagging him off about it and added him to it so he could see.""

Ellis, 24, told PA she was hoping ""20 or 30 of my friends (would) like a few of his posts or follow him or give him some words of encouragement"".

But within a few hours he had amassed thousands of new followers as people who saw the tweet rushed to support him.

""People saw it and people just thought 'it's not right' because it isn't,"" Callum said. ""Then I started getting loads of comments from everyone showing their support.

""I just think it's really nice that there's still people in the world who are nice.""

By Sunday morning his follower count had surpassed 50,000, while shops, authors, publishers and members of the public were offering to send him more books to read and review.

Among those to contact him was Caroline Kepnes, author of the book You.

Callum said: ""She's one of my favourite authors - she texted us, which was really cool. Obviously I'm a really big fan so I was kind of nervous but that was really cool.""

Some of Callum's new followers have been surprised to see books by the likes of Jane Austen, George Orwell and Mary Shelley feature on his account, alongside Harry Potter and Twilight novels.

""He's a very, very clever kid,"" Callum's mum, Carla Landreth, told PA.

""He's been reading since he was really young but he reads like Crime And Punishment and stuff that probably not your average 13-year-old would be interested in reading.

""He reads everything and anything.""

And it seems his collection is about to get bigger as offers to send free books roll in from around the country.

""I don't know where we're going to put all these books,"" she said. ""I think we're going have to go to Ikea and get some bookcases.""

Ms Landreth, 43, hopes Callum's story will help spread the message that bullying should not be tolerated.

""On Friday night he was in tears,"" she said. ""He was absolutely devastated that people could be so cruel.

""And since this has been happening, his confidence has just soared. He's a lovely kid, he's a very loving kid, and he's just saying, 'I can't believe these people want to follow me on Instagram and want to send me stuff'.

""We're just so shocked. It's been absolutely brilliant. He's just over the moon.""

Callum added: ""I never thought this would ever happen, this just happened out of the blue, and it's just showed that there are good people in the world.""",https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/south-shields-bullying-reading-instagram-17842891

The criminal records of people previously convicted of marijuana-related crimes in New York will be expunged under a new law passed in the state.

New York Governor signed the bill into law on Wednesday, legalizing marijuana for adults across the state.

The new law will allow New Yorkers to possess three ounces of marijuana or less, and will let them grow up to three marijuana plants at home.

Anyone previously convicted of marijuana possession under the now-legal limit will have their convictions expunged and they will be re-sentenced, according to ABC News.

Further, according to the New York times, 40% of tax revenue from marijuana sales will be put toward communities where Black and Latino people have been disproportionately arrested on marijuana charges, and toward people who have had their sentences expunged.

It will also allow people involved in the illegal marijuana market as well as people with past marijuana convictions to take part in the new legal market.",https://www.businessinsider.com/new-york-expunge-marijuana-convictions-under-new-law-2021-3
Kraft Heinz to give employees Super Bowl Monday off,Kraft Heinz to give all of their salaried employees the day after the Super Bowl off instead of buying multi-million-dollar game ad,1.0,"Kraft Heinz plans to give their salaried employees the day after the Super Bowl off, in a stunt they hope will drum up enough publicity to substitute a pricey game ad.

The Chicago-based company announced their plans to forgo buying Super Bowl ad time on Wednesday, in favor of giving their employees a little R&R after the game-night festivities.

'The Heinz brand doesn't settle on delivering superior taste or quality, and we don't believe America should have to settle on the day after the best sports day of the year,' Nicole Kulwicki, head of Heinz brands, said in a press release.

Kraft Heinz is giving all of its salaried employees the day off after the Super Bowl instead of buying a multi-million-dollar game ad. They are also encouraging people to sign a petition to turn Super Bowl Monday - Smunday - into a national holiday

Super Bowl ad time is the year's most lucrative, and last year 30-second spots were estimated to cost $5million.

Giving their salaried employees the day off will also be pricey, since the company employed 42,000 employees at the end of 2015. The day off does not apply to the company's factory workers.

But the good press around 'Smunday' could make it worth their while.

In addition to promoting the effort in online videos released Wednesday, the company also started a Change.org petition to turn the Monday after the Super Bowl into a national holiday.

If the petition reaches 100,000 signatures, the company says they will sent it to Congress for consideration.

The idea has been gaining traction for some time since the Monday after the Super Bowl has long been notorious for absenteeism. And studies back up the fact that decreased productivity on the day amounts to the loss of a billion dollars on average.

The idea for the movement came from the same ad agency behind the company's weiner dogs stampede commercial for last year's Super Bowl.

'We loved ""Wiener Stampede"" as well. It was a great way for us to introduce the full Heinz Ketchup family. This year we're doing something different. We're always looking for ways to connect with our consumers. This is a cause that we felt that the American public feels strongly about. And we really wanted to rally behind that effort,' Nicole Kulwicki, head of the Heinz brand, told Adweek.",http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4157696/Kraft-Heinz-employees-Super-Bowl-Monday-off.html
"Elephant poaching, Africa: Has China’s ivory ban stemmed crisis?",China’s ivory ban having a positive impact on the African elephant,1.0,"WITH massive tusks that touched the ground, Satao towered over the rest of his herd.

One of the last great “tuskers”, the beast estimated to be around 50 years old was heralded as Kenya’s biggest, oldest, and arguably most iconic elephant. Tourists from around the world would flock to see Satao in his prime.

Yet his celebrity status, and the added protection it afforded him, was not enough to save Kenya’s most beloved bull elephant.

On May 30th, 2014, he was found dead. He was the victim of a poacher’s poisoned arrow. His face crudely hacked off. His ivory, gone.

Satao is just one casualty of the vicious ivory trade decimating the African elephant population; a trade that is estimated to cost Africa 20,000 to 30,000 elephants every year.

The continent’s current population is estimated to be as low as 415,000 — a decline of more than 100,000 since 2007.

However, it is not all bad news.

On December 31, 2017, China’s legal ivory trade ground to a standstill. China is thought to be the world’s largest consumer of ivory.

The move is in accordance with a 2015 announcement by Chinese President Xi Jinping and former US President Barack Obama. Both leaders vowed to enact “near complete” ivory bans within their respective countries.

America’s came into effect in June 2016.

In November last year, Donald Trump’s administration announced it would lift the ban on importing elephant hunt trophies from Zimbabwe and Zambia, but after a political backlash, Mr Trump put the decision on hold.

The benefits of the 2015 decision are already starting to be felt.

Craig Millar, Head of Security and Field Operations for Big Life Foundation, told news.com.au: “Since China’s ban on ivory has come into effect we’ve seen not so much a drop in poaching, but a drop in prices.

“Kenya has been showing a steady decline in poaching for the last three years, and I’m hoping this year it will be a decline again. We reacted quite quickly to the most recent ivory poaching crisis so our elephant population is probably one of the least affected over the last five years.”

Mr Millar added that a drop in prices is only a good thing.

“Immediately after the announcement, we saw prices drop by as much as 50 to 60 per cent. And that just means the poacher on the ground here is getting way less than anyone at the end of the supply chain, so there’s even less incentive for him to risk his life.

“China seems to have a pretty firm hold of what’s going on, and the government deciding against something seems to be pretty readily accepted.”

All that aside, the poaching crisis has left is scars in Kenya, and the people working on the front line of conservation are not exempt.

“There are two scenes that have stuck with me,” Mr Millar said. “There was one, where six elephants were killed in a single poaching incident. A whole family basically mowed down, and one of those happened to be a pregnant female. And just the other day I was flying, and I saw a baby elephant less than a month old get killed; not for its ivory, that was more a case of senseless human wildlife conflict. Those are the worst things I’ve ever seen on the job.”

In addition to being faced with such brutal scenes, Mr Millar and his team place their lives on the line on a daily basis to protect Big Life’s animals. The foundation currently manages an area just under two million acres.

“There are lots of times you feel personally threatened doing this job ... but we’ve been very lucky as we’ve never lost a ranger to a poacher, we’ve just had injuries,” he said.

The biggest impact has been on the animals themselves. The poaching crisis has brought around significant behavioural shifts.

Mr Millar has seen Big Life’s resident big tusker “One Ton” hide his tusks from human gaze by shoving his head into a bush on more than one occasion.

“They’re very clever. I’ve seen a number of other changes in the animals that can be attributed to poaching. Their behaviour changes drastically depending on which area they’re in. They know where they’re safe, and they’ll be very relaxed; One Ton in particular, you can almost touch if he’s in the right place. But you find him elsewhere, and he’s much more nervous. It goes to the extent when if an elephant has been killed, all other elephants will move away from the area for the next couple of days, even if they weren’t in the immediate vicinity — they pass that message along.”

It doesn’t stop there. If a bigger, older animal does get killed, it impacts the population for generations.

“Taking out an older female in a herd is taking out their knowledge store. Elephants teach their young for 20-30 years, and a female will be 40, close to 50, before she’s ready to take on that role as a matriarch. If you lose your top two or three females in a herd, suddenly the survivors aren’t going to know where to find water in the dry season, where the best forage is, how to protect each other.

“Males are hugely affected in that they bred right up until their old age. They only slowdown in the last four to five years of their life. Taking out those big males means suddenly you’re getting immature males breeding, and passing on an inferior gene pool because they haven’t really proven themselves.”

While China’s ban on ivory has had a positive impact, the plight of the African elephant is far from over. Human wildlife conflict is still a very real threat.

“The recent incident involving the baby elephant is an example. A lot of our rangers’ time is now spent dealing with keeping elephants out of farms, or people out of areas where the animals are likely to be dangerous,” Mr Millar explained.

“We’re looking at land-use plans, and implementing large scale electrified fencing of areas. The fences have to be electric, it’s the only thing that stops elephants, and the fences have to be a specific design as well. It’s hugely expensive. It’s about $A13.8 per km, we’ve done about 60 kms now, and we’re looking at doing at least another 100 kms in the next two years. Sadly, the biggest problem facing nearly everyone in conservation is funds.”

Study Finds Bees Don't Just Love Cannabis — it Can Also Help Save Their Dying Populations,Bees don't just love cannabis. It can also help save their dying populations,1.0,"Humans aren’t the only ones who seem to gravitate towards the marijuana plant. Turns out, even bees love the buzz, but for a slightly different reason. A new study by researchers at Cornell University published in the journal of Environmental Entomology finds that bees are super attracted to the cannabis plants because they can’t get enough of its sweet, sweet pollen. This study supports the results of a similar one conducted by Colorado University last year and opens up options for scientists to save the depleting bee population around the world.

The study found that the taller the cannabis plants are and the larger area they cover, the more bees will flock to that farm, with taller plants attracting 17 times more buzz than the shorter ones. What’s even cooler is that there are 16 different varieties of the marijuana plant that could support these bee populations. But even as bees seem to love the cannabis plant, they can’t actually get high off it since insects aren’t known to have any cannabinoid receptors.

These findings are kinda confusing when you consider that cannabis neither has a nectary taste nor the vibrant colours that generally catch the attention of bees. However, the bees are more into the male plants that usually grow alongside the flowering female ones that produce the bud you put into your bongs, but have no psychoactive properties. This study is especially crucial given that bees are responsible for the cross-pollination of flowers that furthers the growth of the fruits and vegetables we need for survival. Except, thanks to pesticides, habit destruction and climate change, the bees seem to be buzzing off, something that the marijuana plant could help put a stop to since they also don’t generally use too many pesticides, nor require too much water for their growth.

But what’s even better about these canna-bees is that they bring with them immense industrial potential. Israeli cannabis technology company PhytoPharma International developed a natural cannabinoid-dosed honey that allows bees to fuse THC and CBD into their honey by an IP-protected pollination process. Now if that’s not worth the buzz, we don’t know what is.",http://vice.com/en/article/epgb7n/study-finds-bees-dont-just-love-cannabis-it-can-also-help-save-their-dying-populations
Couple finds $1.8 million lottery ticket while cleaning before Thanksgiving,Couple finds $1.8 million lottery ticket while cleaning before Thanksgiving,1.0,"A couple made their house and their bank account look like a million bucks while cleaning up ahead of having family over for Thanksgiving.

Tina and Harold Ehrenberg were prepping their home in Mandeville, Louisiana, for Thanksgiving festivities when they found some old lottery tickets on the nightstand — including a winner worth $1.8 million.

The couple found the winning Louisiana Lottery ticket just in time, too, as it was set to expire in two weeks. The lucky ticket was from the June 6 drawing, and prizes must be claimed within 180 days of the drawing.

""The most fun is going to be depositing that check,"" Harold Ehrenberg told NBC affiliate WDSU.

No word on whether the couple has been playing the same numbers for 25 years — like this man — or accidentally bought the wrong ticket and won anyway — hey, it's happened — but it all added up to some good fortune.

The Ehrenbergs went online to check the numbers on the lottery's website and found out it was going to be a very happy Thanksgiving.

They will receive $1,274,313 after taxes, which they said they plan to put away for retirement.

Wisconsin Church Hosts Thanksgiving for LGBTQ People Who Can’t Go Home,Wisconsin Church Hosts Thanksgiving for LGBTQ People Who Can’t Go Home,1.0,"A local advocacy group organized the free event to give LGBTQ people rejected by their biological families a place to go.

A church in Beloit, Wis., hosted its third annual Thanksgiving dinner for LGBTQ locals who may be unable to celebrate with their biological families.

The free event was organized by the Yellow Brick Road advocacy group and held at the First Congregational Church in Beloit, a city of about 30,000 people in southern Wisconsin.

Yellow Brick Road organizers told the local CNN affiliate that they held the event to give LGBTQ people rejected by their biological families a place to go. “They can’t go home to their families because of who they choose to be so we give them a safe place to come have dinner and meet new people,” said Yellow Brick Road president Jen Schuler.

“Having someone not accept you is really hard but when it’s someone as close with your family it’s much harder,” added Yellow Brick Road leader Marilyn Schuh.

“We all deserve a place at a Thanksgiving table where we feel loved and accepted. Thanksgiving is about coming together and giving thanks for those people we love in our life. We couldn't think of anyone else we would rather spend this day with than you!” reads the event’s description on Facebook.

Organizers told the CNN affiliate that the event has grown over the years to include straight allies too.

""This is about equal rights. This is about being a human and having human decency towards one another,” said Schuler.

Yellow Brick Road hosts a number of other yearly events, including a costume ball in the spring and Pridefest in the summer.

Events like these can help LGBTQ people feel connected and supported in the face of ostracism. In a 2013 Pew survey, about four in ten LGBTQ people reported being rejected by a friend or family member. LGBTQ youth are at a much higher risk of becoming homeless.

And lesbian, gay, and bisexual adults who reported high levels of teenage rejection from parents were more likely to have attempted suicide, to have depression, and to use drugs than those who didn’t, according to a study published in Pediatrics in 2009.",https://www.advocate.com/news/2019/11/29/wisconsin-church-hosts-thanksgiving-lgbtq-people-who-cant-go-home
Publix is buying excess milk and produce from farmers — and donating it to food banks,Publix is buying excess milk and produce from farmers — and donating it to food banks,1.0,"Farmers around the country have been forced to dump milk and waste fresh produce as schools, restaurants and other institutions remain closed due to the coronavirus pandemic. In response, Supermarket chain Publix launched a new initiative Wednesday to help struggling farmers — and get the food to Americans who need it most.

The company's press release said it will purchase fresh produce and milk from farmers impacted by the COVID-19 crisis and donate the goods directly to Feeding America food banks that are in its ""operating area."" During the first week of the initiative alone, some 150,000 pounds of produce and 43,500 gallons of milk is expected to be donated, the company said.

""As a food retailer, we have the unique opportunity to bridge the gap between the needs of families and farmers impacted by the coronavirus pandemic,"" said Todd Jones, Publix CEO. ""In addition to providing much needed produce and milk to food banks, this initiative provides financial support to farmers during this challenging time.""



The company will purchase food from Florida produce farmers and southeastern dairy farmers through the initiative. It is kicking off Wednesday and is ""expected to run for several weeks,"" according to the release.



In addition to the new initiative, Publix Super Markets Charities recently made donations which totaled $2 million to help Feeding America's member food banks amid the crisis.

Woman finds her corgi comforting grieving stranger in the airport,Woman finds her corgi comforting grieving stranger in the airport,1.0,"Madison Palm has always known her dog Cora is special. It's why she's having Cora trained and certified as a therapy dog; it's why she always travels with her.

""She is very empathetic and in tune with my needs, yet she is so incredibly independent,"" Palm told TODAY.

The 23-year-old was still surprised, and deeply moved, by something Cora did when the two were recently flying from their home in Idaho to Alaska to visit Palm's mother.

On a layover at the Seattle airport, Cora approached a man who was sitting by himself near their gate.

""Before I could even call her she was already at his feet being loved on. I asked him if she was bothering him,"" Palm said. ""And with a somber face and watery eyes he said, 'No, no. I lost my dog last night.'""

Palm was deeply moved that her dog Cora seemed to know just who needed her attention. @the.corgi.cora

Cora stayed with the man for a little while. Palm, who lives in Coeur d’Alene in northern Idaho, recalls the man scratched behind Cora's ears, petted her and whispered to her about how cute she is. It was a profoundly emotional encounter to witness.

""I truly think she has a gift. She knows who is hurting and she knows who needs her,"" she said. ""Once he told me that his dog passed away I looked at Cora and I thought to myself, 'You are so amazing. How did I get so lucky?'""

""Totally the kind of dog she is — she will walk up to a crying child and try to lick them and rub her head on them. She lives for making people happy again,"" Palm said of Cora. @the.corgi.cora

This is how: Cora has lived with Palm since last summer. Palm, who is a deputy assessor title clerk at her county's Department of Motor Vehicles, was in the break room at work. A co-worker was browsing Facebook on her phone and told Palm she'd seen a post about a corgi who was killing a family's chickens and was therefore being given away to the first person who came for her.

Palm left work right away to meet the dog. She learned the dog was underfed and had been kept outside for nearly her whole life. She'd had many litters of puppies.

""Cora had never been to a vet,"" Palm said. ""She didn’t have a cute collar or a shiny tag with her name on it. The little food that she received was her owners' scraps, which were thrown into the yard for her.""

Palm already had another dog and knew her landlord wouldn't allow two. She'd have to find a new place to live if she took in Cora, but Palm felt she couldn't leave the dog behind.

On the drive home, Cora crawled into Palm's lap ""and she never looked back,"" Palm said.

""Cora has taught me the true meaning of unconditional love and forgiveness in a way that no person could have explained,"" said Palm. @the.corgi.cora

Cora's ears were infected, her teeth were rotted and the water turned black when she got her first bath. But her personality was, and is, sweet and loving.

""She just wants to be loved on and held all day long,"" said Palm. ""She is always right next to me and always keeps a close eye if she’s not. If I’m not available she’ll pick the next closest lap to sit in.""

They found a new place to live. The dogs both like it; they've got a yard.

Cora, who is becoming a therapy dog through the American Kennel Club's canine good citizen program, is a great comfort to Palm. She helps her with anxiety. Palm says Cora ""helps me stay calm in chaos.""

Cora celebrated her 8th birthday on Nov. 1. Palm gave Cora ""the canned version of her dog food and tried to make a little cake for her with a candle that said 8,"" she said. @the.corgi.cora

It had been seven months of feeling amazed by Cora's capacity for forgiveness and for love. Then Cora reached out to this grieving stranger in an airport, and Palm was astonished all over again by this dog, who early in her life wasn't given a lot of reasons to trust or even like humans, but still does.

""I am blown away by her on a daily basis. Who knew a dog who was unloved for 7 1/2 years could have so much love to give?"" Palm said. ""I can’t change her past but I’m doing everything I can to make up for it.""",https://www.today.com/pets/woman-finds-her-corgi-comforting-grieving-stranger-airport-t123460

As reported by the FADER, the rapper took the stage at Sunday's MTV Video Music Awards with artists Alessia Cara and Khalid, surrounded by suicide attempt survivors, to make a public plea for mental health awareness and suicide prevention with the tune from his recent album, Everybody. The empathetic performance apparently moved the needle, as the the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline received a reported 50-percent increase in calls.

“It's not just about the calls,” John Draper, director of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, tells CNN about Logic's VMAs showing. “It's about increasing awareness about suicide, and suicide prevention in particular. The calls don't even begin to count the number of people who, just by listening to the song and hearing the lyrics, feel more hopeful and less alone.”

“This past year, our audience was forced to say goodbye to musicians too soon because of suicide,” says the VMAs' executive producer Garret English, alluding to the recent deaths of both Linkin Park's Chester Bennington and Soundgarden's Chris Cornell. “We want to do more than remember these artists. We want to remind people that suicide is preventable and that there are ways to get help and feel better if you're struggling emotionally.”

Logic joins a growing list of musicians helping to push mental health issues to the collective fore, including recent exhortations from bands such as Foo Fighters, and artists like Real Friends' Dan Lambton and Clown from Slipknot.

Maine becomes the first state to ban Styrofoam,Maine becomes the first state to ban Styrofoam,1.0,"(CNN) Food containers made of Styrofoam, also known as polystyrene, will be officially banned from businesses in Maine after governor Janet Mills signed a bill into law Tuesday.

The law, which will go into effect January 1, 2021, prohibits restaurants, caterers, coffee shops and grocery stores from using the to-go foam containers because they cannot be recycled in Maine.

Maine has become the first state to take such a step as debate about banning plastic bags or other disposable products is spreading across the nation.

While states like New York and California have banned single-use plastic bags, others such as Tennessee and Florida have made it illegal for local municipalities to regulate them.

Maryland's legislature also has approved bills to ban polystyrene , but it's unclear whether Republican Gov. Larry Hogan will sign the legislation. Democratic Delegate Brooke Lierman, the primary sponsor of the Maryland House bill, said banning foam products was the first step to curbing people's reliance on single-use plastics.

""Polystyrene cannot be recycled like a lot of other products, so while that cup of coffee may be finished, the Styrofoam cup it was in is not,"" Mills said in a statement to CNN affiliate WMTW. ""In fact, it will be around for decades to come and eventually it will break down into particles, polluting our environment, hurting our wildlife, and even detrimentally impacting our economy.""

The Maine law, originally proposed by Rep. Stanley Zeigler (D-Montville), also applies to plastic beverage stirrers.

Those who violate the law could face a fine of up to $100, News Center Maine reports

""Maine has proven itself an environmental leader once again, this time in eliminating disposable foam containers that have become a common, costly, and deadly form of plastic pollution,"" said Sarah Lakeman, Sustainable Maine Director at the Natural Resources Council of Maine (NRCM), in a statement.

""With the threats posed by plastic pollution becoming more apparent, costly, and even deadly to wildlife, we need to be doing everything possible to limit our use and better manage our single-use plastics — starting with eliminating the use of unnecessary forms like plastic foam.""

The NRCM reports that plastic foam food containers are among the top 10 most commonly littered items in the US.

More than 256 million pieces of disposable foam cups, plates, bowls, platters, and trays are used every year in Maine, the NRCM says.

Some 15 towns in the state have already banned foam food containers, it says.

The reason why Styrofoam is difficult to clean up is that it easily breaks into smaller pieces, according to Ashley Van Stone, executive director of Trash Free Maryland.

Foam also absorbs toxins faster than other plastics and is mistaken for food by marine life, Van Stone said. And the toxins that wildlife consumes makes its way up the food chain into people.",https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/01/us/maine-ban-styrofoam-trnd/index.html
FBI rescues 82 children in nationwide sex trafficking sting,FBI rescues 82 children in nationwide sex trafficking sting,1.0,"COLUMBUS(WCMH/AP) – The FBI says dozens of pimps, prostitutes and associates have been arrested under international efforts to combat underage human trafficking.

The FBI says 239 child-sex traffickers and their associates were arrested and 82 children were rescued from Oct. 13 to 16 as part of Operation Cross Country X.

This is a depressing day in law enforcement,” said FBI Director Comey, “because this is the world we live in and the work we have to do.” But it is also a proud day for law enforcement, he added, “because there are people who spend every day worrying about how to rescue these children. They are true heroes.”

Among the 82 juveniles recovered during the three day operation were two sisters in Milwaukee, ages 16 and 17, who told authorities that their mother was their pimp, the FBI said in a news release. The girls said their mother also rented out their brother’s room to a registered sex offender.

Operation Cross Country is part of the FBI’s Innocence Lost National Initiative. Since its creation in 2003, the program has resulted in the identification and recovery of more than 6,000 children from child sex trafficking.

“Operation Cross Country aims to shine a spotlight into the darkest corners of our society that seeks to prey on the most vulnerable of our population,” said FBI Director Comey. “We are not only looking to root out those who engage in the trafficking of minors, but through our Office for Victim Assistance, we offer a lifeline to minors to help them escape from a virtual prison no person ever deserves.”

Blood test detects proteins linked to Alzheimer's disease,A blood test to detect early signs of Alzheimer’s disease has been developed.,1.0,"(CNN) A team of scientists from Australia and Japan has developed a blood test to detect early signs of Alzheimer's disease.

The noninvasive test was developed to detect the presence of the toxic protein amyloid beta, known to be present in people affected by the disease, and did so with 90% accuracy, according to the study, published Wednesday in the journal Nature

The team trialed the test on 121 patients from Japan and 252 from Australia with varying levels of health, ranging from healthy to mild cognitive impairments or Alzheimer's disease.

The idea behind the test is to predict the presence and levels of amyloid beta in a person's brain. Buildup of the abnormal protein in the brain is one sign of Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia.

Other teams have developed similar tests to detect Alzheimer's, with one 2017 study proving to have 86% sensitivity and specificity.

""This test is at least as good as current brain scan techniques and far surpasses existing blood tests,"" said Colin Masters, professor of dementia research at Melbourne's Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health, who led the study.

But the researchers cautioned that they were still far from practical clinical application.

The onset of Alzheimer's can come as early as 30 years before the patient experiences any symptoms, such as memory loss.

There is no concrete test to determine early onset of dementia, and patients with cognitive impairment are diagnosed based on a careful evaluation using brain scans and concise mental testing, according to the Alzheimer's Society UK.

The study used blood samples from patients to detect levels of the toxic protein in the blood and in turn predict how much of it is in the brain.

There is no treatment available for Alzheimer's disease, but early detection can speed access to therapy.

""Progress in developing new therapeutic strategies for Alzheimer's disease has been disappointingly slow. None of the three drugs currently on the market treat the underlying disease,"" Masters said in a statement.

The team highlights that more research needs to be conducted across a wider population to make the results more conclusive -- and applicable clinically.

""This is not a blood test for dementia that people who are worried about their memory and concentration should be asking their doctors about,"" said Rob Howard, professor of old age psychiatry at University College London, who was not involved in the study. ""Not everyone with amyloid in their brains will turn out to have dementia, and not everyone who has dementia will be found to have amyloid in their brains.""

In the UK, there are more than 520,000 people affected by the disease, costing £26.3 billion, according to the Alzheimer's Society.

Though the new study provides a breakthrough in research, it is performed only in laboratories in Japan, where it will take up to a year to conform it to a level suitable to distribute to other laboratories and apply it to clinical trials.

""We need to see whether the test works in a larger population, but it has the potential both to speed up clinical trials and help people in the very early stages of Alzheimer's to access new treatments if and when they become available,"" said Doug Brown, policy and research officer at the Alzheimer's Society UK.

Carol Routledge, director of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said that ""further work with more people will need to build on this study to understand how well this approach could predict those who will go on to develop symptoms of Alzheimer's in the future.""",https://edition.cnn.com/2018/02/01/health/alzheimers-blood-test-study-intl/index.html
Rare black panther confirmed in Kenya,Black leopard spotted in Africa for first time in 100 years.,1.0,"The headline was updated on February 13 to clarify that this is the first scientifically documented sighting since 1909.

They say that black cats bring bad luck, but when Nick Pilfold heard about one lurking around central Kenya, he knew he was onto something special.

The Kenya-based biologist and his team deployed a set of camera traps throughout the bushlands of Loisaba Conservancy in early 2018. It wasn't long before he got what he was looking for: undeniable proof of a super-rare melanistic leopard.

0:33

The juvenile female was spotted traveling with a larger, normally colored leopard, presumed to be her mother. (See our exclusive picture of a rare black wildcat seen in Africa.)

The opposite of albinism, melanism is the result of a gene that causes a surplus of pigment in the skin or hair of an animal so that it appears black. Melanistic leopards have been reported in and around Kenya for decades, but scientific confirmation of their existence remains quite rare.

Published in January in the African Journal of Ecology, these photos represent the first scientific documentation of such a creature in Africa in nearly a century.

As recently as 2017, only a single sighting had been confirmed—a 1909 photograph taken in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and stored in the collections of the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. Their range across much of the continent has shrunk by at least 66 percent due to habitat loss and prey decline.

""Almost everyone has a story about seeing one, it's such a mythical thing,"" says Pilfold, of San Diego Zoo Global's Institute for Conservation Research.

""Even when you talk to the older guys that were guides in Kenya many years ago, back when hunting was legal [in the 1950s and ‘60s], there was a known thing that you didn't hunt black leopards. If you saw them, you didn't take it.""

Life in the shade

There are nine leopard subspecies ranging from Africa all the way to eastern Russia. And while 11 percent of leopards alive today are thought to be melanistic, says Pilfold, most are found in Southeast Asia, where tropical forests offer an abundance of shade.

It's thought that melanism provides additional camouflage in those habitats, giving the predators an advantage when it comes to hunting, says Vincent Naude, leopard genetic forensics project coordinator for the nonprofit Panthera, who was not involved with this research.

But in Kenya, black leopards, sometimes referred to as ""black panthers”—an umbrella term that refers to any big cat with a black coat—seem to occur in semi-arid shrubland.

""Our leopards live in savannah-type environments, so having that extra melanism doesn't give them an adaptive advantage,"" says Naude. Even still, given their nocturnal lifestyle, a bit of additional pigmentation certainly doesn't hurt. (Also see ""'Strawberry' Leopard Discovered—A First."")

1:01

The fact the young female was traveling with her mother also suggests that her unique coloration hasn't had an impact on familial bonding, Pilfold notes.

Comical coincidence

After hearing about Pilfold's findings, staff at Ol Ari Nyiro Conservancy—30 miles west of Loisaba—turned up a high-quality image of a second black leopard, taken in May 2007.

Since that photo is more than a decade older, the researchers conclude it must be of a different individual, which suggests black panthers are more prevalent in Kenya than in other African countries.

But African black panthers are still so rare that researchers don't even know if the genetic mutation responsible for the dark pigmentation is the same one that underlies melanism in Southeast Asian leopards.

Pilfold adds it’s curious that the fictional country of Wakanda, home of the superhero Black Panther, is located in East Africa, fairly close to Kenya.

""It's a unique coincidence,"" says Pilfold. ""The only place where we have black leopards is where this place in the Marvel Universe appears to exist.""",https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2019/02/rare-black-panther-spotted-in-africa-century

Gorilla hugging man who saved her life wins Photographer of the Year,Gorilla hugging man who saved her life wins Photographer of the Year,1.0,"The People’s Choice award in the Natural History Museum’s Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition went to this photo of a lowland gorilla and the man who saved her (Picture: Wildlife Photographer of the Year)

A tender hug between a lowland gorilla and the man who saved her life has been crowned the winner of the Wildlife Photographer of the Year People’s Choice award.

Photographer Jo-Anne McArthur took the photo in Cameroon, as the rescued gorilla – named Pikin – was being moved between animal sanctuaries.

More young people want to ditch Royal Family than keep it for first time ever

Pikin had been captured by poachers to be sold for bushmeat but luckily, charity group Ape Action Africa stepped in at the last minute.

Primate poaching, which is rife in Cameroon, sees hunters slaughter wild animals in order to sell their meat both in their country of origin and abroad.

Baby apes are often left orphaned after their mothers are killed and either die in the wild or are sold on as pets.

Pikin was being moved to a new enclosure within a safe forest sanctuary but woke up during her transfer when her sedation wore off.

Luckily, she woke up in the arms of her caretaker, Appolinaire Ndohoudou, a man she shared a particular bond with.

Like Pikin, Appolinaire was forced from his home, having fled Chad because of a civil war.

As he rebuilt his life in Cameroon, his work in protecting wild animals revived his appreciation for the natural world.

Jo-Anne captured the moment the two travelled together – which became the winning photo chosen by the public in the competition run by the Natural History Museum.

It was chosen from a shortlist of 24, selected by staff at the museum from almost 50,000 entries.

The picture will now be showcased in the Wildlife Photographer of the Year exhibition at the Museum until it closes on May 28.

The finalists

Sloth hanging out by Luciano Candisani (Picture: Wildlife Photographer of the Year)

Luciano Candisani had to climb the cecropia tree, in the protected Atlantic rainforest of southern Bahia, Brazil, to take an eye-level shot of this three-toed sloth.

Sloths like to feed on the leaves of these trees and so they are often seen high up in the canopy.

Elegant mother and calf by Ray Chin (Picture: Wildlife Photographer of the Year)

Every year from July to late October southern humpback whales migrate north from their Antarctic feeding grounds to give birth in the warm sheltered waters off Tonga.

Ray encountered this humpback mother and calf peacefully floating in the plankton-filled water around the island group of Vava’u, Tonga.

After Ray gently approached them, the giants swam a bit closer to have alook at him and he captured this shot as they turned around.

Roller rider by Lakshitha Karunarathna (Picture: Wildlife Photographer of the Year)

Lakshitha was on safari in MaasaiMara National Reserve, Kenya, when he spotted a lilac-breasted roller riding a zebra.

Normally they prefer to perch high up in the foliage, but this roller spent an hour or more riding around and enjoying the occasional insect meal.

Lakshitha waited for the surrounding zebras to form the perfect background before taking this tight crop.

Warm embrace by Debra Garside (Picture: Wildlife Photographer of the Year)

When polar bear mothers and cubs emerge from their dens in the early spring, the cubs stay close to their mothers for warmth and protection.

Once the cubs are strong and confident enough, they make the trek to the sea ice with their mother so that she can resume hunting for seals.

Debra waited six days near the den of this family, in Wapusk National Park, Manitoba, Canada, before they finally emerged.

She risked frostbite in freezing conditions to capture the shot.

Chinese movie legend Chow Yun-fat says he plans to give his entire net worth, a whopping $5.6 billion HKD (that’s $714 million USD) to charity. “My dream is to be a happy and normal person,” Yun-fat recently told Hong Kong movie site Jayne Stars. “The hardest thing in life is not about how much money you earn, but how to keep a peaceful mindset and live the rest of your life in a simple and carefree manner.” The same site reported earlier that the actor claimed to spend only $800 HKD ($102 USD) per month.

Apparently, he stays frugal by taking public transportation as often as possible and doing charity work instead of spending it on himself. He also had a Nokia phone for 17 years (we can only assume it’s a flip phone), and only upgraded to a smart phone recently, when his Nokia one stopped working. He shops at discount clothing stores, because, he said: “I don’t wear clothes for other people. As long as I think it’s comfortable, then it’s good enough for me.”

A repeat player in John Woo films such as “A Better Tomorrow,” “The Killer,” and “Hard Boiled,” Yun-fat is best known to U.S. audiences for his role in Ang Lee’s martial arts film “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,” which won Best Foreign Language Film at the 2000 Academy Awards. Yun-fat played Li Mu Bai opposite Michelle Yeoh (“Crazy Rich Asians”) as Yu Shu Lien.

Superhero! SU football legend Jim Brown rescues Stan Lee's dog (report),"Stan Lee's Missing Dog Found, Returned by NFL Legend Jim Brown",1.0,"Syracuse football legend Jim Brown has played an action hero in movies, but he's also a hero in real life to the man behind some of the biggest superheroes in comics history.

TMZ reports Stan Lee, the co-creator of Marvel characters like Daredevil, Iron Man, Spider-Man, Black Panther, X-Men and the Fantastic Four, lost his dog last week. Sources say the 95-year-old comics legend's mini Pomeranian, Charlotte, got loose in the Los Angeles area and had been missing for several days.

Lee's team posted ""Lost Dog"" flyers around his Hollywood Hills neighborhood, but hadn't heard anything for several days.

Brown, who lives about a mile away from Lee, and his wife Monique found Charlotte in their yard with no collar. They contacted several neighbors and took the pooch to a vet, but had no luck.

""The Browns then went old school and canvassed several neighborhoods and BAM,"" TMZ wrote. ""They saw the posters, called the number and just like that, Charlotte was reunited with Stan.""

That's good news for Lee, who's had a rough year. His wife of 69 years died in July; he was accused of sexually harassing nurses in January; $1.4 million went missing in a possible financial elder abuse case; and he was hospitalized last month due to pneumonia and other health issues.

It's unclear if there'll be a reward for Brown, an NFL Hall of Famer who excelled in football, basketball, track and field, and lacrosse while at Syracuse University. Maybe the 82-year-old No. 44 can get a role in a Marvel superhero movie; he's got acting experience in films like ""The Dirty Dozen,"" ""The Running Man,"" ""I'm Gonna Git You Sucka"" and ""Any Given Sunday.""",http://www.syracuse.com/sports/index.ssf/2018/03/jim_brown_stan_lee_dog.html

Yale's massively popular 'happiness' course is available free online,Yale's massively popular 'happiness' course is available free online,1.0,"(CNN) As you're spending more time at home and working to stay sane during the coronavirus pandemic, you might be able to find solace in Yale University's mega-popular ""happiness"" course, which is available for free online through Coursera.

""We're in a particularly challenging time not just for this health crisis, this physical health crisis, but also a potential mental health crisis as well,"" course creator Laurie Santos, a Yale psychology professor, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour this week.

The course went online for free about two years ago under the name ""The Science of Well Being,"" according to the Yale Daily News. Anyone can audit the course for free, and $49 lets you complete assignments, submit them for a grade and earn a certificate of completion.

Although in-person social connections matter, Santos says the good news from science is that much of happiness stems from cultivating healthy practices and routines.

And the dramatic reorientation of your life might actually give you an opportunity in the coming weeks to rethink your daily rituals and therefore rewire your brain toward a happier life.

Anchorage funds a new mental health first responder team,"With money taken from a new alcohol tax, Anchorage funds a mental health first responder team.",1.0,"Starting next year, Anchorage will change its approach to dealing with people experiencing a mental health crisis.

With new money from an alcohol tax, the city will fund a team of mental health first responders that can take the place of a police officer when responding to someone with a mental health issue.

The idea is that first responders trained in mental health can be dispatched to situations that police are not trained to respond to. Anchorage Assemblywoman Meg Zaletel, one of the sponsors, said that will better suit the needs of the person in crisis while easing the burden on the Anchorage Police Department.

Zaletel, an attorney who has practiced mental health law for 15 years, called it a “fundamental shift” to the local response system. She championed the idea, along with Assemblymen Chris Constant and Forrest Dunbar and Acting Mayor Austin Quinn-Davidson.

There are details in the press release, but the basic premise is this: our police receive thousands of calls every year for people in mental health crisis. Our officers are not social workers or behavioral health specialists, though they are often pressed into service as such. — Forrest Dunbar (@ForrestDunbarAK) November 18, 2020

Right now, when police respond to someone in a mental health crisis, Zaletel said the person often ends up in jail or a psychiatric unit at the hospital. Those can be traumatic experiences, and not necessarily the correct response.

The Mobile Crisis Team will aim to provide a tailored response, as well as limit situations that could result in a violent interaction between police and a member of the public.

“It’s the right tool for the job and I think we need to recognize that the Anchorage Police Department was already looking at models like this,” she said.

Following the passage of the municipality’s budget last week, which included funding for the Mobile Crisis Team, the Anchorage Police Department issued a statement supporting the program.

“This is an important step forward for our community in meeting the needs of those in crisis,” Deputy Chief Kenneth McCoy said in the statement. “We intently studied communities in the Lower 48 who were using the Mobile Crisis Team model and are pleased to see this first step in addressing the need.”

Celeste Hodge Growden, president of the Alaska Black Caucus, said the team will be a valuable resource especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, when everyone is facing increased stress and anxiety.

Hodge Growden in an interview listed off fatal interactions between people of color and the police throughout the country. She said in many stressful situations, law enforcement is not what’s needed.

“We just have unfortunately too many situations that show overrepresentation of people of color experiencing the brunt of situations like this, and I think compassionate care is what’s needed, and to resolve the situation in a way that doesn’t get someone killed,” she said.

The program initially is expected to cost $1.5 million. For the first half of the year, it will operate 12 hours per day, seven days a week. A team will consist of a paramedic and a behavioral health clinician as well as a unit commander.

The alcohol tax is projected to bring in more than $11 million per year, though Zaletel said there hasn’t yet been a new projection that considers the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

She said after the first quarter of 2021, there will be a more accurate idea of how much money the tax will bring in.

The tax will also go to fund domestic violence prevention programs, prekindergarten, child abuse prevention programs, substance misuse treatment and housing and shelter for the homeless.

Zaletel said the hope is that by July 1 there will be a better idea of available funding and data from the first six months of the Mobile Crisis Team to make a case for increasing the program to 24-hour coverage.

That, Zaletel said, would divert an estimated 7,300 calls annually from the police.

“That’s quite a cost savings to APD,” she said.

Hodge Growden said she will continue to push for city leaders to better fund things like crisis intervention.

“This is the beginning,” she said. “This is just our first step.”

It’s also intended to be a proactive step that would limit the burden on other intervention systems. Within 24 hours of the crisis team’s initial response, they will follow up with the person and refer them to other services, like a counselor.

Zaletel said it could be the case where the cause of a crisis is rooted in food insecurity. The team could follow up and inform the person of the various food pantries. The idea is to deal with the root of the problem rather than allowing it to spiral.",https://www.adn.com/alaska-news/anchorage/2020/11/24/anchorage-funds-a-new-mental-health-first-responder-team/

Walt Disney Company to eliminate plastic straws and more by 2019,Walt Disney Company to eliminate plastic straws and more by 2019,1.0,"The Walt Disney Company is set to eliminate single-use plastic straws and plastic stirrers at all its owned and operated locations across the globe by mid-2019, the company announced Thursday. This includes all parks with the exception of Disney Tokyo.

That elimination amounts to a reduction of more than 175 million straws and 13 million stirrers annually, the company said.

The move comes on the heels of an announcement from Starbucks earlier this month that would phase out single-use plastic straws from its more than 28,000 stores worldwide by 2020.

“Eliminating plastic straws and other plastic items are meaningful steps in our long-standing commitment to environmental stewardship,” said Bob Chapek, Chairman, Disney Parks, Experiences, and Consumer Products. “These new global efforts help reduce our environmental footprint, and advance our long-term sustainability goals.”

For patrons of Disney hotels and Disney cruise ships, there are additional changes coming.

Over the next several years there will be a transition to refillable in-room amenities, a move that is expected to reduce plastic by 80 percent, the company estimates.

The company also said they will reduce the number of single-use plastic shopping bags in owned and operated parks and on cruise ships, offering guests the option to purchase reusable bags.

“Disney has always been inspired by nature -- and it is a uniquely powerful brand that inspires, educates, and entertains, all at the same time,” said Dr. M. Sanjayan, CEO of Conservation International, a non-profit with which Disney has collaborated on environmental and sustainability initiatives.

“Today’s announcement is more than about reducing single-use plastic waste, it’s also about showing millions of kids and adults from around the world the many ways we can change our daily habits to care for the oceans and protect nature that sustains us all,"" Sanjayan said. ""It also builds on Disney’s longstanding commitment to conservation and environmental stewardship, a legacy that stretches from the highlands of Peru to the islands of the South Pacific.”

In addition to the Walt Disney Company and Starbucks, McDonald's announced in June that it would scrap plastic straws from restaurant locations in the U.K. and Ireland and replace them with paper straws, starting in September. Vail Resorts, owner of Northstar, Heavenly and Kirkwood at Lake Tahoe and sister resorts in Colorado, Utah, British Columbia, Vermont and the Midwest, has also banned plastic straws.

Hospitals Sued to Keep Prices Secret. They Lost.,Hospitals Sued to Keep Prices Secret. They Lost. - The New York Times,1.0,"A federal judge has upheld a Trump administration policy that requires hospitals and health insurers to publish their negotiated prices for health services, numbers that are typically kept secret.

The policy is part of a major push by the administration to improve transparency in health care. Insurers and health providers usually negotiate deals behind closed doors, and patients rarely know the cost of services until after the fact.

Administration officials said more price transparency would lead to lower and more predictable prices in an industry that has huge ranges in what insurers pay for services. A simple blood test, for example, can cost $11 or $1,000. Coronavirus tests show a similar variation, with prices from $27 to $2,315.

But in a lawsuit, the American Hospital Association said the administration did not have the legal authority to require the publication of negotiated prices, arguing that the publication of the prices could have perverse effects. On Tuesday, the judge, Carl Nichols, disagreed.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/upshot/hospitals-lost-price-transparency-lawsuit.html
"A 6th-grade teacher wrote 'Invite me to your Harvard graduation!' -- 21 years later, the student did just that","A 6th-grade teacher wrote 'Invite me to your Harvard graduation!' -- 21 years later, the student did just that",1.0,"A sixth-grade teacher from Yuma, Arizona, Toensing made a strong impact on one of her students 21 years ago.

At the end of the school year in 1997, Mrs. Toensing, wrote a note on the student's report card: ""It has been a joy to have you in class. Keep up the good work! Invite me to your Harvard graduation!.""

This week, the student, Christin Gilmer graduated from Harvard as a doctor of public health.

Gilmer who is now 33, was only 12 at the time, but she kept the message all these years.

""It meant a lot to me to know that outside my mom, someone who knew me so intimately believed in my dreams and my ability to accomplish them,"" Gilmer told CNN.

Gilmer, who wrote a thank you note prior to her graduation, said Toensing was the first person to encourage her in the journey of studying public health.

""Ms. Judy Toensing, taught me about current events, global health, and human rights. She was the first person who passionately conveyed the plight of people living with HIV/AIDS to me,"" the letter said.

This letter quickly grabbed the attention of school administrators, who decided to honor Toensing by inviting her to the 2018 Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health's convocation, at no cost to her.

Mrs. Toensing and Gilmer's mom posed for a photo after the ceremony.

""You don't just teach young people. You inspire them, and you propel them along a path of fulfillment and service to others. Your work is what makes our work possible,"" Dean Williams said.

This came to a surprise to Toensing, who felt ""shocked, flabbergasted, humbled"" when she received the invitation from Harvard, which was personally delivered to her by Gilmer.

""I have high expectations of all my students, so to hear that Christin had achieved this goal did not surprise me in the least,"" Toensing told CNN. ""I feel honored that Harvard chose to tell Christin's story, her journey, and that I was a small part of that journey,"" she added.

Christin Gilmer received her doctor of public health degree on May 23, 2018.

Gilmer who got her master's degree in public health at Columbia University, says that Toensing always encouraged her students to think of ways to help others.

""She lit a fire in me that helping people is a powerful tool, and through education, you can better serve populations in need. I will never forget her passion for others,"" Gilmer told CNN.

As a student in Toensing's class, she and others wrote a 100-page advertisement, interviewed the mayor and envisioned how recycling could work in their town 15 years before it actually happened, and helping others is something she plans to focus on.

""I would love return to southern Arizona to work in health, politics, and community development,"" Gilmer said. ""I wanted to learn from the best institutions in the world so that I could bring back the knowledge and skills I have obtained and share them with the communities from which I came.""

Toensing, who says this experience revitalized and energized her to become a better teacher for her students, praised all the hard work Gilmer has done and believes this is just the beginning of a great future.

""She has many more miles to go, I know with her tenacity, her dedication, and her passion for helping humanity, she will be highly successful and that we will all be the better for knowing her,"" Toensing said.

Hawaii Seems Poised To Ban Coral-Damaging Sunscreen - Honolulu Civil Beat,Hawaii Seems Poised To Ban Coral-Damaging Sunscreen: It would be the first state to prohibit the use of sunscreen containing ingredients that scientists say harm sea life.,1.0,"Environmental groups and lawmakers gathered Wednesday at the Capitol in support of a bill to ban coral-damaging sunscreens.

Senate Bill 2571 would prohibit the sale of sunscreen with oxybenzone and octinoxate without a prescription. Although coral bleaching is mainly caused by the warming of ocean temperatures and increased ocean acidification, research shows the chemicals can also bleach corals and inhibit the growth of sea life.

The bill is headed next to conference committee, where representatives from both chambers will try to hammer out differences in the versions that have been approved.

Nathan Eagle/Civil Beat

Samples of eco-friendly sunscreen were handed out. The stage was decorated with buckets of reef-toxic sunscreen that a group of Kaiser High School students took from Hanauma Bay visitors in exchange for reef-safe sunscreen.

More than half of Hawaii Island’s coral is bleached, said Elyssa Farmer of the Maui Ocean Center. The same is true for more than 40 percent of West Maui corals and 30 percent of those on Oahu. Fish, seaweed and other food sources have been contaminated with sunscreen chemicals, she said.

Correction: An earlier version of this story misquoted Farmer as saying that half of the state’s coral is bleached.

On Maui alone, it’s estimated that 55 gallons of sunscreen are dumped into the water every day. No sunscreen is good for reefs, but some ingredients are worse than others, said Craig Downs, a scientist who tested water samples at Hanauma Bay.

His test results indicated sunscreen levels were high in the bay, “very close to the point of no return,” he said. Dead reefs could degrade to rubble and sand. Hawaii’s reputation as a tourism destination could be marred without sea life and reefs, he said.

“The weather’s great in California, too,” Downs said. “Hawaii has a lot to lose.”

Sen. Mike Gabbard, equipped with a guitar and harmonica, was on hand to sing a brief song about banning oxybenzone. Gabbard introduced SB 2571.

Despite pushback from the cosmetic industry and dermatologists, Sen. Will Espero said Hawaii is poised to make history as the first state to ban sunscreen with hazardous chemicals.

Rep. Nicole Lowen, who has previously introduced similar legislation, said a fifth of the world’s coral is dead. Ninety percent of reefs could be dead in 30 years, she said.

Lowen said her district, west Hawaii Island, once had the healthiest and most vibrant reefs in the state. The difference is palpable since the world’s last major bleaching event a few years ago.

“We have to do everything we can to prevent this from happening,” she said.

Rep. Gene Ward, a member of the House conference committee, warned participants to be wary of any last-minute changes to the bill. He compared the month of April in the legislative session to the Bermuda triangle.

“Be alert, be sober,” he said. “It ain’t over yet.”

"New treatment may help slow progression of ALS, research shows",Promising new ALS treatment funded by Ice Bucket Challenge donations shows significant slowing in phase 2 trial,1.0,"An experimental medication may slow the progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, researchers reported Wednesday. The research was supported in part by donations from the Ice Bucket Challenge, the social media sensation that raised more than $200 million worldwide.

The drug is not a cure, but it may help slow the inexorable disability caused by ALS, which rapidly destroys the nerve cells that control the muscles that allow us to move, speak, eat and even breathe.

""Patients keep telling me their No. 1 goal is to be able to retain physical function for as long as possible,"" said the study's lead author, Dr. Sabrina Paganoni, a neuromuscular specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital's Sean M. Healey & AMG Center for ALS. ""They want to be able to continue to walk and to use their hands.""

About 20,000 people in the U.S. have ALS at any given time, according to the ALS Association. It usually strikes between the ages of 40 and 70. Once symptoms set in, life expectancy is two to six years, on average.

The treatment studied by Paganoni and her colleagues targets two cellular structures damaged by the disease: the mitochondria, which are the cells' power plants, and the endoplasmic reticulum, the cellular dump trucks that cart away waste that can gunk up the cells' machinery.

The multicenter, randomized, double-blind study is the second step — a phase 2 trial — in a three-step process required by the Food and Drug Administration for drug approval. In a double-blind study, neither the patients nor the researchers know who is receiving the drug. If a phase 2 study generates positive results, the FDA typically requires a larger and longer phase 3 trial.

To test the effectiveness of the two-drug combination, the researchers recruited 137 ALS patients who had become symptomatic within the previous 18 months. About two-thirds of the patients (89) received the drug, while the remaining third were given a placebo.

Participants were evaluated on a scale of 0 to 48, measuring the disabilities caused by the disease.

""By the time they entered the trial, on average, patients had already lost 12 points. Their baseline score was about 36, on average,"" Paganoni said. ""Each question addresses a specific domain of function and is scored on a scale from zero to four.""

For example, for walking:

4 = Normal

3 = Early ambulation difficulties

2 = Walks with assistance

1 = Nonambulatory functional movement only

0 = No purposeful leg movement

During the six months of the study, patients taking the medication lost an average of 2.32 points less than those receiving placebos, a 25 percent better functional outcome.

""A 2- to 3-point change can mean the difference between being able to do an activity independently or with an assistance device,"" Paganoni said.

The trial did not show a difference between medication and placebo in outcomes such as time to death, tracheostomy, or permanent intubation, or hospitalization. But that may be because it ran for just six months.

Paganoni suspects that, if it is approved, the new drug would be just one part of a cocktail of medications that would help to keep ALS at bay.

Because the trial showed that the medication might make a difference, all participants were offered the opportunity to stay on it or, in the cases of those who were given placebos, to start on it. The Mass General researchers will track how the patients taking the medication do in the long term.

Paganoni credited the Ice Bucket Challenge for getting her study and others going.

""The Ice Bucket Challenge was an important turning point in the fight against ALS,"" she said. ""It put ALS on the map and raised awareness of the disease and attracted more investigators and investment to the research.""

With the good news from the trial, the ALS Association hopes to persuade the FDA to allow other patients to have access to the drug, even before phase 3 trial results are available.

""It's very unusual for an ALS clinical trial to hit its primary endpoint, so we're very excited about it,"" said Neil Thakur, chief mission officer for the ALS Association. ""It's the difference between being able to feed oneself versus being fed or needing versus not needing a wheelchair.""

ALS experts cautioned against rushing ahead without more data.

""The current data are definitely positive, but they need to be replicated,"" said Dr. Martina Wiedau-Pazos, a neurologist who is director of the ALS Clinic and Research Center at UCLA. ""This study has limitations, such as being small and lasting just six months. I think a phase 3 trial is needed, because, in the past, positive outcomes from phase 2 trials were not confirmed in phase 3 trials.""

Another issue is that the study included subjects who had more rapid disease progression than normal, said Dr. David Lacomis, chief of the neuromuscular division at UPMC in Pittsburgh. ""So it's unclear what the effects would be in the broader ALS population,"" Lacomis said via email.

While the new findings are promising, they are not ""earth shattering,"" said Dr. Erik Pioro, director of the section of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and related disorders at the Cleveland Clinic. ""But it does add credence to the idea that other pathways are playing significant roles in ALS pathogenesis.""

Results of the trial were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Four boys who went missing for more than a day during a blizzard in rural Alaska were found alive on Monday, and were resourceful when it came to protecting the youngest and most vulnerable to the elements.The children, who range in age from 2 to 14, were found about 20 miles outside the village of Nunam Iqua, on Alaska's west coast, a representative with Emmonak Search and Rescue told CNN by phone Monday night.""The kids are doing fine,"" the representative said. ""I talked to the grandpa. They were cold and hungry.""The boys reportedly huddled around the youngest boy.They dug a foot-deep hole in the snow and huddled themselves inside and positioned themselves in a way so that the 2-year-old wouldn't be as exposed, according to Alaska Public Media.“They were protecting the baby,” rescuer Herschel Sundown told the news outlet.When asked how the children got so far from their village during the blizzard, the official noted, ""In winter time our storms are very bad. Sense of direction is not to be played with.""Alaska State Troopers received a report Sunday at 6:25 p.m. local time that the children hadn't returned from a snow-machine ride near the remote, rural village of Nunam Iqua.Officials were called after the boys were more than five hours late in returning home.""At least three were appropriately dressed for the weather,"" said state patrol spokesperson Megan Peters at the time of the search. ""There's concern for their safety.""There were winter storm warnings in effect throughout the region at the time state troopers were alerted, CNN meteorologist Michael Guy said.The National Weather Service warned of wind gusts as high as 60 mph, and wind chills as low as 45 below zero, which can ""cause frostbite in as little as 10 minutes to exposed skin,"" the NWS said in its Sunday afternoon advisory.The four children were identified as Christopher Johnson, 14, Frank Johnson, 8, Ethan Camille, 7, and Trey Camille, 2.Army National Guard and USCG helicopters were called in Sunday to assist, but blizzard conditions hampered visibility.

A family in Greenwood thought their dog was gone forever, until they got a call from a woman 70 miles away in Greenville, a year after they were told the pit bull was dead.Esther Atkins, of Greenville, who happens to be a world-class marathon runner, posted on social media that she took her dog, Grace, for a morning walk Thursday in the Skyland Park of Nicholtown. Atkins said a brown and white pit bull followed them home, and even though Grace was not friendly to him, the pit bull kept being sweet and wagging his tail. Atkins took the pit bull in and posted pictures and information online. Then she took him to a vet, where they learned he was microchipped. The Humane Society of Greenwood help identify the owner, who had reported him missing a year ago. The owner said reporting him missing was just wishful thinking at the time, because one of her neighbors had told her that he killed the dog, named Rachet. Atkins shared pictures with Rachet’s owner, who said her young daughter started to cry when she saw him. “You really don’t know how much this means to my kids and me,” Rachet’s owner said. Rachet napped at Atkins’ home, having no idea what was going to happen on Friday. On Friday afternoon, Rachet was in a privacy-fenced area, and he began sniffing the air and wagging his tail as his owner approached. When he heard his owner’s voice, he began wagging his tail, jumping and whining joyfully. Their theory is that the neighbor who said he killed Rachet actually sold him to someone in Greenville, but it’s likely the details of Rachet’s missing year will never be known. On Friday afternoon, Rachet was back home in Greenwood with the family that once thought they’d never see him again, thanks to a dog lover who didn’t judge a pit bull by his cover and let him come home with her.",https://www.wyff4.com/article/dog-believed-killed-by-neighbor-turns-up-in-greenville-year-later-68-miles-from-home/22641246
Here’s who to thank that we all survived the quake on Friday,"Thanks to better science and engineering, no one died in Friday's 7.0 earthquake in Anchorage, Alaska",1.0,"For the second time in 54 years, an earthquake damaged roads and buildings across Anchorage and shook people in a way few will ever forget.

The 1964 Good Friday earthquake and the quake Friday had many differences, starting with the wonderful fact that no one died this time (131 died in the ’64 quake). The geological differences are interesting and important too.

But one thing is the same. Like every big earthquake, they taught us who is really in charge. To the extent we listen to that lesson, we can protect ourselves and those who come after us.

That’s important, because we can be sure this wasn’t Anchorage’s last big earthquake. Indeed, 7.0 magnitude quakes are expected regularly on the Alaska-Aleutian Subduction Zone. The nearby location made the shaking so severe in Anchorage. Our number came up and it will again.

I don’t want to minimize what happened. It was big.

1 of 17 Full Screen Full Screen Autoplay Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Caption Buy This Photo Vine Road, south of Wasilla, was heavily damaged by an earthquake on November 30, 2018. (Marc Lester / ADN) Wait 1 second to continue.

The damage will be expensive. That begins with precious things that were broken. Survivors often say — as they should — that those are only material things, not comparable to the value of our safety in coming through without deaths or many serious injuries.

But irreplaceable things that are lost do count. It’s natural to grieve over a grandmother’s china or a now-grown child’s smashed artwork.

The financial expense will be significant too, and we’re only starting to understand that.

Roads, bridges and schools will be repaired with government funds, including emergency reserves and federal assistance. The rush of relief funds after the ’64 quake, which brought so much more damage, saved Alaska from an economic slump. We can use the construction jobs these days too.

For homeowners, the hit may be worse, even if the numbers are smaller. Damaged foundations and chimneys can be extremely expensive to repair. Many Alaskans don’t have earthquake insurance, and for those who do, deductibles are high.

Even though you dread looking, it’s worth locating that damage now. Having a home inspector find it a few years from now, when you are trying to sell your house, could compound the financial hit.

All that said, the impact of this earthquake is nothing like that of the quake 54 years ago, which released almost 2,000 times more energy. (It was a magnitude 9.2 quake, compared to magnitude 7 this time; the scale is logarithmic.)

The ’64 quake relocated a block of the Earth’s crust carrying Prince William Sound and the Kenai Peninsula, an area 600 miles by 250 miles. The west side, near Seldovia, sank into the ocean, while the east side, at Montague Island, rose as much as 38 feet.

The rupture lasted more than 4 minutes, and the shaking people felt went on longer. After what happened Friday, you can understand how in ’64, some started believing the shaking would never stop — they thought the world was ending.

The ’64 quake liquefied soil under West Anchorage called Bootlegger Cove clay. It’s too soon to make firm statements about Friday’s quake, but records from ‘64 say the clay didn’t collapse until well into the shaking. This quake may not have lasted long enough for that to happen.

When the clay liquefied in ’64, buildings large and small went down. In the Turnagain area, houses slid into the sea. Downtown, Fourth Avenue split down the middle, with businesses on the north side going down the hill. In Government Hill, a school broke in half and fell into a hole.

“The motion in 1964 was very, very different,” said Mike West, Alaska’s state seismologist. “Not only did it last a long time, but it was also more like rolling waves on the ocean rather than a vigorous shake.”

The ’64 quake was extremely rare — one of only a few in the world ever recorded that strong — and not expected to return for perhaps 500 years.

Afterward, a debate raged for a decade about how to prepare for another earthquake. A group of scientists and planners wanted to make the Turnagain area into a park and stop development along the L Street bluff, which also sits on Bootlegger Cove clay.

But some town leaders feared Anchorage would die if land was condemned. The city was less than 50 years old. Some residents did leave the week after the quake, turning in their house keys to their lenders. And condemning the land would hurt some of the city’s most powerful property owners.

Instead, the city adopted plans to limit building height, concentrate tall buildings on firmer ground in the core of downtown instead of its periphery (that’s why the Atwood and ConocoPhillips buildings are on Seventh Avenue) and to adopt tough codes for areas expected to have unsteady ground.

An unsung cadre of engineers has protected us since, reviewing plans and objecting when the danger is too high. They have been overruled at times, and Anchorage has a few buildings that geotechnical engineers do not approve of. But Friday’s lack of deaths and low number of serious injuries speaks to their success.

A magnitude 6.9 earthquake in August killed 460 people in Indonesia and displaced 350,000. In August of 2016, a 6.0 quake killed 298 people in central Italy.

I would not blame anyone for those deaths. Many variables make those places different from Alaska.

But it is worth noting that, as Alaskans, we just survived something that easily could have killed many of us. And we should learn from that.

The debate is not over. Endless meetings have weighed whether projects should go ahead when the experts have doubts. Cautious voices always face the excitement of jobs and economic growth.

The next time you hear about a developer who wants to build on view property along Cook Inlet — on Bootlegger Cove clay — think about that jolt you felt Friday morning. When a proposal comes forward to break the height limit or bend the geotechnical rules, remember who kept us safe Friday.

It was the engineers and scientists. They were the heroes who saved countless lives on Friday.

Adult recipient of stem cell transplant in Calgary cured of sickle-cell disease,Adult recipient of stem cell transplant in Calgary cured of sickle-cell disease,1.0,"An Edmonton woman who received donor stem cells from her sister during a procedure in Calgary last year has been declared cured of her sickle-cell disease and health officials believe Revée Agyepong is the first adult in Canada to be cured of the disease through this method.

Sickle-cell disease causes red blood cells to become misshapen and leads to the clogging of small blood vessels. The disruption can result in bone deterioration and organ failure.

“People with sickle-cell disease will often survive into their 40s or 50s,” explained Agyepong.

Stem cell transplant procedures had been used to treat children with the disease but doctors feared the complications could do more harm than good on adult patients.

Agyepong and her sister, Stephanie Amoah, advocated for a transplant and, once it was confirmed the sisters were a perfect match and Amoah was free of the disease, doctors agreed to the surgical procedure.

“I was just excited to know we would get the HLA testing which is the compatibility testing,” recalled Agyepong. “We hoped for the best, crossed our fingers, and then, on her birthday – which is crazy, we got the best news ever; that she was a ten-out-of-ten match.”

In November of 2017, Agyepong underwent a complicated and risky stem cell transplant at the Tom Baker Cancer Centre under the direction of Dr. Andrew Daly, who leads Alberta’s bone marrow transplant program.

“When Revée approached us, we had coincidentally been thinking about adult stem cell transplant for sickle-cell disease based on the remarkably good outcomes that Alberta Children’s Hospital has been seeing with transplants in the pediatric population,” explained Dr. Daly in a released statement. “She met all the necessary criteria in terms of being able to tolerate a transplant but, most important, she had a sibling who was a 100 per cent match.”

The procedure proved successful but there are concerns as her immune system will remain compromised as a result of the anti-rejection drugs. The side-effects are expected to persist for another year.

On Tuesday, blood tests confirmed the 26-year-old was sickle-cell disease free.

""Over the past few months, what we've seen is that Revée's sister's bone marrow has taken over the production of Revée's red blood cells,"" said Dr. Daly. ""The amount of sickle-cell hemoglobin in her bloodstream has decreased almost to zero.""

“I can see the light at the end of the tunnel,” said Agyepong. “I’m not feeling as much pain. I’m not exhausted. So I’m excited for that.”

Agyepong is optimistic and excited by the idea that the success of her stem cell transplant could result in additional sickle-cell disease patients being offered the treatment.

"No cow slaughtering in Pakistan’s border district, not under compulsion but respect","Muslims in Pakistani town refuse to slaughter cows ""to avoid hurting the feelings of their Hindu fellows""",1.0,"KARACHI: Tharo Khan, a resident of Islamkot town of Tharparkar, bought a goat for sacrifice on Eidul Adha. This cost him Rs. 18,000 ($146). He could get a share in a cow which would cost him less than Rs. 6,000 ($49) but he opted for goat. The reason is not “affordability” but “respect for the fellow citizens practicing another faith.”

“Sacrifice (slaughtering animal) is a religious obligation which I have to fulfil. However, at the same time I have a social obligation to take care of the sentiments of my Hindu friends, who make up 90 percent of our town,” Khan told Arab News.

While the slaughtering of cows and subsequent lynching of Muslims who are the minority faith in India often makes headlines, in the Pakistani border district of Tharparkar the majority of Muslims opt to not slaughter cows to avoid hurting the feelings of their Hindu fellows.

Tharparkar, situated at the India-Pakistan border, has the lowest Human Development Index of all the districts in Sindh. It has a 1,649,661 population (1.6 million), as per census of 2017. Of these 1.6 million, well over 40 percent are Hindus.

However, in urban areas, including its headquarter Mithi and Tehsil towns of Diplo, Islamkot, Chachro, Dahli, Nagarparkar and Kaloi, Hindus forms majority of the population. In Islamkot Hindus are more than 90 percent.

“We are faced with drought and have the lowest human development index but we are rich in terms of love, respect and brotherhood,” Kaldeep Kumar, 40, and president of the Islamkot traders’ association, told Arab News.

Kumar on Wednesday visited his Muslim friends to greet them at Eid; he ate sweets and grilled mutton, since his Muslim friends like other Tharis don’t slaughter the cow.

“Hindus of Thar arrange Iftar dinners for the Muslim friends in the fasting month of Ramadan. They (Muslims) attend our religious rituals and festivals,” said Kumar.

“Although not prohibited by law, there is an unannounced ban on the slaughter of cow, which is sacred to Hindus. This ban is however not forced but self-imposed and reflects the centuries-old interfaith harmony,” said Abdul Ghani Bajeer, a local journalist.

“This is not confined to Eid. You can’t find a single of a dozen of meat shops across the district which may be offering cow’s meat to its customers,” Bajeer told Arab News. “In the Muslim weddings, serving food of cow meat is being avoided as many Hindus also attend the wedding ceremonies.”

At Eid, the locals chose to slaughter goats but in some cases if they slaughter a cow, it’s done away from the eyes of Hindu fellow citizens out of respect for their religious feelings.

Bajeer said that over the past few years, different welfare organizations including Al-Khidmat Foundation, Human Relief Foundation, Darul Uloom Karachi, Al-Mustafa Trust, have started arranging sacrifices for the underprivileged local Muslim communities. “But local volunteers make sure that slaughtering process is being done in closed spaces and the meat doesn’t reach the Hindus,” he said.

Piaro Shawani, the 40-year-old Hindu owner of Café Thar in Mithi, said that Tharparkar is backward in resources but is wealthiest due to its interfaith harmony, brotherhood, respect and love. “In the rainy season, we celebrate the rain related festival together. We also attend each other’s religious festivals,” he said.

Abdul Rehman Otho, the 45-year-old principal of a private school in Diplo town of Thar, said that there is no prohibition on slaughtering cow. “No Hindu can stop us from slaughtering (the cow) but we have inherited this legacy of not hurting the feelings of our fellow Hindus from our forefathers,” Otho told Arab News. “Hindu-Muslim women are even more attached to each other.”

Advocate Faqir Sagir, general secretary of the Mithi Bar Association, said: “This interfaith harmony leads to a tolerant society where the crime rate is low. We have a zero crime ratio.”

Ghansham Das, the 60-year-old former chairman of Islamkot City union council, said: “If we are not asked by someone about it we even don’t remember about cow slaughtering.”

In our area, people of two different faiths live together but this is a blessing for us not a curse, unlike what we see in many places around the world. “We are not only an example for the rest of our country but for the entire world. We participate in their festivals and they (Muslims) in ours.”

Amar Guriro, who has reported about Thar Desert extensively, said that Thar Desert is a hub of religious coexistence and interfaith harmony. “People of Sindh are emotionally attached to their motherland, language and culture, more than their religion. For Sindhi people, one’s religion or faith is not important but someone who loves their motherland, speaks their language, and practices Sindhi culture is important,” Guriro said.

“The Muslim majority has always taken care of our sentiments so other countries, especially our neighboring India, should take a lesson from it as well,” Kaldeep Kumar said.",http://www.arabnews.pk/node/1360936/world
"Lifeguard, 15, saves toddler during first day on the job","Lifeguard, 15, saves toddler during first day on the job",1.0,"This is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated. Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.

LAKEWOOD, Ohio — It started out as a day of fun in the sun at the Charles A. Foster pool in Lakewood, Ohio last Thursday – but things quickly turned dangerous.

Lifeguard Jack Viglianco, 15, told WJW, “I heard like a ‘Help, ah,’ kind of thing. And I looked over and I saw a guy who’s probably like 3 feet 6 inches, in the 4-foot water and gasping for air.”

The victim was a 4-year-old boy at the pool for a summer camp field trip.

Viglianco said the young boy was bobbing up and down, screaming for help.

Not only was it Jack’s first day on the job, it was only 20 minutes into his shift, when he had to put the lifesaving skills he had just learned to the test.

“Active drowners can still breathe, and they’re still above water, but they are still in the act of drowning,” said Viglianco.

Lakewood aquatics manager Matt Demaline said, “Jack activated our emergency response plan. He got down off the chair and jumped in and helped the kid to safety. He had just completed … a five-hour orientation the day before for all of our new and returning staff and we were ready to go, day one.”

Lakewood’s aquatics department says the scary scene proved to be the perfect reminder to parents and caregivers about safety at the pool … knowing things can drastically take a turn for the worse in the blink of an eye.

“Never let them out of your sight,” said grandmother Eileen McCray. “That’s what I do with her, no matter where we’re at or where we go, she can’t go where I can’t see her.”

As for Jack Viglianco, he says being a lifeguard is a passion and dream come true. His first day on the job, he says, is one he’ll never forget.

“I was realizing that I just saved a kid’s life. And that is something not many other people can say. Nothing my friends have ever said.”

Between Lakewood’s two public pools, WJW reports there were 42 lifesaving efforts in just the last two summers. All victims were saved, thanks to the well-trained lifeguards on duty.

"Singapore abolishes school exam rankings, says learning is not competition","Singapore abolishes school exam rankings, says learning is not competition",1.0,"Whether a child finishes first or last will no longer be indicated in primary and secondary school report books from next year in Singapore, – a move which Education Minister Ong Ye Kung hopes will show students that “learning is not a competition”.

Report books will not just stop showing a student’s position in relation to class or cohort. The information to be dropped includes:

Class and level mean

Minimum and maximum marks

Underlining and/or colouring of failing marks

Pass/fail for end-of-year result

Mean subject grades

Overall total marks

L1R5 (English plus five relevant subjects), L1R4 , EMB3 (English, maths, best three subjects) and EMB1 for lower secondary levels

The Ministry of Education (MOE) said on Friday (Sept 28) that the change is to allow each student to focus on his or her learning progress and discourage them from being overly concerned about comparisons.

From next year all examinations for Primary 1 and 2 pupils will also be removed, and whatever forms of assessment they have will not count towards an overall grade.

The MOE said that teachers will continue to gather information about pupils’ learning through discussions, homework and quizzes. Schools will use other ways like “qualitative descriptors”, in place of marks and grades, to evaluate pupils’ progress at these two levels.

For older students in primary schools and secondary schools, marks for each subject will be rounded off and presented as a whole number, without decimal points – to reduce the focus on academic scores. Parents will continue to receive information about their child’s progress in school during parent-teacher meetings.

In an address to some 1,700 school leaders earlier this week, Mr Ong said: “I know that ‘coming in first or second’, in class or level, has traditionally been a proud recognition of a student’s achievement. But removing these indicators is for a good reason, so that the child understands from young that learning is not a competition, but a self-discipline they need to master for life.

“Notwithstanding, the report book should still contain some form of yardstick and information to allow students to judge their relative performance, and evaluate their strengths and weaknesses.”

So biologists couldn't believe their eyes when not one, but four San Quintin kangaroo rats (Dipodomys gravipes) hopped into their survey traps in 2017.

Named for their ability to leap like kangaroos, the rats are key species in arid areas across western North America, dispersing seeds and feeding predators such as coyotes and foxes. The San Quintin kangaroo rat is about 12 centimeters long, with a long, tufted tail and enormous hind legs that allow it to leap about 2 meters and speed away at 10 kilometers per hour. They once lived by the thousands in a narrow coastal valley stretching 150 kilometers along the Pacific coast of northern Baja California.

But their numbers began to dwindle with the introduction of intensive agriculture in the 1970s, after which their habitat and food disappeared. Then, just 9 months ago, a team of researchers doing a routine inventory of mammals in the region discovered the rats in their survey traps. None of them had ever seen the species before, so they had to compare it with museum specimens and photographs, they will report in an upcoming issue of the Bulletin of the Southern California Academy of Sciences .

The researchers attribute the kangaroo rat's comeback to a dramatic decrease in farming over the past decade, thanks to drought-related water shortages. Although the researchers are concerned that farmers may eventually make their own comeback, they are optimistic that the San Quintin kangaroo rat will persist, as it has also shown up in a nearby nature reserve. They say it also offers hope for other ""extinct"" small mammals, which may be findable if only researchers take the time and effort to track them down.",http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/04/supposedly-extinct-kangaroo-rat-resurfaces-after-30-years
Holocaust hero: US soldier told Nazi captors 'We are all Jews',"Holocaust hero: US soldier told Nazi captors 'We are all Jews' — To protect Jewish captives at a Nazi POW camp, US Master Sgt. Roddie Edmonds ordered more than 1,000 Americans captives to step forward with him and pronounced: ""We are all Jews here.""",1.0,"The Nazi soldiers made their orders very clear: Jewish American prisoners of war were to be separated from their fellow brothers in arms and sent to an uncertain fate.

But Master Sgt. Roddie Edmonds would have none of that. As the highest-ranking noncommissioned officer held in the German POW camp, he ordered more than 1,000 Americans captives to step forward with him and brazenly pronounced: ""We are all Jews here.""

He would not waver, even with a pistol to his head, and his captors eventually backed down.

Seventy years later, the Knoxville, Tennessee, native is being posthumously recognized with Israel's highest honor for non-Jews who risked their lives to save Jews during World War II. He's the first American serviceman to earn the honor.

""Master Sgt. Roddie Edmonds seemed like an ordinary American soldier, but he had an extraordinary sense of responsibility and dedication to his fellow human beings,"" said Avner Shalev, chairman of the Yad Vashem Holocaust museum and memorial. ""The choices and actions of Master Sgt. Edmonds set an example for his fellow American soldiers as they stood united against the barbaric evil of the Nazis.""

It's a story that remained untold for decades and one that his son, the Rev. Chris Edmonds, only discovered long after his father's death in 1985.

Edmonds was captured with thousands of others in the Battle of the Bulge in late 1944 and spent 100 days in captivity. His son vaguely knew about his father's past from a pair of diaries Edmonds kept in captivity that included the names and addresses of his men and some of his daily thoughts.

But it was only while scouring the Internet a few years ago that he began to unravel the true drama that had unfolded — oddly enough, when he read a newspaper article about Richard Nixon's post-presidency search for a New York home. As it happened, Nixon purchased his exclusive upper East Side town house from Lester Tanner, a prominent New York lawyer who mentioned in passing how Edmonds had saved him and dozens of other Jews during the war.

The New York Times reported in 2008:

As a G.I. in World War II, Mr. Tanner had been taken prisoner by the Germans and was being held in the Ziegenhein stalag in January 1945, when the Nazi commandant demanded at gunpoint to know which of the American soldiers were Jews. As. Mr. Tanner recalled it, their brave officer, Master Sgt. Roddie Edmonds, defied the camp commander, saying the Geneva Convention forbade the request, and Mr. Tanner and his fellow prisoners were spared, to be liberated shortly afterward.

That sparked a search for Tanner, who along with another Jewish POW, Paul Stern, told the younger Edmonds what they witnessed on Jan. 27, 1945, at the Stalag IXA POW camp near Ziegenhain, Germany.

The Wehrmacht had a strict anti-Jew policy and segregated Jewish POWs from non-Jews. On the eastern front, captured Jewish soldiers in the Russian army had been sent to extermination camps.

At the time of Edmonds' capture, the most infamous Nazi death camps were no longer fully operational, so Jewish American POWs were instead sent to slave labor camps where their chances of survival were low. U.S. soldiers had been warned that Jewish fighters among them would be in danger if captured and were told to destroy dog tags or any other evidence identifying them as Jewish.

So when the German camp commander, speaking in English, ordered the Jews to identify themselves, Edmonds knew what was at stake.

Turning to the rest of the POWs, he said: ""We are not doing that, we are all falling out,"" recalled Chris Edmonds, who is currently in Israel participating in a seminar for Christian leaders at Yad Vashem's International School for Holocaust Studies.

With all the camp's inmates defiantly standing in front of their barracks, the German commander turned to Edmonds and said: ""They cannot all be Jews."" To which Edmonds replied: ""We are all Jews here.""

Then the Nazi officer pressed his pistol to Edmonds head and offered him one last chance. Edmonds merely gave him his name, rank and serial number as required by the Geneva Conventions.

""And then my dad said: 'If you are going to shoot, you are going to have to shoot all of us because we know who you are and you'll be tried for war crimes when we win this war,'"" recalled Chris Edmonds, who estimates his father's actions saved the lives of more than 200 Jewish-American soldiers.

Witnesses to the exchange said the German officer then withdrew. Stern, who currently lives in Reston, Virginia, told Yad Vashem that even 70 years later he can ""still hear the words.""

About 6 million European Jews were killed by German Nazis and their collaborators during World War II. The names of those honored for risking their lives to protect Jews are engraved along an avenue of trees at the Jerusalem memorial.

More than 26,000 have been designated ""Righteous Among the Nations,"" the most famous being Oskar Schindler, whose efforts to save more than 1,000 Jews were documented in Steven Spielberg's 1993 film ""Schindler's List,"" and Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat who is credited for having saved at least 20,000 Jews before mysteriously disappearing.

But prior to Edmonds, only four were Americans, who belonged to the clergy or volunteered for rescue groups. He's the first serviceman and the first whose actions saved the lives of fellow Americans. A ceremony for Edmonds is planned next year. And, thanks to his son's efforts, Edmonds is now also being considered for a Congressional Medal of Honor.

Irena Steinfeldt, the director of the Holocaust memorial's Righteous Among the Nations department, said all rescue stories were unique. She said Edmonds actions were reflective of those of a military man, who was prepared to take a quick, clear, moral decision.

""It's a matter of five minutes and that is it. When he tells the German, 'No,' that is something that can kill him,"" she explained. ""It is something very dangerous that is happening in one moment. ... But it is very heroic.""

Chris Edmonds, who leads a Baptist congregation in Maryville, Tennessee, said he believed his father had a ""deep moral conviction"" instilled in his faith that inspired his actions.

""All he had to fight with was his will power and his wits,"" he said. ""I'm just glad he did the right thing.""

LA County DA To Dismiss Nearly 66K Marijuana Convictions,LA County DA To Dismiss Nearly 66K Marijuana Convictions,1.0,"LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) – In a sweeping move, Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey announced that her office has asked the court to dismiss nearly 66,000 marijuana convictions going back decades.

In a news conference Thursday morning, Lacey called it the largest such undertaking in state history.

“We believe it is the largest effort in California to wipe out old criminal convictions in a single court motion,” Lacey said.

Lacey said that when Proposition 64 passed in 2016 – which legalized marijuana in California — prosecutors across the state were tasked with reducing past marijuana convictions from felonies down to misdemeanors. However, she says her office decided to go even further.

“I’ve instructed by deputy district attorneys to ask the court to dismiss all eligible cannabis-related convictions,” Lacey said. “I also took the will of the voters one step further. I expanded the criteria to go above and beyond the parameters of the law to ensure that many more people will benefit from this historic moment in time.”

Those eligible include anyone 50 years of age or older, anyone who has not been convicted of a crime in the last 10 years, anyone with a conviction who successfully completed probation and anyone with a conviction under the age of 21.

“As a result of our actions these convictions should no longer burden those who have struggled to find a job or a place to live because of their criminal record,” Lacey said.

Of the total, about 62,000 were felony cannabis convictions and 3,700 were misdemeanor possession convictions, some of which had been separately prosecuted by 10 different cities in L.A. County, including Burbank, Pasadena, Inglewood, Santa Monica and Torrance.

The motion, which was filed Tuesday, also calls for the court to seal the convictions.

“If you have a record, you don’t have to worry about even going through and having it sealed…We’re making a motion to seal it because we realize that’s the issue,” Lacey said. “When you go to apply for a job, you go to apply for housing and you’re record comes up, even though we’ve expunged it,that may not give you help.”

The move comes just three weeks before the March 3 Primary Election where Lacey is in a heated fight to keep her position. Her seat is being challenged by George Gascon, the former San Francisco DA, along with Rachel Rossie, a former federal public defender. Lacey is hoping for a third term.

Lacey said the sheer volume of the undertaking has created major challenges for prosecutors, with some of the cases going back to 1961. The county worked with the nonprofit group Code for America to create an algorithm to find all the eligible convictions.

“It had to do with developing an algorithm and developing our criteria, we wanted to go above and beyond what Prop 64 required,” Lacey said. “In working with Code For America, it took some time for them to develop a particular algorithm, find the right type of computer system to plug them in. In addition we wanted to go further and capture the misdemeanors.”

Following the passage of Prop 64, in October of 2018 then-Gov. Jerry Brown signed Assembly Bill 1793, which required the California Department of Justice to review its records for all cannabis convictions that are eligible to be expunged or reduced. That information was then passed on to all county prosecutors, who have until July 1, 2020, to review those cases and decide whether to challenge them.

People who want to know if there case are being cleared can contact the L.A. County Public Defender’s Office, where a hotline has been established at 323-760-6763.",https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2020/02/13/la-county-da-to-dismiss-nearly-66k-marijuana-convictions/
Bees Love Cannabis And It Could Help Restore Bee Populations,Bees Love Cannabis And It Could Help Restore Bee Populations,1.0,"According to a new study, bees are fans of hemp. Taller hemp plants, it seems, attracts bee populations to it in droves.

According to a new study, bees are fans of hemp. Taller hemp plants, it seems, attracts bee populations to it in droves.

The latest research, conducted by Cornell University researchers, was published in Environmental Entomology. The findings reinforce findings from a previous study published at Colorado State University, that bees are highly attracted to cannabis because of the plant’s plentiful amounts of pollen.

The finding could pave the way for future research that might uncover new ways to prop up the struggling bee populations of no less than 16 different varieties along the north-eastern United States. The study also found that the tallest hemp plants attract 17 times more bees than the shorter ones.

The findings are unusual. Cannabis doesn’t produce the sweet nectar found in typical floral varieties that attract insects. The bright colours that often attract bees and other insects to other plants are also less dazzling compared to other flower species, compounding the unique finding.

Loading...

The author of the study explains the significant implications of these findings as having a crucial impact on declining bee populations in the United States.

“The rapid expansion of hemp production in the United States… may have significant implications for agroecosystem-wide pollination dynamics.

As a late-season crop flowering during a period of seasonal floral dearth, hemp may have a particularly strong potential to enhance pollinator populations and subsequent pollination services for crops in the following year by filling gaps in late-season resource scarcity.”

Bees, a crucial pollinator across the world, are responsible for plant reproduction and play a pivotal role in our food production. Without bees, many crops would simply disappear.

The study’s authors go to lengths to explain that although bees are significantly attracted to hemp, cannabinoid-rich pollen won’t infiltrate our diets, and nor will it “have an impact on bee development due to the loss of cannabinoid receptors in insects.”",https://captain-planet.net/cannabis-could-help-restore-bee-populations/
"The End Of Root Canals: Stem Cell Fillings Trigger Teeth To Repair Themselves, Research Study Claims","The End Of Root Canals: Stem Cell Fillings Trigger Teeth To Repair Themselves, Research Study Claims",1.0,"What if damaged teeth could heal themselves without the need of a root canal? Apparently, that's what Harvard and the University of Nottingham are trying to figure out. They believe they can create stem cell stimulated fillings.

Worldwide, dentists treat hundreds of millions of cavities each year by drilling out the decayed part of the tooth and replacing it with a filling. According to Popular Science, the problem is up to 15 percent of those procedures will fail, which will lead to a root canal to remove the tooth's pulp, a soft tissue in the center of the tooth that contains blood vessels, nerves, and connective tissue. The downside is, following a root canal, the tooth's strength is weaker and could eventually need to be removed.

Adam Celiz is a therapeutic biomaterials researcher who believes that stem cells could help reduce the number of root canals and the need for dentures. Celiz and his team developed a new kind of filling that is made from stem cells that can help your tooth heal. Just like regular fillings, the biomaterial stem cells are injected into the tooth and hardened with ultra-violet light.

""Existing dental fillings are toxic to cells and are therefore incompatible with pulp tissue inside the tooth. In cases of dental pulp disease and injury, a root canal is typically performed to remove the infected tissues. We have designed synthetic biomaterials that can be used similarly to dental fillings but can be placed in direct contact with pulp tissue to stimulate the native stem cell population for repair and regeneration of pulp tissue and the surrounding dentin. 'Our approach has great promise to impact the dental field and this prize provides a great platform to develop this technology further with industrial partners.""

Celiz believes that all fillings could be made of such regenerative material so that damaged teeth could heal themselves, which, in theory, would reduce the filling failures and could completely eliminate the need for root canals.The researchers believe that if used on a damaged tooth, those stem cells can repair the tooth. It would mimic a filling but would have a very low risk of rejection or failure. The easiest way to explain it is the tooth would heal itself, with the help of the stem cell biomaterial injection.

According to Daily Mail, the research placed second in the materials category of the Royal Society of Chemistry's Emerging Technologies Competition in 2016. Applications were judged on the degree of innovation, the potential impact, and the quality of the science behind it.

Many dentists aren't sure if stem cells have a place in dentistry. They suggest additional research to prove (or disprove) its benefits.",https://www.inquisitr.com/4759240/the-end-of-root-canals-stem-cell-fillings-trigger-teeth-to-repair-themselves-research-study-claims/

New Zealand's COVID-19 'eradication' strategy looks to be paying off

Strict, early lockdown by prime minister may end coronavirus on island nation

After more than a month confined to dry land without being immersed in the salt and sea, New Zealander Zen Wallis says it feels like he's living in someone else's body.

""It's really strange to not go into the water,"" the professional surfer told CBC News in an interview by Skype. ""My skin feels different; my hair feels different.""

Surfing has been one of the casualties of New Zealand's extreme COVID-19 lockdown introduced in mid-March, one of the most stringent virus-fighting regimes anywhere in the world.

Wallis, 28, runs a surfing school in Piha on New Zealand's North Island, about 40 kilometres southwest of Auckland.

Coming at the tail end of the Southern Hemisphere's summer, his classes would normally have been full, he says, and he'd have been in water for as long as there was daylight.

""It was an interesting call to make — to actually make [surfing] criminal,"" he said.

But with the end of the prohibition on surfing and many other activities now just days away, Wallis says he feels the gains in New Zealand probably made the ban worthwhile.

""We may be able to open New Zealand back up if we can 'crush' this,"" he said of the government's stated goal of eradicating the infection.

Eradicate COVID-19

On Monday, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced that what New Zealand calls its Alert Level 4 measures — the most intense level — would last until end of day April 27, after which the country will revert to Alert Level 3, a level with greater freedoms.

""We have done what few countries have been able to do — we have stopped a wave of devastation,"" said Ardern, who has received widespread praise both at home and abroad for taking early, decisive action against COVID-19.

""The number of cases that each person with the virus passes it on to is now 0.48, less than half a person each. Overseas, the average is 2.5 people, so we have among the lowest number of confirmed cases per 100,000 people in the world.""

As of Tuesday, the country of five million people had registered 1,445 cases and just 13 deaths, most of them in nursing homes.

The majority of those infected have also now recovered.

For much of March and April, under the Alert Level 4 lockdown, only essential trips to the grocery store and pharmacies were permitted, along with brief trips outside for exercise. Swimming at the beach — and surfing — were not designated as essential activities, and related businesses closed.

Stringent measures

The measures, in place since March 25, go significantly beyond what most Canadian provinces have brought in.

In British Columbia, for example, restaurants have been serving takeout food, many public parks and beaches have remained open, organizations such as Amazon and Canada Post have been making deliveries and some retailers have been able to continue with in-store sales as long as they abide by physical distancing guidelines.

Whereas most countries have focused on ""flattening the curve"" of cases to ensure health-care systems aren't overwhelmed at the peak of infections, New Zealand's government decided early on it would go a big step further and try to wipe out COVID-19 completely.

""It's only a viable strategy if you do it early enough. It becomes harder to do it the longer you leave it,"" said Siouxsie Wiles, an infectious disease expert at the University of Auckland.

Wiles, with striking, bright pink hair and an easy way of communicating difficult concepts, has become something of a national celebrity since the beginning of the epidemic with near daily appearances on local media.

Measles outbreak

In an interview with CBC News, she said one of the key considerations for Ardern's government in adopting the strictest measures possible, was the interconnectedness the country has with many small Pacific islands that were in an extremely poor position to fight COVID-19.

""We saw last year in Samoa, when we exported measles, how absolutely devastating it was to them. They just don't have the health-care system we have.""

In 2019, the small nation in the South Pacific registered almost 6,000 cases of measles resulting in 84 deaths. Scientists believe the disease was carried there by an infected patient who arrived on an Air New Zealand flight.

After April 27, Wiles says the plan is to keep New Zealand's borders closed to international travellers and to carefully track every new COVID-19 case that turns up, seeking out and isolating anyone who had contact with the infected person.

""If your contact tracing and testing is good enough, then you can minimize outbreaks — you can find cases and stop that spread.""

While New Zealand health officials have not released the raw data on their capacity to contact trace, several independent experts brought in as consultants have agreed with the Ardern government's approach and that New Zealand is in a position to make contact tracing work.

Incomplete data

Opposition politicians, however, insist the lockdown could have ended even sooner if the government had been more forthright about its ability to monitor the spread of the virus.

""This is a real shame, as businesses will suffer further damage, and that will lead to poor health outcomes as a result of the huge stress this will cause for a lot of people,"" said opposition National Party Leader Simon Bridges.

Practically speaking, Alert Level 3 will leave New Zealanders freer than Canadians in some ways but not in others.

People will be able to extend their ""bubble,"" as health officials refer to it, by having caregivers or cleaners return to their homes, for example, as long as those workers don't also visit other homes.

Schools will open for elementary and middle school students, but the expectation is that any student who is in a position to continue with online learning from home will do so.

Industries such as construction and forestry will be allowed to resume. Restaurants will not be able to open up for table service, but takeout will be permitted.

And people will be able to head to the beach again to surf.

Relapse possible

After two weeks, if there is no COVID-19 relapse, the prime minister said the nation could move down to Alert Level 2 by the middle of May, which would permit even greater freedoms.

Taiwan and South Korea have had similar success to New Zealand's in cornering the virus, though Singapore, which was also seen as a textbook case, is now experiencing a dramatic second wave of infections after initially relaxing its prohibitions.

Wiles says it is still too soon to know when international flights will resume to New Zealand but she says she expects the first steps may be to resume flying to other nations, such as Taiwan, or those in the South Pacific, that have also virtually wiped out the infection.

""We may end up having countries around the world that are these little islands that you could travel between,"" she said.

ADVERTISEMENT

""Going forward, it's an interesting thing how you maintain [a virus free status].""

All of that is heartening news for Zen Wallis, who is planning to be back in the water first thing once the surf ban is lifted.

""I'm psyched up. I am getting ready now,"" he said.

Still, after that instant rush, he says, he worries about how long it will take his business and so many others to recover.

""I am sure people are going to want to surf, but obviously, there's no tourism.""

""There's going to be a hit … for a long time.""

Governor Northam Signs Virginia Values Act,Virginia is first Southern state to provide sweeping anti-discrimination protections for LGBTQ people,1.0,"Governor Northam Signs Virginia Values Act

Virginia is first Southern state to provide sweeping anti-discrimination protections for LGBTQ people

RICHMOND—Governor Ralph Northam today announced he has signed the Virginia Values Act, making Virginia the first state in the South to enact comprehensive protections for the LGBTQ community against discrimination in housing, employment, public spaces, and credit applications.

Senate Bill 868, sponsored by Senator Adam Ebbin, prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in housing, public and private employment, public accommodations, and access to credit. The legislation also extends important protections to Virginians on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, pregnancy, childbirth or related medical conditions, age, marital status, disability, and status as a veteran.

“This legislation sends a strong, clear message—Virginia is a place where all people are welcome to live, work, visit, and raise a family,” said Governor Northam. “We are building an inclusive Commonwealth where there is opportunity for everyone, and everyone is treated fairly. No longer will LGBTQ Virginians have to fear being fired, evicted, or denied service in public places because of who they are.”

“With the Governor’s signing of the Virginia Values Act, we have made discrimination against our gay, lesbian and transgender friends, family, neighbors and co-workers in employment, housing and public accommodation illegal in the Commonwealth of Virginia,” said Speaker of the House Eileen Filler-Corn. “It is now the law of the land that every Virginian can work hard, earn a living wage, and live their lives without fear of discrimination based on who they are or who they love. A tremendous victory.”

“I am grateful to Governor Northam for signing the Virginia Values Act, which represents years of dedicated work by activists, legislators, and progressive members of our business community to ensure full protection for every Virginian under the law,” said Senator Adam Ebbin. “Sadly, during times of crisis like these, discrimination rises, and its effects become more apparent. When jobs are scarce and housing unaffordable, the reality of who you are must be an additional hurdle to putting food on the table or providing shelter for your family. This law provides important new protections.”

“After decades of hard work, we are closer to making Virginia the Commonwealth that we all want it to be,” said Delegate Mark Sickles. “This new law will bring protections that Virginians need to live, work, and access services free from discrimination and harassment. I am grateful to Governor Northam for signing this legislation, and to the broad coalition of dedicated advocates, legislators, constituents, faith leaders, and members of the business community, who worked together to pass the most comprehensive civil rights bill in Virginia’s history this session.”

President Joe Biden Approves Nation's First Major Offshore Wind Farm,President Joe Biden Approves Nation's First Major Offshore Wind Farm,1.0,"Turbines on the Block Island Wind Farm off the coast of Rhode Island. Photo : Scott Eisen ( Getty Images )

On Tuesday, the Biden administration officially green- lit the country’s largest offshore wind farm. It’s slated to be installed off the coast of Massachusetts and is the first step in President Joe Biden’s ambitious push to finally get the U.S. in the offshore wind game.

Comprised of up to 84 turbines split between two locations—one near the Martha’s Vineyard coast and one closer to Nantucket—the $2.8 billion Vineyard Wind project is expected to generate 800 megawatts of electricity, which is enough to power some 400,000 homes.

The farm is jointly controlled and operated by two energy firms, Avangrid Renewables and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners. It was first conceived in 2009 and has been in the process of federal permitting for more than three years, facing delays due to both the pandemic and concerns from commercial fisheries. With the federal permitting approved, it’s now expected to start supplying power by as soon as 2023. Vineyard Wind will be the first commercial-scale wind farm in the U.S.

The nation’s capacity for offshore wind energy production is massive. According to federal data, offshore wind could generate more than 2,000 gigawatts of energy, which is almost nearly double the nation’s current total electricity use.

Despite the promise, leaders have been slow to harness the potential. Currently, the nation is home to two offshore wind farms, comprised of just seven wind turbines near Rhode Island and Virginia. Together, they produce less than 50 megawatts of generation capacity. The federal approval of Vineyard Wind could start to change that, contributing to achieving the Biden administration’s goal of producing 30 gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2030.

The project also jibes with the administration’s linking of climate action and job creation. The White House estimates that the project will create about 3,600 jobs (its offshore wind plan calls for creating 77,000 direct jobs in offshore wind by the end of the decade).

“A clean energy future is within our grasp in the U.S.,” said Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland in a White House statement. “The approval of this project is an important step toward advancing the Administration’s goals to create good-paying union jobs while combatting climate change and powering our nation. Today is one of many actions we are determined to take to open the doors of economic opportunity to more Americans.”

The signs that the U.S. is ready for offshore wind are everywhere. Late last year, Rep. Raul Grijalva introduced a bill that would set a goal of 25 gigawatts of domestic offshore wind energy production by 2030. In 2018, the Trump administration—yes, you read that right—held the country’s largest offshore wind auction ever, leasing three tracts of ocean off the coast of Massachusetts and Rhode Island.

Plans for more than a dozen other offshore wind farms are in earlier stages of approval, which together could bring about 20 gigawatts of electricity online if they get the official signoff . Seven coastal states have also set offshore wind targets of their own that together, if achieved, would bring 30 gigawatts of offshore wind power online by 2035. The U.S. is one small corner of a boom in renewable energy. While the covid-19 pandemic has put a damper on economic interest in other energy industries, research shows that’s not the case for offshore wind.

This isn’t to say offshore wind expansion won’t face challenges. There will be political opposition from rich NIMBY skeptics. There will be design difficulties. And there’s the looming threat of the shortage of rare Earth minerals that are necessary for the construction of turbines. (Extracting those minerals also have some issues.) But it’s clearer than ever that we need to stop using fossil fuels to power the world, and now is the right time to jump headfirst into tackling those issues on in order to usher in a national offshore wind revolution.",https://earther.gizmodo.com/president-joe-biden-approves-nations-first-major-offsho-1846870354
"California waitress who ejected racist diner gets $82,000 in tips","California waitress who ejected racist diner gets $82,000 in tips.",1.0,"A waitress has received $82,000 in tips from people around the world who have been left heartened after they saw her stand up to a racist Silicon Valley CEO inside her restaurant.

Gennica Cochran, a server at Lucia restaurant in Carmel Valley, California, escorted Michael Lofthouse, 37, out after he yelled 'Trump is going to f*** you' at an Asian family enjoying a meal out on Fourth of July.

She was hailed an 'everyday hero' by people who have been donating money to the waitress on GoFundMe.

One page set-up to tip Cochran is titled 'A Big Tip for an Everyday Hero', and has already raised $65,000.

Two other GoFundMe accounts have raised an additional $15,000 collectively - and the money is still pouring in.

Cochran told KGO-TV that the money will allow her to pursue yoga teaching, and she is also trying to devise a way to send some of the money on to others in the service industry.

Cochran told KGO-TV that the $80,000 will allow her to pursue yoga teaching. She is also trying to devise a way to send some of the money on to others in the service industry

Cochran was seen on video last week ordering Lofthouse out of Lucia after he called Jordan Chan and her family a 'f***ing Asian piece of s**t' during a racist tirade.

'I felt very protective of them,' Ms Cochran said. 'To hear the emotion coming out of my voice, to see my mannerisms, it was unbelievable it was just something that came over me and I just did what needed to be done.

'I did what anybody else should or would do in that situation.'

Cochran said it was one of the first times her customers were allowed back into the restaurant after it reopened following the coronavirus pandemic, and she couldn't let racial abuse ruin their experience.

They had been celebrating a birthday at Bernardus Lodge and Spa's Lucia restaurant on Saturday.

The shocking footage shows Lofthouse shouting racist abuse.

Within seconds Cochran confronted Lofthouse. She said: 'You do not talk to a guest like that, you need to leave now.'

The mother of a British tech CEO who was filmed hurling vicious racist abuse at an Asian family says she is 'totally appalled' by his behaviour as MailOnline can reveal his own sister-in-law is mixed race. Michael Lofthouse was pictured flipping the bird at Jordan Chan and relatives

Jenny Chan (back left) posted the footage on Instagram. The family were celebrating the birthday of Jenny's aunt Mari Orosa (back right with Mari's husband Raymond front right)

Lofthouse called the family a 'f***ing Asian piece of s**t' before an outraged Ms Cochran stepped in and told him to 'get out'

Lofthouse, who was born in Britain, is the CEO of California-based Solid8, a small tech company.

The company has a low-budget website saying it offers industry-leading cloud storage and online security for companies. It has between two and ten employees, according to LinkedIn.

'Racist' boss's tech firm Lofthouse's Solid8 is a cloud tech services firm launched in 2017. The company's offices are based near the financial district of San Francisco, California. Solid8 aims to improve their clients' computer systems and reduce their IT costs by offering network services, infrastructure or business services that store and access data and programs over the Internet rather than a computer hard drive. On its website, the company, which also offers cyber security advice, boasts of having '38 years of collective experience' and says: 'Our team are decisive problem-solvers, our breadth and depth of experience means we've dealt with most situations before – which means we move quickly from analysis to action, working as an agile team for each project, quickly drawing upon talent from across our global network of over 100 leading Cloud Providers.' Solid8's CEO is Briton Michael Lofthouse, who according to his now-deleted LinkedIn page, graduated from Newcastle Business School, associated with Northumbria University, in 2005 and emigrated to America in 2010.

In the footage, Lofthouse targetss Chan and her family who had been at the restaurant to celebrate her aunt Mari Orosa's birthday.

Mari was accompanied at the restaurant by her husband, Raymond, a sales rep for a Mercedes car dealership in California.

The film began after Lofthouse had already apparently started on his unprovoked, racist abuse. The person filming told him to 'say that again'.

'Oh, now you're shy,' the person behind the camera said. 'Say it one more time.'

Lofthouse responded by flipping his middle finger and said 'that's what I'm saying now'.

'Trump's going to f*** you!' he then yelled, as he got up to leave the restaurant.

'You f***ers need to leave,' he said, before Cochran stepped in.

'Get out of here,' she was heard shouting.

'You are not allowed here. You do not talk to our guests like that.'

Lofthouse continued with his vile attack on the family, yelling: 'You f***ing Asian piece of s**t.

He turned to Cochran and said: 'Who are these f***ers?'

'They are valued guests,' she responded.

Lofthouse replied: 'Are they? They are valued guests in America?'

The waitress continued to tell him to 'get out' and said: 'You are not allowed here ever again.'

Chan wrote on Instagram that the 'white supremacist' businessman had begun harassing her family soon after they sang happy birthday to her aunt.

Aside from the racist comments caught on camera, she said he also told them to 'go back to whatever f****** Asian country you're from' and that 'you don't belong here'.

She added on the post that he 'had a LOT more to say after I stopped recording'.

Lofthouse later issued a grovelling apology, telling DailyMail.com: 'My behavior in the video is appalling. This was clearly a moment where I lost control and made incredibly hurtful and divisive comments.

'I would like to deeply apologize to the Chan family. I can only imagine the stress and pain they feel.

'I was taught to respect people of all races, and I will take the time to reflect on my actions and work to better understand the inequality that so many of those around me face every day.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8511011/California-waitress-ejected-racist-diner-receives-82-000-tips.html

USA TODAY Sports

Kylian Mbappe garnered global recognition for his performances in this year’s World Cup, but the proceeds he earned are not going to him.

Mbappe, who scored four goals this year as France claimed its second World Cup, decided to donate his earnings from the tournament to a charity that gives free sports instruction to hospitalized and disabled children in sports, Premiers de Cordee.

The organization also coordinates disability awareness campaigns for schools and businesses, according to the French news outlet L’Equipe. After consulting with his entourage, Mbappe decided his World Cup premiums can serve a humanitarian cause, according to L’Equipe.

Sports Illustrated reported that Mbappe earns about £17,000 per game with bonuses. The news outlet also reported that Mbappe received a £265,000 bonus (about $350,000) if France won the tournament. The French national team did just that, defeating Croatia 4-2 in the final Sunday.

Radio host Iain Lee keeps suicidal caller on the line for half an hour until ambulance arrives,Radio host (Iain Lee) keeps suicidal caller on the line for half an hour until ambulance arrives,1.0,"Radio host Iain Lee has been credited with helping save a suicidal man's life by keeping him on the phone for 30 minutes until an ambulance arrived.

The man, identified only as Chris, called during Lee's talkRADIO show on Wednesday and said he had taken an overdose.

Lee, who appeared on I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! last year, said the man was ""lying in a street in Plymouth, dying"" at the time of the call.

Chris, who said he was almost 59 and suffering from depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, explained he was close to a nightclub and told Lee: ""I don't want to die, Iain"".

Lee, 45, has previously discussed his own mental health struggles and explained he has suffered from suicidal thoughts while coming off anti-depressants.

The radio host spoke to Chris while emergency services worked to track down the caller, telling him at one point: “Shut up, man... I love you. You may want to die, but we can talk about that tomorrow.”

Meanwhile, producers gave emergency services details of Chris's appearance and location, helping them assist the caller as promptly as possible.

The man stopped talking at several points during the call, causing Lee to become increasingly worried about the caller's safety.

Lee sounded clearly relieved when Chris came back on the line, at one point telling him: “Yes, brother. The whole country is punching the air. We lost you for about 10 minutes, man.”

Police told Lee after 27 minutes that they had located the caller.

Lee tweeted after the incident: ""Tonight we took a call from a man who had taken an overdose. He was lying in a street in Plymouth, dying. We managed to keep him online, get a description of what he looked like and was wearing, work out where he was and send an ambulance and police to him.

""Kept him on the phone for 30 minutes while he got harder to understand. Long periods of silence where I thought he'd died. F***, that was intense and upsetting. Thanks for your kind words. I really hope he makes it.""

On Thursday, Lee shared another update, writing: ""Thanks everyone for your kind words. Been an odd day for so many reasons. I really appreciate your kind words.""

He planned to be back on the air at 10pm.

The ambulance service said that the caller was taken to the hospital for further treatment.

Mass. reports zero new coronavirus deaths for the first time in months,"The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, USA reported 0 deaths due to the coronavirus yesterday, the first time since March 20th.",1.0,"A state official said the startling decline in the daily death count to zero was unrelated to the data cleanup.

The Department of Public Health also said it was decreasing the official total of coronavirus deaths in the state due to “ongoing data cleaning which identifies and removes duplicate reports.” On Monday, the running tally of confirmed and probable deaths was 8,095; that number dropped to 8,054 on Tuesday.

For the first time in months, state officials on Tuesday reported zero new deaths in Massachusetts due to the deadly coronavirus pandemic, an encouraging sign that stood in stark contrast with other states nationwide that have seen recent spikes in their numbers.

The first Massachusetts death due to coronavirus was reported on Friday, March 20.

The number of deaths announced, which reflects the number reported to the state as of 10 a.m. each day, can swing dramatically from day to day. On Friday, the number was 50, on Saturday it was 28, on Sunday it was 19, and on Monday it was 35.

And although the metric might appear uplifting, officials have warned residents not to let their guard down against the virus — especially as the state heads into July 4th weekend. At a news conference earlier Tuesday, Governor Charlie Baker urged people to continue wearing face coverings, washing their hands, and practice social distancing.

“We do not want to take one step forward and two steps back as we keep climbing out of this horrific pandemic,” Baker said.

Meanwhile, the state also reported 114 new coronavirus cases — 73 confirmed and 41 probable — in Massachusetts, bringing that total tally to 108,882.

The state also reported that 5,813 new individuals had been given the coronavirus test, bringing the total number of individuals tested to 842,960. The total number of molecular tests that have been administered rose to 1,066,060.

The state also reported that new antibody tests had been completed for 918 people, bringing that total to 71,686.

Meanwhile, all four key metrics that the state is monitoring to determine the pace of reopening fell, according to Tuesday’s report.

The seven-day weighted average of positive test rates decreased slightly from 1.9 percent on Sunday to 1.8 percent on Monday. It has dropped 94 percent since April 15.

The three-day average of the number of patients hospitalized for the coronavirus also fell slightly on Monday to 748, down from from 760 a day earlier. It has dropped 79 percent since April 15.

The number of hospitals using surge capacity also dropped to one on Monday. That number is down from a high of more than 20 in early May, and has seen a 95 percent decrease since April 15.

A fourth metric, the three-day average of confirmed COVID-19 deaths by date of fatality — rather than the date reported — also fell slightly, from 18 on Friday to 16 on Saturday. It has dropped 89 percent since April 15.

Earlier Tuesday, Baker touted the state’s performance on the numbers reported Monday, particularly the metrics that are being monitored for reopening, and announced that he was relaxing the travel rules for people visiting the state from seven nearby states.

“Our public health information continues to show a downward trend in our key metrics,” Baker said. “This obviously represents solid progress as we head into July, and will continue to influence when and how we move into the next phases of reopening the Commonwealth.”

However, he warned that “COVID-19 will not be taking a summer vacation,” and pointed to other states that have seen an alarming spike in numbers recently.

“As we’ve all seen, several other states are seeing sharp increases in new cases and hospitalizations, which is a very real reminder to all of us just how contagious this virus can be,” he said.

Indeed, states like Florida, Arizona, Texas, and California have either paused or walked back reopening measures, such as closing or clamping down on bars, shutting beaches, and rolling back restaurant capacity, among other measures.

With newly reported infections running at around 40,000 a day in the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious-disease expert, warned Tuesday that the number could rocket to 100,000 if Americans don’t start following public health recommendations.

“Clearly, we are not in total control right now,” Fauci said during testimony at a Senate hearing that focused on reopening, citing recent news clips that showed some people congregating in crowds, often without masks. “We’re going to continue to be in a lot of trouble and there’s going to be a lot of hurt if that does not stop.”

While the drop in the number of announced deaths in Massachusetts was encouraging, models suggest there is still heartbreak ahead. A University of Massachusetts released Tuesday model estimated that the coronavirus death toll in the state will reach 8,505 by July 25.

The UMass estimate comes from a lab headed by UMass Amherst associate professor Nicholas Reich that collects various coronavirus pandemic models and develops a combined, or ensemble, forecast that is intended to reflect their collective wisdom.

Reich’s lab releases the ensemble forecast weekly. It only creates the forecast for a four-week window ahead because it believes forecasts aren’t reliable enough after that. Last week, the model estimated there would be 8,389 deaths tallied by July 18.

Reich’s lab posts its national- and state-level data at the Reich Lab COVID-19 Forecast Hub. The lab, already an Influenza Forecasting Center of Excellence, collaborates with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on coronavirus predictions.

The lab also feeds the data it has collected and its ensemble forecast to the agency, which posts the data on its own website. The data is also used to feed the fivethirtyeight.com website.

The closely-watched University of Washington Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation model, looking further into the future, offered a bleaker vision, predicting that Massachusetts will see as many as 10,154 deaths by Oct. 1, with a possible range of outcomes from 9,480 to 11,402 deaths.

The latest UMass ensemble model also predicts the United States as a whole will see a cumulative total of 147,865 deaths in the next four weeks. Last week it put the four-week number at 139,276. The current US death toll is over 126,000, according to Johns Hopkins University.

Spade didn't announce this on social media or make a big fuss; People magazine confirmed the news late Wednesday via his representative.

The donation will support the National Alliance on Mental Illness and Spade tells the magazine that, ""More people suffer from mental health issues than we may realize but no one should ever feel ashamed to reach out for support.""

He added, “If you or anyone you know is in need of help or guidance please contact the national suicide prevention hotline at 800-273-8255 or go to nami.org to learn more and help those who may be in need.""

Kate Spade, who was married to the comedian's brother andy, took her own life at the age of 55 last week and the ""Joe Dirt"" star has been vocal about the shock and grief that comes from losing a member of the family so suddenly.

Shortly after her death, Spade posted a happy photo to Instagram with the caption, ""Fuzzy picture but i love it. Kate and I during Christmas family photos. We had so much fun that day. She was so sharp and quick on her feet. She could make me laugh so hard. I still cant believe it. Its a rough world out there people, try to hang on.""

And then this past week, Spade went back to work, addressing the loss further during a stand-up routine in Southern California.

""Thank you for coming. It was a rough week, but I didn't want to cancel and I appreciate you all coming out here,"" he told the audience, according to E! News. ""And, if my jokes don't work then I get sort of a free pass.""

Spade's brother Andy has also spoken out since Kate's death, saying that her suicide was a complete shock to the family.

""We were in touch with her the night before and she sounded happy. There was no indication and no warning that she would do this,"" he told the New York Times. ""It was a complete shock. And it clearly wasn’t her. There were personal demons she was battling.""

President-Elect Joe Biden's dog has made some ""major"" moves over the past few years.

In November 2018, the German shepherd was sitting at the Delaware Humane Association in Wilmington, waiting for a forever home, when Joe and Dr. Jill Biden walked in and picked Major to be their new family member.

Get push notifications with news, features and more.

""We are so happy to welcome Major to the Biden family, and we are grateful to the Delaware Humane Association for their work in finding forever homes for Major and countless other animals,"" the Bidens said in a statement shortly after the dog's adoption.

Flash forward a few years later and the rescue pooch is preparing to move into the White House with the Bidens' other dog Champ and the family's future pet cat. The move to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is especially noteworthy for Major since he will be the first shelter dog to ever reside at the White House.

To celebrate this big win for rescue pets, Major's former home, the Delaware Humane Association (DHA), is throwing the canine his own ""Indoguration"" party on Jan. 17, a few days before Joe Biden's Jan. 20 inauguration.

The virtual event honoring Major will be hosted by the DHA and Pumpkin Pet Insurance, and will be emceed by TODAY show contributor Jill Martin — Lindsey Vonn's three dogs are also set to attend.

All animal lovers, and their dogs, are invited and encouraged to attend this special ""indoguration."" The DHA is asking for a minimum donation of $10 to participate in the event highlighting Major's amazing rise to First Dog. All of the funds raised during the event will go to the DHA ""to help support the shelter’s vital pet and pet owner community services,"" according to a release from DHA and Pumpkin Pet Insurance, which added that the donations will ""help more shelter animals like Major find their forever homes and spread awareness about the need to help pet owners who are financially struggling to care for their pets.""

While the event's main mission is to celebrate Major and help other pets find forever homes, the ""indoguration"" also hopes to set a record for ""the largest virtual gathering of dogs,"" so all human participants are encouraged to log on with their pup pals.

""We are thrilled to participate in what will hopefully be the world’s largest Zoom call for dogs,"" DHA’s executive director, Patrick J. Carroll, said in a statement. ""2020 was a tough year for all of us financially – both for animal shelters and pet owners alike. Here at DHA our mission is to make ‘friends for life’ by connecting people with animals, and by building strong relationships to better serve our community. With Major heading to the White House, it’s our sincere hope that we can continue to connect more homeless animals with families than ever before. If a shelter dog is good enough for the White House, they’re good enough for your house!""",https://people.com/pets/joe-biden-rescue-dog-major-inauguration-event/
Japanese proposal to reinstate commercial whaling defeated,Japanese proposal to reinstate commercial whaling defeated,1.0,"Members of the International Whaling Commission defeated a Japanese proposal to reinstate commercial whaling at a meeting in Brazil on Friday.

The commission suspended commercial whaling in the 1980s, but Japan argued that stocks have recovered sufficiently for the ban to be lifted and that no good reason exists to maintain a measure that was meant to be temporary. It has repeatedly tried to lift the ban.

Other countries argued that many whale populations are still vulnerable and that whaling is increasingly seen as unacceptable.

Japan's proposal was defeated Friday by a vote of 41-27 in Florianopolis, Brazil.

""This is not a debate about human rights nor is it a debate about global food security,"" Nick Gales, Australia's commissioner to the IWC, said during a debate on Thursday. ""It is a business proposition against which many parties hold legitimate environmental and welfare concerns.""

After the vote, Japan suggested that it would reconsider its membership in the international body.

It has argued that the commission has become ""intolerant"" and remains deadlocked on many issues because of the divide between countries that prize conservation and those that push for the sustainable use of whales.

Japan had proposed changes to the way the body operates, including a provision which would allow measures to be adopted by a simple, rather than super, majority.

""If scientific evidence and diversity are not respected, if commercial whaling based on science is completely denied, and if there is no possibility for the different positions and views to coexist with mutual understanding and respect, then Japan will be pressed to undertake a fundamental reassessment of its position as a member of the IWC,"" Masaaki Taniai, Japan's state minister of agriculture, forestry and fisheries, said after the vote Friday.

Patrick Ramage, director of marine conservation at the International Fund for Animal Welfare, noted that Japan has frequently threatened to pull out of the body.

The measure's ""adoption would have been a big step backwards for the IWC, returning us to the bygone days of open commercial whaling instead of becoming a modern conservation body,"" Ramage said in a statement. ""The real way forward for whales is conservation and responsible whale watching, not cruel and unnecessary whale killing.""

The Japanese have hunted whales for centuries and see it as a cheaper alternative source of protein. They currently hunt under a commission provision that allows killing whales for research purposes.

The number of whales Japan kills each year is now capped at 333, about a third of the number it used to kill before the International Court of Justice ruled in 2014 that its program wasn't scientific in nature.

Some, however, say the research program remains a cover for commercial whaling because the whale meat is sold for food.",http://www.foxnews.com/world/2018/09/14/japanese-proposal-to-reinstate-commercial-whaling-defeated.html
Man removes Nazi swastika tattoos after unlikely friendship,Former neo-Nazi removes swastika tattoos after unlikely friendship,1.0," -- Colorado resident Michael Kent recently sat down at a tattoo parlor in Colorado Springs to have his swastikas covered up.

Kent, a former neo-Nazi, credits an African-American parole officer named Tiffany Whittier with helping him to see beyond skin color and changing his views about white supremacy.

“If it wasn’t for her I would have seeped back into it,” said Kent. “I look at her as family.”

Whittier, 45, even inspired Kent, 38, to take down the Nazi flags he had hanging in his living room and replace them with smiley faces.

“I’m not here to judge him. That’s not my job to judge. My job is to be that positive person in someone’s life,” Whittier said.

Added Kent, “When you wake up and see a smiley face, you’re going to go to work and you’re going to smile.”

Kent now works full-time on a chicken farm in Colorado, where all his co-workers are Hispanic.

“Before all this, I wouldn’t work for anybody or with anybody that wasn’t white,” said Kent. “[Now] we have company parties, or they have quinceañeras, I’m the only white guy there!”

Redemption Ink, a national non-profit that offers free removals of hate-related tattoos, helped connect Kent with Fallen Heroes Tattoo in Colorado to begin the 15-hour process of covering his swastikas. The sterile environment is new to Kent who had his previous ink work done in prison.

“I’ve never, never, never been inside of a tattoo shop getting a professional tattoo,” he said.

Kent believes the painful process will help him move forward after spending years as a member of a violent skinhead group based in Arizona. As a father of two young children, Kent also hopes his children will see the world differently.

“I don’t want my kids to live the life I lived and live with hate,” said Kent. “I want my kids to know me for who I am now—a good father, a hard worker, and a good provider.”",http://abcnews.go.com/US/man-removes-nazi-swastika-tattoos-friendship/story?id=49496501&cid=social_fb_abcn
Dog deemed ‘unadoptable' to become first-ever deaf K-9 in Washington,Dog deemed ‘unadoptable' to become first-ever deaf K-9 in Washington,1.0,"SEATTLE — When Ghost was a puppy, around 3 months old, he was found homeless in Florida.

He is deaf, with white fur and brown eyes.

Ghost was deemed “unadoptable” because of an abundance of energy and occasional indifference to people. His deafness would also have required owners willing to learn new ways of communicating.

In Florida, young Ghost was scheduled to be euthanized. Swamp Haven Humane in Florida wanted to give Ghost another chance at a forever home.

So they reached out to several animal shelters around the country, including Olympic Peninsula Humane Society in Port Angeles, which agreed to take him in.

Olympic Peninsula Humane knows by now to reach out to Barb Davenport when they have a high-energy puppy. When no one showed interest in adopting Ghost, they called Barb.

Barb started handling dogs when she was a little girl, only 10 years old.

She participated in American Kennel Club conformation and junior showmanship as well as the 4-H dog programs -- then joined the U.S. Army in 1975.

She enlisted in the military specifically to become a K-9 handler, officials with the Washington State Department of Corrections said.

In 1979, she became one.

Barb said she feels the best part of her job is taking dogs who might not be able to find forever homes, and working to help them become important members of their communities.

When she met Ghost for the first time, “he was very focused and determined to locate his ball when thrown or hidden,” Barb said. She felt he could be a good K-9.

At this point, Barb has trained over 450 rescued dogs into narcotics dogs. All of the Washington state DOC’s K-9s are originally from shelters.

Now 2 and a half years old, Ghost lives with his new handler, Joe Henderson. Ghost is in training as a narcotics detection dog for the Washington DOC.

He’ll be with Henderson for the rest of his ""forever,"" helping to serve the community as the first deaf dog in Washington state's K-9 history.

Friends raising money to get disabled woman a new bike,My community came together to buy a new bike for a woman who had hers stolen. She lives with cerebral palsy and used her bike as transportation to all destinations.,1.0,"A thief is making it harder for a woman with a severe disability to get to work. And now friends are trying to raise money to get her back on the road.

Bridget Kuhlman has cerebral palsy. She can’t drive and walking any distance is a strain.

So Kuhlman rode a special 3-wheel bike to her job at Arby’s on 1st Avenue S.E.

She parked her bike next to the restaurant’s fenced-in dumpster area in full view of the drive through window.

Nothing happened for two years until last Friday when someone snipped the lock and rode off. Now her friends are trying to make it right with a fund raiser to get her a new bike.

Kuhlman says she was devastated last Friday when she got off work and found her bike gone.

“I was very shocked and I lost it. I was crying because I’m like what am I going to do,” she said.

But that shock eventually turned to elation when she learned her boss at the fast food restaurant was organizing a fund drive to buy her a new 3-wheeler.

“Yes, I lost my bike and yes it’s not right. But I’m glad I have a boss who got it started even with her own family,” Kuhlman said.

Arby’s store manager Angie Takes launched a Go Fund Me page called “Bike for Bridget” with her own family making the first contributions.

The hope is to do better than the used pawn shop 3-wheeler that someone swiped.

Takes says she hopes to get a bike with more back support to make pedaling easier for Bridget and lights for riding at night. Certainly, she plans to buy a better bike lock.

“Bridget goes to the laundromat with her bike. She does everything with her bike. She has two dogs and gives them rides on her bike. It was something I had to do,” Takes said.

Bridget says nobody saw the bike disappear so she doesn’t know what happened or when. All she knows is she’d like the freedom to move about again. And that means getting another bike she can ride.

"Kenyan Woman Saves 15,000 Young Girls From Female Genital Mutilation • EBONY","Kenyan Woman Saves 15,000 Young Girls From Female Genital Mutilation",1.0,"Nice Nailantei Leng’ete was recently named one of Time’s Most Influential People, and for good reason. The 27-year-old Kenyan has made it her life’s work to help young African girls escape “female cutting,” commonly referred to as female genital mutilation (FGM). While discussing her mission with Yahoo Lifestyle, Leng’ete explained the cause is close to her heart because she escaped the archaic practice herself at 8 years old.

“I escaped by running away,” Leng’ete shared, saying she and her sister hid in a tree until the ceremony was over. And she has now helped over 15,000 others avoid FGM as well.

Leng’ete is also working to rid Africa of child marriage and FGM by 2030, introducing alternative rites of passage to her male-dominated Maasai community.

“FGM, for Maasai, is a rite of passage from girlhood to womanhood. Women are not considered women unless they have gone through FGM,” Leng’ete said, explaining the societal role of female circumcisions. “FGM in my community connects to girls ending their education, with child marriage, and with teenage pregnancies. A girl is 10 or 12 years old when she undergoes FGM. Then she’s told she’s a woman, and that means she’s ready for marriage, and that means she has children. They all go together.”

Leng’ete knew she was destined for more while witnessing the ritual as a child.

“I saw pain. I saw death. Since I was 7 years old, I used to attend these ceremonies in my community with girls undergoing FGM. I saw my friends leave school and get married. And I wanted to continue my education.”

That’s just what she did, becoming the first girl in her village to go to high school. Her school uniform inspired other girls in her community, who later sought her help to avoid “the cut.” While she initially hid those seeking help, this made her a wanted woman in the region, leading her to take a different approach.

The young hero, instead, received permission to share information about sexual health and wellness with her village. After four long years of educating her community, the elders were convinced that Maasai would be more prosperous if women were able to stay in school longer, marry later and forego female circumcisions. Elders officially renounced the practice of FGM in 2014.

“I’m driven by passion,” Leng’ete said. “Being able to protect these younger girls from these harmful practices is what I want to do; it’s an important job. When I see the girls in school, that’s my happiness. I’m hoping to reach many more — every girl — if I’m able.”",https://www.ebony.com/news-views/kenyan-woman-saves-15000-young-girls-from-female-genital-mutilation
Coronavirus vaccine for 30 million Britons by September if trial succeeds,"Oxford SARS-CoV2 vaccine to be made available to 30 million Brits by September, if trials succeed",1.0,"Plans are in place to roll out a COVID-19 vaccine to 30 million people by September if trials are successful, Business Secretary Alok Sharma has said.

It comes as the UK announced a further 170 deaths of people with coronavirus - the lowest since the day after lockdown began.

Speaking at Sunday's Downing Street news conference, which was delayed due to technical difficulties, the cabinet minister said work by the University of Oxford to find an effective drug was ""progressing well"".

Image: The government has committed more than a quarter of a billion pounds towards developing a vaccine

But while pointing out the government had now committed more than a quarter of a billion pounds towards developing a COVID-19 vaccine in the UK, Mr Sharma warned there was no certainty one would ever be found.

He said: ""In order to definitively conquer this disease we need to find a safe, workable vaccine.

""Last month I announced a new vaccine task force to co-ordinate the efforts of government, academia and industry in the critical mission to find a vaccine.

""I'm very proud of how quickly our scientists and researchers have come together in their efforts developing a vaccine that will combat coronavirus.""

He added: ""The first clinical trial of the Oxford vaccine is progressing well with all phase one participants having received their vaccine dose on schedule earlier this week.

""The speed at which Oxford University has designed and organised these complex trials is genuinely unprecedented.""

The secretary of state also said Imperial College London was ""making good progress"" and would look to move into clinical trials for a vaccine by mid-June, with larger scale trials in October.

So far the government has invested £47m in the Oxford and Imperial vaccine programmes. Mr Sharma announced a further £84m in new funding ""to help accelerate their work"".

He added: ""This new money will help mass-produce the Oxford vaccine so that if current trials are successful we have dosages to start vaccinating the UK population straight away.""

He said the pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca had finalised a ""global licensing agreement"" with Oxford University with government support, and added: ""This means that if the vaccine is successful AstraZeneca will work to make 30 million doses available by September for the UK as part of an agreement for over 100 million doses in total.""

He said ""the UK will be first to get access"" but that the government would also ensure that ""we're able to make the vaccine available to developing countries at the lowest possible cost"".

Mr Sharma also announced the UK's first vaccines manufacturing innovation centre is expected to open in summer 2021, a year ahead of plan, after receiving an extra £93m in government cash.

He said: ""The centre, which is already under construction, will have capacity to produce enough vaccine doses to serve the entire UK population in as little as six months.""

But with no guarantee of a successful vaccine being found, he also stressed the need to look at other drug treatments for those who get the virus.

He reported that six drugs have entered initial live clinical trials, which could be expanded if the results were positive.",https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-covid-19-vaccine-for-30-million-by-september-if-trial-succeeds-says-sharma-11990039
'I never saw stars before': Gene therapy brings back 8-year-old Canadian boy's sight,'I never saw stars before': Gene therapy brings back 8-year-old Canadian boy's sight,1.0,"TORONTO -- For the thousands of Canadians at risk of blindness, eight-year-old Sam is a beacon of hope.

He is the first Canadian to be treated with gene replacement therapy for a rare form of blindness which had left Sam unable to see sky on a cloudy day, and unable to make out shapes in the dark.

“Sometimes you have to walk in the night and I couldn’t see things and you bump into things,” Sam told CTV News.

He had to have lights on always, and had trouble seeing his shoes or objects on the floor. And the condition was progressive, meaning things would get worse as he grew older -- a daunting prospect when there was no treatment available.

But now he can see cloudy skies, shoes and more. The best part of his improved vision, says Sam, are the stars at night.

“I never saw stars before,” he said. “And I also never saw airplanes flying at night.”

He was diagnosed after birth with a genetic disorder called retinitis pigmentosa, a form of genetic retinal degeneration resulting from mutations in the RPE65 gene.

“You lose perception of light,” Dr. Elise Heon, of Sick Kids Hospital, explained to CTV News. “You end up in darkness and [it’s] slowly progressive, it's relentless, your visual field shrinks and shrinks and shrinks and shrinks.”

Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) affects between 1 in 3,500 to 1 in 4,000 Canadians, according to Fighting Blindness Canada. It actually refers to a group of disorders, as there are numerous versions of RP depending on which pair of genes are damaged. More than 64 genes have been identified by scientists as potentially having mutations that cause RP.

Now, Canada has approved the first-ever gene replacement therapy for this form of blindness. Sick Kids Hospital has 29 children in its program with this mutation. The drug can be used on children and adults with the condition, but the earlier it’s used, the more sight it will save, doctors believe.

“It's a huge deal, because for these patients before, there’s no treatments,” Heon said.

She said she had recently met two patients, brothers, who were suffering the same problem as Sam, and for the first time, she was able to provide hope.

“They're 10 years old, and they're losing their vision,” she said. “If we do nothing, they're just going, fine, they'll just end up with no light reception. So for the first time [we were] able to say, well, actually we need to have a discussion. And it was just, it was priceless.”

The gene therapy, which goes by the brand name Luxturna, was developed in the U.S by the drug company Spark Therapeutics.

It works by placing a copy of the healthy gene into inactivated viruses, which are then injected into the retina. The gene then allows cells to produce the necessary protein to convert light into an electrical signal in the retina in order to provide healthy vision and prevent progression of the disease.

It is the first targeted gene therapy to be approved by Health Canada, which gave it the all-clear this week.

Back in 2019, Sam and his family travelled to the U.S to get the new gene therapy because it wasn’t available in Canada yet.

His mother, Sarah Banon, noticed changes quickly.

“About a week later, I noticed he could get dressed by [himself],” she said. “He could get his shoes on by himself, independently.”

His improvements have continued in the year since he first received the gene therapy.

“He is so much more confident,” his mother told CTV News. “Like getting dressed by himself, matching clothes, doesn’t have to have things enlarged. Being able to [see], even when it’s dark outside, no lights on and it is a cloudy day. He would have to, at school, keep the lights on.

“Now he is able to function as a normal child.”

With the approval of this gene therapy in Canada, doctors are hoping to be able to use it on more patients who qualify -- and the earlier the better.

Dr. Peter Kertes, a vitreo-retinal surgeon and Ophthalmologist-in-Chief at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, told CTV News that the approval of the therapy is “fantastic.”

“This is a huge breakthrough,” he said. “Most of the advances that we have in medicine are incremental. Every once in a while, once in a generation, something revolutionary like this comes along that really changes the course of therapy.”

Luxturna specifically treats individuals with biallelic mutations of the RPE65 gene -- meaning they have mutations in that gene stemming from both parents -- which manifests as either RP or Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). It’s a very small patient group compared to the entirety of Canadians with inherited retinal diseases.

This may be just one gene therapy for one condition, but it will open to the door to this strategy being used in other scenarios, Kertes pointed out.

“This is the tip of the iceberg. I think this is a vector that will prove to be very effective and holds great promise,” he said. “I think many people who are living with blindness or facing blindness, have much to look forward to. I think we're on the cusp of a revolution in this group of diseases.”

The company licensing the therapy, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc., isn’t detailing the cost, but based on the price in the U.S it could top $1.1 million in Canada, making it among the most expensive drugs in the country.

The therapy is currently under review by both the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) and the Institut national d’excellence en santé et en services sociaux (INESSS).

Novartis said in a statement that they “look forward to receiving their recommendations following Health Canada’s approval.”

They said they are eager “to help eligible Canadians affected by this rare disease gain access to the first-ever gene replacement therapy as quickly as possible.”

The Patented Medicine Prices Review Board will be disclosing their new guidelines in terms of capping drug prices in an online media briefing this Thursday.

As this will likely be the first of many gene replacement therapies -- with similarly high price tags -- Ottawa and the provinces will have to make the decision on whether it will be covered by provincial health plans. The question is an ongoing ethical debate, with some saying that drug companies will only take advantage of it if governments show that they are willing to pay.

“Should it be the responsibility for the government to pay for any drug at any price?” Marc-André Gagnon, a researcher with Carleton University who looks into pharmaceutical policy, told CTV News. “The problem is, if we say yes to this question, you can be sure that the day after, all the drugs in the market will be asking for much higher prices.”

“It’s a very expensive drug,” Heon acknowledged.

However, she pointed out that this is a rare disease, and it’s “not a recurrent treatment.” It’s a one-time injection to the eyes.

“You treat both eyes and then that’s it,” she said.

“To be able to change someone's life is quite a privilege. And to be able to prevent someone from going blind is a real privilege.”

For Sam and his mother, the gift of independence has been priceless.

“This is a story of hope,” his mother said. “A child told ‘it is what it is.’”

And now, when he looks up at night, he can see stars.",https://www.ctvnews.ca/mobile/health/i-never-saw-stars-before-gene-therapy-brings-back-8-year-old-canadian-boy-s-sight-1.5145830
"New Zealand wants to make people happy, not rich - will it work?","New Zealand wants to make people happy, not rich - New Zealand’s latest budget, unveiled this week, is being touted as the first in a Western country to put well-being over economic pressures.",1.0,"New Zealand’s priorities are changing REX/Shutterstock

New Zealand’s latest budget, unveiled this week, is being touted as the first in a Western country to put well-being over economic pressures.

The country’s prime minister Jacinda Ardern promised billions of dollars in additional funds to address mental health problems, suicide and child poverty. Almost NZ$2 billion is earmarked for mental health services, following yet another year of the country having the highest teen and young adult suicide rates in Western countries.

As well as boosting existing mental health services, more money will be used to help people with mild or moderate mental health issues before they become an emergency.

Almost NZ$200 million will go to an initiative to provide long-term shelter for people who are homeless, with no strings attached, and more than NZ$1 billion to addressing child poverty.

“Today we have laid the foundation for not just one well-being budget, but a different approach for government decision-making altogether,” Ardern said while unveiling her budget.

The goal is to downplay the importance of gross domestic product (GDP), a measurement of country’s economic activity that is normally seen as a key indicator of success. But despite what Ardern and her team suggest, no budgets are solely about GDP.

“All budgets in pretty much all developed countries are well-being budgets,” says Arthur Grimes of the Motu Economic and Public Policy Research Trust, New Zealand. He notes that the definition of well-being is welfare, and virtually every budget allocates money to services such as poverty, mental health and housing.

Grimes is also sceptical about how well-being will be measured, with around 60 different indicators proposed. “In my view that’s a really scattergun approach,” he says.

Child poverty is the only metric being tracked, he says, making it difficult to assess whether the budget will achieve what it is designed to do.

One way of tracking well-being is to ask people how they rate their lives overall. But a limitation is that it might take several years for policies to shift the population’s aggregated well-being up or down compared to other countries – beyond the short time-frame politicians operate in.

Nevertheless, the government could still use these self-reported questionnaires to assess specific interventions, for example, someone’s well-being before and after they move into public housing, Grimes suggests.

New Zealand is actually not the first country to prioritise well-being. The Kingdom of Bhutan has discussed the need to value happiness over economic growth since the 1970s, and made it official with its “gross national happiness index” in 2008.

The French launched a well-being framework following a 2009 report commissioned by then-president Nicholas Sarkozy, that led to ongoing tracking of “new indicators of wealth”. These include poverty, education, healthy life expectancy, income inequality and carbon footprint.

The UK also had a short-lived attempt at bringing well-being to the forefront under former prime minister David Cameron. While it hasn’t overtaken GDP in budget discussions, the UK’s Office for National Statistics continues to track well-being, giving useful insights into the population’s life satisfaction, happiness, employment levels and more.

Perhaps the key difference is that New Zealand says it is placing well-being at the heart of the budget. It might take many years for the machinery of government to come around to it, but the reframing of a country’s success could start there.",https://www.newscientist.com/article/2205026-new-zealand-wants-to-make-people-happy-not-rich-will-it-work/
"Beaumont, Texas: In a city with no water, two men get Coca-Cola's permission to steal it","Coca-Cola grants permission to two men In Beaumont, Texas -- a city with no water -- to steal bottled water from the company's warehouse",1.0,"In a city with no water, here is a list of items required to break into a warehouse and steal 14 cases of bottled water:

One (1) hand saw

One (1) hammer

One (1) hovercraft, capable of zinging over the flooded streets of Beaumont, Texas, at 60 miles an hour.

Oh, and permission from the Coca-Cola Company.

Fortunately, Bill Zang recently found himself equipped with all four things. At a few minutes after 3 p.m. on Saturday he killed the hovercraft’s engines and floated toward the Coca-Cola warehouse on the northern edge of Beaumont. At the back gate, Zang hacked the lock with a saw, then his friend Sam Byers slammed the lock with a hammer.

The lock broke. The gate swung wide. Both men laughed.

“This is so much fun!” said Byers, happy finally to find water in Beaumont, where the water treatment plant had been offline for two days.

Story continues after this collection of Harvey video reports:

A week after Hurricane Harvey made landfall, most of the rescue and recovery efforts in south Texas are no fun at all. The work is simultaneously plodding and emotionally charged. Relief workers spend days floating through flooded neighborhoods, checking and rechecking houses to make sure all the people and pets have been evacuated.

Sometimes they rescue a cat. Sometimes they discover a corpse. Sometimes they find nothing but flooded homes and silence. At this point, as the adrenaline of early rescue efforts fades into fatigue, many rescuers find the inertia of routine becomes their primary fuel.

“I have no idea when we got here,” said Zang, president of the Hovercraft Unlimited company, who drove from his home in Rockport, Illinois, with two hovercraft to help rescue hurricane victims. “What was that, two days ago? Four? The days all start running together after a while.”

Sometimes, however, the routines get scrambled, and relief workers get the opportunity to do something they will remember for the rest of their lives. Their stories serve as a reminder that even though the sky over south Texas has brightened, and the nation’s attention has begun to move on with the rain, thousands of people are still in desperate need of help.

“There is still a lot of work to do,” Zang said.

For Edwin Toy, the break in the monotony came Thursday night, when he was the lead driver of a 16-truck convoy delivering bottled water from Houston to Beaumont. The trip normally takes about an hour and a half, Toy said.

On Thursday it took 10 hours. Toy sat in the cab of his truck with water lapping halfway up his gas tank.

“We just had to get through,” said Toy, 53, a driver for the H-E-B Grocery Company. “I don’t think I’ll ever forget it.”

For Cassidy Meeks, the adrenaline came from running up and down U.S. Route 69 northeast of Beaumont, looking for people to save. At 3:30 p.m. on Saturday, Meeks met a woman at a nearby Shell gas station who said her brother was trapped on the highway by water rushing from the flooded Pine Island Bayou.

Meeks didn’t have any special gear at her disposal. She simply started walking. She went north as far as she could, hugging the highway’s concrete median for support as the water rose to her neck.

Finally she turned around and flagged down Zang, aboard his bright blue hovercraft.

“He’s out there somewhere, but I can’t find him,” Meeks, 20, of Joshua, Texas, told Zang. “We’ve got to find him. It sounds like he’s about to drown.”

Zang was not excited about the mission. The current was moving at about 15 miles an hour, he said, and one mistake could drown both himself and the man he was trying to save. He roared off anyway, sending a plume of spray behind his craft’s main propeller.

Seven minutes later Zang returned with Cory Adams, looking wet and sheepish, sitting in the backseat.

""He was in the nasty part"" of the water flow, said Zang. ""If you fall in there, you're swept away for 2 miles and nobody will ever find you.""

No one else in the vicinity had a boat powerful enough to even get close to Adams, however. He had been in the torrent for an hour, he said, and he was losing strength.

""I thought I was going to drown,"" said Adams. ""If he didn't come and save me, there's no way I would have made it.""

Compared with most of his rescue missions after Hurricane Harvey, Zang’s effort to remove water from the Coca-Cola warehouse was a bit of a lark. Someone with the Coca-Cola Company informed Beaumont’s Fire Department that the facility contained thousands of bottles of fresh water, but flooding in and around the building prevented people in most vehicles from entering and retrieving it.

The firefighters asked Zang if he could help, he said. And so he and Byers found themselves standing behind the Coca-Cola warehouse a few minutes after 3 p.m. After entering the gate they motored to the building, where Byers broke a window with a hammer, reached inside and pulled a door open.

Inside they found tens of thousands of bottles of Fanta, Dr. Pepper, Coca-Cola and Dasani brand bottled water. They loaded 14 cases of water onto the hovercraft’s flat deck, powered up and sped away. The cases later would be picked up by other volunteers and delivered to National Guard troops, who would distribute them to Harvey evacuees.

Trader Joe’s Phasing Out Single-Use Plastics Nationwide Following Customer Petition,Trader Joe’s Phasing Out Single-Use Plastics Nationwide Following Customer Petition,1.0,"As the world suffocates from its plastic addiction, a growing number of businesses are stepping up to the plate to reduce their plastic waste. Most recently, Trader Joe's announced that it will be taking steps to cut back on plastic and other packaging waste after a petition launched by Greenpeace harnessed nearly 100,000 signatures.



At the end of last year, the company announced several improvements geared towards making packaging more sustainable in an effort to eliminate more than 1 million pounds of plastic from stores. Already, the retailer has stopped offering single-use plastic carryout bags nationwide and is replacing plastic produce bags and Styrofoam meat trays with biodegradable and compostable options.

""As a neighborhood grocery store, we feel it is important for us to be the great neighbor our customers deserve. Part of that means better managing our environmental impact,"" Kenya Friend-Daniel, public relations director for Trader Joe's, told EcoWatch in an email. ""As we recently shared with our customers, we are working to reduce the amount of packaging in our stores and while we have made a number of positive changes in this space, the world is ongoing.""

Each year, enough plastic is thrown away to circle the earth a whopping four times. Despite that, just one-quarter of plastics produced in the U.S. is recycled even though recycling plastic takes 88 percent less energy than making it from raw materials. If just three-quarters of plastics were recycled, the Recycling Coalition of Utah says people could save an estimated 1 billion gallons of oil and 44 million cubic yards of landfill space annually.

""Every minute of every single day the equivalent of a truckload of plastic enters our oceans. Not only are these plastics hurting or killing marine animals, they are impacting all of us through our seafood, sea salt, tap water, and even the air we breathe,"" Greenpeace U.S.A. plastics campaigner David Pinsky told EcoWatch. ""We know that we can't recycle our way out of this crisis, as only 9 percent of the plastics ever made have actually been recycled.""

In recent years, a number of companies have taken the lead in reducing plastic waste, including United Kingdom food retailer A.S.D.A., who plans to remove single-use cups and cutlery this year. McDonald's says that 100 percent of its packaging will come from renewable, recycled or certified sustainable sources within the next seven years while water company Evian plans to go carbon neutral and plastic free by 2020. It's a solid start in battling the so-called ""war on plastics,"" one that Trader Joe's says is just a small part of its ""never-ending work.""

Indeed, plastic has been found on every continent – including Antarctica – and at the bottom of the world's deepest waters.

""For far too long, corporations have deflected blame and made the issue of plastics about individual responsibility, but it's time for the world's largest corporations and retailers to show some accountability. The only way we are going to tackle this crisis is by pressuring corporations and governments to move away from throwaway plastics for good, and toward systems of reuse,"" said Pinsky.

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey Donating $1 Billion of His Equity in Square to COVID-19 Relief Efforts,Jack Dorsey Donating $1 Billion of His Equity in Square to COVID-19 Relief Efforts,1.0,"Jack Dorsey, CEO of and payments company Square, said he is moving $1 billion of his equity in Square to fund COVID-19 relief efforts and eventually other causes.

Dorsey, who has a net worth of about $3.3 billion according to Forbes, announced the plan Tuesday on Twitter. He said the $1 billion represents about 28% of his wealth. The funds will be distributed through his Start Small LLC charitable fund.

“Why now? The needs are increasingly urgent, and I want to see the impact in my lifetime,” Dorsey, 43, wrote on Twitter. “I hope this inspires others to do something similar. Life is too short, so let’s do everything we can today to help people now.”

According to a Google Doc that Dorsey set up to disclose his donations, the first funding he contributed was $100,000 on April 2 to America’s Food Fund, an initiative launched by Leonardo DiCaprio, Apple, Laurene Powell Jobs, and the Ford Foundation and backed by Oprah Winfrey to provide food to those in need during the coronavirus crisis.

Dorsey said that “After we disarm this pandemic,” the focus of the fund will shift to two other causes: girls health and education and universal basic income (UBI). That’s because “I believe they represent the best long-term solutions to the existential problems facing the world,” he wrote. “UBI is a great idea needing experimentation. Girl’s health and education is critical to balance.”

Dorsey also explained that he is tapping into his Square holdings because “I own a lot more Square” than Twitter equity, and that he will need to pace sales of the stock “over some time.” He added, “The impact this money will have should benefit both companies over the long-term because it’s helping the people we want to serve.”

According to Dorsey, he has previously donated $40 million to “many orgs with proven impact and efficiency in the past, mostly anonymously” but said he is making his contributions public because, “It’s important to show my work so I and others can learn.”

Dorsey’s dual-CEO status has raised questions among investors about how effectively he’s able to lead Twitter and Square simultaneously. In March, Twitter reached an agreement with activist investor Elliott Management — which reportedly had been looking to oust Dorsey — under which Dorsey remained chief exec of the social network. In addition, private-equity firm Silver Lake invested $1 billion in Twitter, while Twitter also appointed Elliott and Silver Lake execs to its board.",https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/jack-dorsey-donating-1-billion-of-his-equity-in-square-to-covid-19-relief-efforts-1234573680/
"A small city in Iowa is devoting 1,000 acres of land to America’s vanishing bees","A small city in Iowa is devoting 1,000 acres of land to America's vanishing bees",1.0,"A bee visits a flower Geoffrey Fairchild via Flickr CC by 2.0

You’ve probably heard the news that our nation’s bees are in trouble. Pollinators have been disappearing for decades, and the population crash could threaten the global food supply. Now, a small city in Iowa has decided to do something about it.

This spring, Cedar Rapids (population: 130,000) will seed 188 acres with native prairie grasses and wildflowers. The city’s plan is to eventually create 1,000 acres of bee paradise by planting these pollinator-friendly foodstuffs.

Scientists think the pollinator crisis is caused by a variety of factors, including pesticides, pathogens, and climate change. Meanwhile, with farms, parking lots, mowed lawns, and other human developments replacing wildflower fields, bees have been losing habitat and their food supply. While many of the drivers behind bee population decline remain mysterious, the people of Cedar Rapids hope to at least give pollinators places to perch and plants to feed on.

The 1,000 Acre Pollinator Initiative grew out of a partnership with the Monarch Research Project(MRP), whose goal is to restore monarch butterfly populations. It was Cedar Rapids Park Superintendent Daniel Gibbins who proposed converting 1,000 acres into pollinator habitat over five years. So far, the project has secured $180,000 in funding from the state and the MRP.

“With the agricultural boom around 100 years ago, about 99.9 percent of all the native habitat of Iowa has been lost,” says Gibbins, who is spearheading the project. “When you convert it back to what was originally native Iowa, you’re going to help a lot more than just native pollinators. You’re helping birds, amphibians, reptiles, mammals—everything that’s native here relies on native vegetation.”

Prairie revival

Cedar Rapids has developed a special mix of grasses and wildflowers to help restore that native habitat. The seed mix includes 39 species of wildflowers, and 7 species of native prairie grasses. While bees and butterflies are mostly attracted to the flowers, the hardy prairie grasses will prevent weeds and invasive species from moving in and choking out the flowers.

Gibbins and his team have catalogued all the unused public land where they could potentially plant the flowers and grasses. The list includes not only the rarely frequented corners of parks, golf courses, and the local airport, but also sewage ditches, water retention basins, and roadway right-of-ways, totaling nearly 500 acres. Cedar Rapids is working with other cities within the county to reach its 1,000-acre target.

Restoring native wildflowers and prairies grasses will help Iowa’s bees and butterflies, as well as other native animals. Cedar Rapids Parks and Recreation

Before they can seed the land with the special pollinator plant mix, Gibbins’ crew has to “knock back the undesirable vegetation.” That means mowing down, burning off, or in some cases applying herbicide to get rid of grass, weeds, and invasive species. They’ll lay down the special seed mixture in the spring and fall.

“You can’t just seed them and walk away,” says Gibbins. Although the pollinator habitat will be lower maintenance than a green turf that needs to be mown every week, the prairie grasses will require some care, including mowing once a year or burning every few years.

Everyone can help

You don’t need to have 1,000 spare acres to help bees and butterflies. Even devoting a few square feet of your garden—or even a few small planters—to wildflowers native to your area could make a difference, says Gibbins.

“When creating pollinator gardens, the most important thing is to have a big diversity of wildflowers and heirloom crops that bloom in the spring, summer, and fall,” says Stephen Buchmann, a pollination ecologist at the University of Arizona and author of The Reason for Flowers. (Buchmann isn’t involved in the 1,000 Acre Initiative.)

Buchmann recommends against using herbicides or insecticides, or, if necessary, applying them at night when bees aren’t active. Providing nesting sites for certain bee species can help, too.

“People think they’ll just plant the wildflowers and the bees will come,” he says. “And that’s true in some cases, but the smaller the bee is, the less far it can fly. Some can only fly a few hundred meters.”

Some species nest in hard substrates, like the bare ground (bees hate mulch, says Buchmann), or in holes that you can drill in adobe or earthen bricks. Others nestle in sand pits or dead wood that’s been tunneled through by beetles. And it helps to have mud and water on the premises. The Xerces Society has a handy how-to guide on creating homes for bees.

The 1,000 Acre Pollinator Initiative is still looking into funding for the next four years, and they don’t expect to see huge jumps in the number of pollinators immediately. But Cedar Rapids is confident it will help, and they hope the project will serve as a model for the rest of the country.

And if enough local businesses and private landowners get involved, there’s no reason to stop at 1,000 acres, says Gibbins. “There’s a big push to extend this initiative up to maybe 10,000 acres in Linn County.”",http://www.popsci.com/Cedar-Rapids-Iowa-save-bee-pollinator
"""Game Of Thrones"" Fans Have Raised More Than $130K For Emilia Clarke's Brain Injury Charity","""Game Of Thrones"" Fans Have Raised More Than $130K For Emilia Clarke's Brain Injury Charity",1.0,"HBO / Helen Sloan

A fundraising campaign for Game of Thrones star Emilia Clarke's charity SameYou has surpassed its goal of £100,000 (approximately $130,000) in two weeks, with donations pouring in around the world from more than 5,000 fans eager to thank the show's actors for their hard work.



Clarke, who played Daenerys Targaryen, founded the brain injury rehabilitation charity after having two life-threatening aneurysms while filming Game of Thrones.



The idea for the fundraiser — as well as a companion campaign in honor of Kit Harington, who played Jon Snow — was born on Reddit, specifically /r/freefolk, an active, irreverent community (with an incredibly strong meme game) devoted to the show and the Song of Ice and Fire books.



After learning of the fundraiser on May 30, Clarke made an Instagram post thanking fans for raising — at the time — £38,000 for her charity.



""I’m so incredibly moved and blown away and grateful,"" she said. ""[The fundraising campaign] has made my day, week, month, year, decade, and I couldn’t think of a more beautiful way to wave goodbye to the Mother of Dragons than with this step towards making brain injury sufferers feel less alone.""



But on Thursday, SameYou announced that the campaign had reached its goal of £100,000. The charity uploaded a video of a beaming Clarke lip-synching the song ""Simply the Best"" with a caption thanking /r/freefolk and campaign founder, redditor elle_ellaria.



The incredible support of Elle Ellaria, @reddit’s r/FreeFolk and Emilia’s fans worldwide means their campaign has raised over £100,000 for SameYou. Thank you so, so much. As Emilia says, you guys are simply the best! 🧡 #sameyoucharity

In an email to BuzzFeed News on Thursday, elle_ellaria, who asked to only be identified by her first name, Sarah, said that she never expected the fundraiser to raise so much money.



""I truly thought this fundraiser peaked around 35k, so seeing it hit 100k and keep climbing just fills my heart with joy,"" she wrote.



Sarah told BuzzFeed News that the success of these two campaigns is a testament to Game of Thrones fans and their enduring support for the show's cast, regardless of the mixed reactions to the final season. ""Every fandom,"" she said, ""[has people] who love to kill a good thing or veer the passion over into vitriol, but, by and large, the outpouring of love and support has been unmistakable.""



The SayYou fundraiser's success — and the recent news that Kit Harington, who played Jon Snow, had checked into a wellness retreat in the wake of the series finale — inspired another member of /r/freefolk to create a companion campaign so fans could donate to charity in honor of him. This second campaign is raising money for Mencap, a UK-based charity for which Harington is an ambassador that ""works to support people with a learning disability, their families and carers by fighting to change laws, improve services and access to education, employment and leisure facilities."" Harington has spoken previously about his cousin, who has a learning disability, and how their relationship inspired him to work with Mencap. In the week since its creation, the campaign in honor of Harington has received donations totaling more than £42,000 (approximately $53,000) from nearly 2,700 fans.",https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ellievhall/game-of-thrones-charity-fans-emilia-clarke-kit-harington
Muslims Raise More Than $180K For Pittsburgh Synagogue Victims,Muslims Raise More Than $50K For Pittsburgh Synagogue Victims In 6 Hours,1.0,"A crowdfunding campaign formed by two Muslim groups has raised more than $180,000 for the victims of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting, which killed 11.

Muslim-American non-profits Celebrate Mercy and MPower Change were behind the campaign, “Muslims Unite For Pittsburgh Synagogue.” It is also in partnership with the Islamic Center of Pittsburgh.

"Homeless people in California, Western states cannot be prosecuted for sleeping outside if shelter access is lacking, court rules","Cities may not prosecute homeless people for sleeping outside if they have no access to shelter, appeals court rules",1.0,"Prosecuting homeless people for sleeping on public property when they have no access to shelter violates the Constitution’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment, a federal appeals court decided Tuesday.

The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously overturned a district court decision in favor of the city of Boise, Idaho, in a case in which homeless people challenged two city ordinances that barred them from staying overnight on public property.

The ruling will protect the homeless not only in Boise but in California and other Western states from ordinances that punish them for being unable to obtain shelter.

The challengers, who had been cited under the Boise ordinances, sought damages and a court order barring the city from enforcing the laws.

After the litigation began, the Boise Police Department decided in 2010 to prohibit enforcement of the ordinances against any homeless person on public property on a night when no shelter had “an available overnight space.”

Police continued to cite homeless people on nights when there was availability in the shelters.

The 9th Circuit, though, cited evidence that some shelters limited the number of days a homeless person could stay or turned away people who arrived past certain hours.

Others required a religious commitment, the court said.

“A city cannot, via the threat of prosecution, coerce an individual to attend religion-based treatment programs,” Judge Marsha S. Berzon wrote for the court.

Even though the shelters had beds, some homeless people did not have access to them, the court noted.

Tuesday’s decision reinstated a 2006 9th Circuit ruling in a challenge to a Los Angeles homeless law. A settlement was eventually reached in the Los Angeles case, and the ruling lost its value as a precedent.

The panel hearing the Boise challenge said it agreed with the ruling in the Los Angeles case and reiterated that the homeless may not be held criminally responsible for sleeping on government property when no alternative shelter was available.

“The 8th Amendment prohibits the imposition of criminal penalties for sitting, sleeping, or lying outside on public property for homeless individuals who cannot obtain shelter,” Berzon wrote.

The court said its holding was narrow. It does not require a city to allow anyone on public property at any time or mandate that cities provide adequate shelter.

Rather, the court said, “as long as there is no option of sleeping indoors, the government cannot criminalize indigent, homeless people for sleeping outdoors, on public property, on the false premise they had a choice in the matter.”

In a partial dissent, Judge John B. Owens wrote that he agreed with most of the ruling but would have limited some of the plaintiffs’ claims.

Chicago pizza delivery woman moved to tears after church honors her with incredible tip,Local church orders pizza and tips single mother delivery woman over $1800,1.0,"This is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated. Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.

CHICAGO — A local delivery driver was brought to tears after being surprised with an incredible tip during a Chicago church service.

For the entire month of February, New Life Covenant Church, located in Chicago’s Humboldt Park, says they had been challenging members of the church to honor people.

On Sunday, Feb. 25, Pastor Wilfredo De Jesús ordered a pizza with the intentions of surprising, and honoring, the delivery person.

When Monique Hall arrived with the church’s pizza order, she was brought up to the stage by the pastor, totally clueless of what was about to happen. He then presented her with $100 tip.

In a video posted to Facebook Monday, Pastor Wilfredo then called for church members to join him, to also give Hall a tip.

As the tips continued to pile up in Hall’s hand, she became emotional from the overwhelming amount of people who came to the stage to honor her.

On Friday morning, Hall and Pastor Wilfredo joined WGN Morning News to talk about what that moment meant.

“I was nervous. I did not understand why so many people had stood up for a pizza delivery person,” Hall told WGN.

“I definitely wasn’t expecting it, but I knew that I had been struggling for a long time being a single parent, and not having their father in their life, it takes a real damper on you, especially trying to make ends meet,” Hall said. “So when they did that, I was overwhelmed and I was shocked. I felt so loved by them – all I could do was cry.”

Hall not only left the church with a basket full of tips, but she also left with a bible, a gift bag, and a prayer from the church led by Pastor Wilfredo.

“We want to let you know, here at New Life Covenant Church, that whether you have a church to worship in or not, we want you to know that you’re welcome here. You’ll always remember this day that you were marked by God. It could of been any other restaurant, any other person, but it was you,” Pastor Wilfredo said during the prayer.

Hall told WGN she made sure to spread the church’s message by sharing the tips she received with her coworkers.

“I felt like some of my coworkers were just the same as me, in the same place. So it was only right that I give to them, since I was given to,” Hall said.

These Indian fishermen take plastic out of the sea and use it to build roads,Indian fishermen are pulling Plastic from the Oceans to build roads and have removed 25 tonnes of plastic from the Arabian Sea in first 10 months.,1.0,"Every one of India’s 1.3 billion people uses an average 11kg of plastic each year. After being used, much of this plastic finds its way to the Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean, where it can maim and kill fish, birds and other marine wildlife.

Fisherman in India’s southern state of Kerala are taking on the battle to cut the level of plastic waste in the oceans.

When the trawlers drag their nets through the water, they end up scooping out huge amounts of plastic along with the fish. Until recently the fishermen would simply throw the plastic junk back into the water.

But last summer Kerala’s fisheries minister J. Mercykutty Amma started a scheme to change this. Under her direction, the state government launched a campaign called Suchitwa Sagaram, or Clean Sea, which trains fishermen to collect the plastic and bring it back to shore.

In Suchitwa Sagaram’s first 10 months, fisherman have removed 25 tonnes of plastic from the Arabian Sean, including 10 tonnes of plastic bags and bottles, according to a UN report on the scheme.

From waste to roads

Once all the plastic waste caught by the Keralan fishermen reaches the shore, it is collected by people from the local fishing community - all but two of whom are women - and fed into a plastic shredding machine.

Like so many of India’s plastic recycling schemes, this shredded plastic is converted into material that is used for road surfacing.



There are more than 34,000km of plastic roads in India, mostly in rural areas. More than half of the roads in the southern state of Tamil Nadu are plastic. This road surface is increasingly popular as it makes the roads more resilient to India’s searing heat. The melting point for plastic roads is around 66°C, compared to 50°C for conventional roads.

Using recycled plastic is a cheaper alternative to conventional plastic additives for road surfaces. Every kilometre of plastic road uses the equivalent of a million plastic bags, saving around one tonne of asphalt. Each kilometre costs roughly 8% less than a conventional road.

And plastic roads help create work. As well as the Keralan fishing crews, teams of on-land plastic pickers across India collect the plastic waste. They sell their plastic to the many small plastic shredding businesses that have popped up across the country.

Plastics ban

The need for schemes such as Suchitwa Sagaram is emphasised by research that shows 90% of the plastic waste in the world’s oceans is carried there by just 10 rivers - two of which are in India.

According to a study by the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research, India’s Indus and Ganges rivers carry the second and sixth highest amounts of plastic debris to the ocean. The Indian Ocean, meanwhile, is choked with the second highest amount of plastic out of all of the world’s oceans.

Like Kerala’s fisheries minister, Indian politicians appear to be taking action in the face of this mounting crisis.

This month India’s prime minister Narendra Modi pledged to eliminate all single-use plastic in the country by 2022, starting with an immediate ban in urban Delhi.

The move came just three months after India’s western state of Maharashtra issued a ban virtually all types of plastic bag, disposable cutlery, cups and dishes, as well as plastic containers and packaging.

Residents face fines from 5,000 rupees (US$73) for a first time offence to 25,000 rupees ($367) and jail time for repeat offenders, while the state’s Environment Department is also encouraging people to recycle bottles and milk bags through a buy-back scheme.

While’s India’s plastic problem is substantial due to the size of its population and its rate of economic growth, schemes such as those in Maharashtra, Delhi and Kerala set an example to western nations.

In the US, for example each person on average generates up to 10 times the amount of plastic waste generated by their Indian counterpart.",https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/06/these-indian-fishermen-take-plastic-out-of-the-sea-and-use-it-to-build-roads
Tennessee becomes first state in the South with hate crime law protecting transgender people,Tennessee becomes first state in the South with hate crime law protecting transgender people,1.0,"Tennessee has become the first state in the South with a hate crime statute protecting transgender individuals.

State Attorney General Herbert Slatery issued an opinion Feb. 8 in response to a question posed by Rep. Mike Stewart, D-Nashville.

""A defendant who targets a person for a crime because that person is transgender has targeted the person because of his or her gender within the meaning"" of the current state law that outlines sentence enhancements for hate crimes, Slatery wrote.

Tennessee does not have an explicit hate crime charge, though the General Assembly in 2000 added a hate crime factor to judges' sentencing rules for crimes targeting a person based on race, religion, color, disability, sexual orientation, national origin, ancestry or gender.

Slatery's decision affirms that transgender individuals should be covered under the existing law, but must still be tested in court in a case involving bias against a transgender victim.

Stewart sought clarification from Slatery on whether transgender people would be covered after a discussion last year in a Senate committee regarding a bill filed by Sen. Sara Kyle, D-Memphis, to add gender identity and expression to Tennessee's hate crime sentencing law.

The bill failed to move but raised the question about whether transgender individuals are already included under the gender protection.

Stewart said that in light of the attorney general's opinion, he would take a wait-and-see approach before suggesting that the legislature alter the statute or develop an explicit hate crime charge.

""Let's see how the courts actually utilize the law in practice and let's see how much protection it provides,"" Stewart said.

Authorities in Cookeville in 2016 said they would not investigate as a hate crime a case that involved a transgender woman's truck being set on fire after someone wrote ""Trump"" on the vehicle's hood.

The Putnam County Sheriff's Office said at the time that the vandalism did ""not fit the criteria of a hate crime.""

Chris Sanders, executive director of the Tennessee Equality Project, an LGBTQ rights advocacy organization, said they worked with Stewart to seek the opinion.

""What we as a community were all telling ourselves was nothing could be done in Tennessee as far as a penalty enhancement, if the perpetrator were even caught,"" Sanders, said of the 2016 case.

He said he is pleased with Slatery's ruling and is hopeful that it will be applied as future cases involving transgender victims move forward with sentencing.

In addition to hate crime sentencing enhancement, in Tennessee, certain hate crimes can be prosecuted as a felony under the Civil Rights Intimidation Act, a statute violation that can be difficult to prove.

Students in Baarali began dropping out as they had to trek through 3km of forest area.

news Human Interest

For students of Baarali village in Udupi district’s Brahmavar taluk, Rajaram is not just their science and mathematics teacher but also the one person, who ensured that they did not drop out of school.

The students in Baarali and surrounding villages began dropping out of the Baarali Government Higher Primary School over a year ago as the children had to trek through 3-km of forest area to reach the school.

“There are no roads from the houses of the children to the school. There is a mud path through the forest and most of the girl students began dropping out as their families were scared of allowing their children to walk for a total of 6 km to and from school,” Rajaram says.

Saddened by the state of affairs, Rajaram reached out to one of the school’s former students – Vijay Hegde, who runs a property management company in Bengaluru.

“The children were dropping out quickly and with the head count in our school falling low, we were at the threat of shutting down too. One evening, I had finished counting how many children had dropped out and I was upset. Every week at least five to six students were not turning up. I called up one of our former students – Vijay Hegde and proposed the idea of buying a bus to pick up and drop the children,” Rajaram says.

Around six months ago, Vijay Hegde, another alumna of the school Ganesh Shetty and Rajaram pooled in money and bought a bus for the school. Appointing a driver would have cost Rajaram at least Rs 7,000, which he could not afford, so he decided to drive the bus himself.

“I live on the meagre salary of a government school teacher. I could not afford to pay for a driver. Hence, I decided that I would learn how to drive the bus and do the task myself,” he adds.

Rajaram also got himself a license to drive the bus and he began the pick-up and drop service for the students. Once the pick-up and drop facility began, the school’s strength increased from 50 to 90.

Every morning, Rajaram leaves home early in the morning and completes four pick-up trips by 9.20 am.

“The school starts at 9.30 am and I make sure that all students are on time. There are three teachers including me and a headmistress in our school. One of the teachers comes to school before the students from the first trip reach school. The teachers stay back in school until all the students are dropped off and I come back to park the bus,” Rajaram says.

Rajaram spends money from his own pocket on vehicle insurance and diesel for the bus. Now, he wants to construct a track for the school so the students can practice 100 m and 200 m sprints for track events.

“I am thinking of constructing a fence around the school and also a track so children can practise sports. The problem is I don’t have enough money. I have reached out to the alumni of the school and asked if they will help. So far, there is money trouble but I am sure we will surpass that hurdle as well. The children will be motivated to attend classes if there are sports and other activities,” Rajaram added.",https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/udupi-teacher-buys-bus-turns-driver-all-ensure-students-don-t-drop-out-school-84350
"Former Slave, Two-Time Olympian Becomes an Airman","Former slave escaped to US, went on to compete twice in the Olympics, joins Air Force to give back",1.0,"After enduring countless hardships and overcoming unimaginable obstacles, Airman 1st Class Guor Maker, a dental assistant currently in technical training, found his way out of war-torn South Sudan, Africa and into the U.S. nearly 20 years ago.

Surviving

As one of roughly 20,000 children uprooted by the gruesome Second Sudanese Civil War, Maker's childhood was far from normal. After losing 28 family members, including eight of his nine siblings, 8-year-old Maker set out on foot from South Sudan to live with his uncle.

""The country I came from was torn apart by war,"" said Maker. ""It was all I knew growing up, nothing else. I've seen people die in front of me, but I knew no matter what, I had to make it.""

During his harrowing journey, Maker was captured and enslaved twice: once by Sudanese soldiers, and once by herdsmen.

""When I was captured, I was forced to be a slave laborer,"" said Maker. ""I would wash dishes or do anything else needed to get by. I slept in a small cell and rarely got to eat...but not always.""

Both times, Maker successfully escaped from enslavement and was finally able to join his uncle in Khartoum after three perilous years. However, his journey to safety was far from over.

During a nighttime attack on the perceived safety of his uncle's home, Maker sustained serious injuries when he was beaten unconscious by a soldier who smashed his jaw with a rifle.

""My mouth was shut for two months and I could only consume liquids because my jaw was broken,"" he said. ""We fled to Egypt after that, and the United Nations treated my injuries.""

After two years of filling out paperwork at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in Egypt, Maker and his uncle's family were finally granted permission to enter the United States.

""I was very excited to come to the U.S.,"" said Maker. ""Looking back at everything my family and I endured, it is a miracle that we made it out of there.""

Dreaming

When Maker first arrived in the U.S. in 2001, he settled in Concord, New Hampshire. Not only did he want to survive, but he wanted to thrive.

""I wanted to change my life, help my parents back in South Sudan, and give my future children a better childhood than the one I had,"" he said. ""And the only way to do that was through education and determination.""

Maker started with the basics and began learning English by watching children's cartoons and spending plenty of time with other high school kids just listening to their conversations and absorbing all that he could.

""Within a short amount of time, I was able to communicate with effectively with other students and teachers, order food, and really get by on my own,"" Maker said.

While learning English was a crucial step on his personal journey, Maker's high school career really took off when one of his teachers introduced him to running.

""Running was always just natural and easy for me,"" said Maker. ""It was a great high school experience and it helped me meet a lot of friends, build confidence and it was genuinely fun.""

After winning the National High School indoor two-mile title, Maker received a scholarship to compete at Iowa State University, where he allowed himself to dream of things that had never been done before.

""When I got to college in 2005, I remember hanging a piece of paper on my wall that said I was going to run in the Olympics in 2012 for South Sudan,"" said Maker. ""I thought 'Why not me? Why can't I do it?'""

Maker graduated with a bachelor's degree in Chemistry and reached All-American status as a student athlete, Ready to start his new life. Maker planned to head to Flagstaff, Arizona to train for the 2012 Olympics.

The same day he left for Arizona in 2011 was the day South Sudan officially gained its independence.

""I drove the whole way celebrating and it was a very special day that I will always remember,"" said Maker.

Following his year of training, Maker qualified to run the marathon in the 2012 Olympics in London.

Even though South Sudan officially gained its independence, the country was not yet a member of the International Olympic Committee and Maker was still not an official U.S. citizen.

""State senators from New Hampshire and Arizona presented my case to the Senate in Washington D.C. so the International Olympic Committee allowed me to run in the Olympics without a country,"" said Maker.

Even though his dream of running for South Sudan had not yet come true, Maker accomplished a great deal as an unaffiliated Olympian.

""All of the people in South Sudan knew where I was from,"" said Maker. ""I wanted to be the inspiration for the children to say, 'Hey, if Maker can do it, you know what, I can do it too.'""

After the 2012 Olympics, Maker was undeterred and set a new goal for himself and his country.

""I said to myself, 'In 2016, I'm going to bring South Sudan to the Olympics for the first time,'"" said Maker. ""I wanted to try to do more for my country and the 2012 Olympics only strengthened my conviction to accomplish my goal.""

This time around Maker's dream became a reality in Rio de Janeiro 2016 when he became one of three athletes to be the first to represent South Sudan in an Olympic games, as well as South Sudan's flag bearer for the opening ceremony.

""Walking into that stadium, carrying the South Sudan flag was just indescribable,"" said Maker. ""The people of South Sudan were in my mind the whole time I was running into the stadium with that flag and it meant so much to me.""

While it was a truly incredible and improbable moment for Maker, his thoughts were filled with the people of his home country while he was running with that flag.

""Over 50 years of civil war and my country finally got independence,"" said Maker. ""So many lives were lost for our freedom, it was just ringing in my head that we have done it, we have done it. On that day, everyone in South Sudan was at peace watching the Olympics for the first time.""

The 2016 Olympics were an enormous accomplishment for the former slave and South Sudan native that went far beyond his 82nd overall finish.

""I couldn't have accomplished any of it without all the support I received from my family and the opportunity the United States gave me. It's the highlight of my athletic career so far and a moment I'll treasure forever.""

Serving

The next chapter in Maker's life began when he decided to join the U.S. Air Force to serve the country that gave him so many opportunities.

""All of the things I've accomplished have derived from the opportunities the U.S. has afforded me,"" said Maker. ""When I first came to America, I didn't have hardly anything, but with the support and opportunity this country has given me, I've been able to completely change my life.""

The staff at basic military training had no idea who Maker was, but he quickly stood out to leadership at the 324th Training Squadron.

""I went out to the track and saw the instructors were putting their attention on one trainee in particular,"" said Maj. John Lippolis, director of operations for the 324th TRS. ""I could see him running noticeably faster than everyone else and the instructors explained to me that we had a two-time Olympian at BMT.""

In addition to Maker's Olympian status, his unique personal story also stood out Lippolis.

""I was just absolutely floored when I talked to him about what he went through to get to where he is today,"" said Lippolis. ""Not only did he get survive, he wanted to better himself and he has accomplished so much.

Reddit Users Rally For Marvel Fan Battling Cancer To See 'Avengers: Endgame' Early,Redditors of the Marvel Studios subreddit are trying to start a Campaign to allow a fellow redditor who is terminally ill to see an early Screening of Avengers: Endgame,1.0,"Earlier today, Reddit began to rally around a member of /r/MarvelStudios who's been battling cancer. Reddit member /u/alexander_q posted earlier today that he's suffering from three types of cancer and the Marvel Studios subreddit instantly banded together in hopes of getting him an early screening of Avengers: Endgame.

Jumping to the top of /r/MarvelStudios, alexander_q posted he's suffering from cancer of the liver and mouth in addition to bone marrow failure. In response, the post has started being passed around various circles in hopes that it gets noticed by either Joe and Anthony Russo — directors behind Endgame — or Marvel Studios boss Kevin Feige.

""I'm not a child or anyone with a particularly tragic story,"" Alexander detailed in his post. ""Just a normal guy. I'm 33, lost my sister three years ago to the same rare genetic disease it turns out I have too. I'll behind a devoted girlfriend and an adopted greyhound.""

The post has attracted enough attention so far that a vendor working on visual effects for the movie has shared they'll do everything in their power to escalate the post up the VFX food chain.

""I'm currently working on Endgame in London,"" /u/Tinoh revealed. ""And will try and pass this message up the VFX ladder.""

Tinoh went on to offer alexander_q his cast and crew screening ticket to the premiere of Avengers: Endgame, typically held a week or so prior to its release date. Also in the thread, fans are trying to put together an organized effort on Twitter using the #Avengers4Alexander hashtag.

Marvel Studios and Disney have previously demonstrated going out of there way to accommodate the final wishes of fans before. It's just a matter of fans giving the right push to bring the situation to light in front of the right executives at Disney.

Our thoughts are with Alexander and his family during this time.

Avengers: Endgame stars Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man), Chris Evans (Captain America), Josh Brolin (Thanos), Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow), Chris Hemsworth (Thor), Jeremy Renner (Hawkeye), Brie Larson (Captain Marvel), Danai Gurira (Okoye), Evangeline Lilly (The Wasp), Paul Rudd (Ant-Man), Karen Gillan (Nebula), Mark Ruffalo (Hulk), Don Cheadle (War Machine), Bradley Cooper (Rocket Raccoon).

"New York City bans foam containers, coffee cups and more in landmark legislation","New York City bans foam containers, coffee cups and more in landmark legislation",1.0,"New York City is taking a stand against foam.

The nation’s largest city has officially banned foam containers, coffee cups and packing peanuts, among other items made from expanded polystyrene, New York Magazine reported.

The legislation, which was first approved by lawmakers in 2013, went into effect on Tuesday. The delay was largely a result of the city's restaurant industry, which filed a lawsuit in an attempt to prevent the so-called “foam ban"" because it is made of a low-cost material. Those against the ban also argued expanded polystyrene could possibly be recycled, according to the publication. However, the ban was approved by a judge in June.

The city’s department of sanitation says online that businesses across New York City have until June 30 to dispose of their plastic foam items or they could face fines up to $1,000.

“For our planet’s future, New York City is kicking off 2019 as a styrofoam-free town!” New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Twitter.

That said, some business are exempt from the foam ban. Butchers who use the containers to store raw meat or fish will not be affected by the measure and non-profit and small business owners may also be exempt in some cases, according to New York Magazine.",https://www.foxnews.com/us/new-york-city-bans-foam-containers-coffee-cups-in-landmark-legislation
Students defrauded by for-profit schools to receive loan forgiveness,U.S. Students who were defrauded by for-profit schools will have their student loans eliminated,1.0,"Students who were defrauded by for-profit colleges will have their federal school loans eliminated, the Education Department announced on Thursday.

Why it matters: The change will eliminate approximately $1 billion in student loan debt for 72,000 borrowers who filed claims, AP reports.

Debts of students whose claims were already approved will be erased.

The department will also review backlogged cases and re-evaluate cases that were denied.

Students who received partial credits from these universities will also be reimbursed for any payments already made on the loans, again be eligible for federal student aid and have any negative ratings resulting from loan repayments removed by credit bureaus.

What they're saying: “A close review of these claims and the associated evidence showed these borrowers have been harmed, and we will grant them a fresh start from their debt,” said Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona, who is pushing to simplify borrower relief.

Viral Challenge #trashtag Persuades People to Pick Up Litter,People Are Picking Up Trash in Parks and Beaches for the 'Trashtag Challenge',1.0,"As online challenges go, #trashtag, which went viral on social media over the weekend, is a pretty wholesome one. Hundreds of people shared photos of themselves litter-picking in trash-strewn parks and streets on Saturday and Sunday, while calling on others to start cleaning up their communities.

The idea for #trashtag has been around for several years, with one company promoting the idea back in 2015 as a way to protect threatened wilderness areas.

But it gathered steam over the weekend, as users on Instagram, Reddit and Twitter shared dramatically different before and after photos of one wooded area where a man bagged up hundreds of plastic objects — accompanied with an invitation to find a place “that needs some cleaning or maintenance” and “take a photo when you have done something about it.”

The idea soon spread, with some social media users incorporating “trashtag” into their weekend trips.

Others cleaned up in their local communities.

Many added a message explaining why movements like #trashtag are needed to protect natural landscapes.

The female calf was born in the early Friday. Kit, the calf’s mother, gave birth in the Watani Grasslands habitat, part of the zoo’s public viewing area, according to a zoo news release.

Before July 2, it had been 41 years since a rhino was born at the zoo, south of Asheboro.

Zookeepers described the calf as healthy and doing well. She is expected to gain 100 pounds a month in the first year and could weigh 3,500 to 5,500 pounds when fully grown, according to the zoo’s statement.

The zoo’s 40-acre Watani Grasslands expansion — completed in 2008 — was created for a breeding rhino herd.

The first rhino calf, also a female, was born July 2, one day after the zoo’s curator of mammals, Guy Lichty started his retirement. Lichty has been instrumental in leading the zoo’s rhino breeding program for 25 years, officials said.

Rhinos are pregnant anywhere from 16-18 months, according to the news release. A female rhino will only give birth every two to five years.

Is Katie Couric a Worthy Contender for Jeopardy Gig? Watch Wheel of Fortune's Pat Sajak Make an Unprecedented Blunder

Scott Kolbrenner of Encino, Calif., a contestant on Thursday night’s Wheel of Fortune, donated his $145,000 in winnings to be split between two charities.

Kolbrenner had amassed approximately $45,000 in cash and prizes during the regular rounds of play, before correctly guessing the bonus puzzle (watch video below) and collecting what turned out to be the $100,000 Grand Prize. In turn, he pledged $72,500 each to Uplift Family Services at Hollygrove and the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank.

“While I hoped I would do OK on the show, I never thought that anything like this could happen,” Kolbrenner said, reacting to his win. “I got lucky that day and knew right away that I wanted to share my good fortune. So, I decided to contribute all of my winnings to Uplift Family Services and Los Angeles Regional Food Bank, whose services support thousands of families. The fun and memories from the day will stay with me forever, but the urgent need in our community cannot wait.”

Kolbrenner has worked with Uplift Family Services, one of the most comprehensive behavioral health treatment providers in California, for the last 20 years and currently volunteers his time and serves as a member of the Board of Directors. The Los Angeles Regional Food Bank, meanwhile, sources and acquires food and other products to distribute to those experiencing food insecurity.

Microsoft will require suppliers to offer paid parental leave,"Microsoft will require suppliers to offer paid parental leave - In a move that could prompt more companies to offer paid parental leave, Microsoft is announcing today that it will require all of its U.S.-based suppliers and vendors with more than 50 employees to offer such benefits.",1.0,"In a move that could prompt more companies to offer paid parental leave, Microsoft is announcing today that it will require all of its U.S.-based suppliers and vendors with more than 50 employees to offer such benefits.

Why it matters: Many leading companies offer paid leave, but others need a push. History shows that when progressive companies require benefits or policies from their suppliers, it can help increase adoption. Microsoft's move alone will mean many thousands of new workers getting paid parental leave, as the company has more than 1,000 partners in the U.S.

Some states already have laws offering or mandating paid parental leave, including California. Microsoft's home state of Washington has also enacted paid parental leave that will go into effect in 2020.

""As we looked at this legislation, however, we realized that while it will benefit the employees of our suppliers in Washington state, it will leave thousands of valued contributors outside of Washington behind,"" Microsoft general counsel Dev Stahlkopf said in a blog post. ""So, we made a decision to apply Washington’s parental leave requirement more broadly, and not to wait until 2020 to begin implementation.""

What they're saying: Activists praised the move, with the National Partnership for Women & Families VP Vicki Shabo calling it bold and impressive. ""It showcases the ripple effects that state-level public policy changes — like Washington state's paid family and medical leave program adopted last year — can have in changing private sector practice and behavior,"" she said.

History lesson: It's not the first time Microsoft has required suppliers to offer specific benefits. Three years ago the company insisted that its partners offer full-time workers at least 15 days of paid time off each year.",https://www.axios.com/microsoft-require-suppliers-offer-paid-parental-leave-dc573198-123c-4c51-ab78-432863003165.html

Chile has created five sprawling national parks to preserve vast tracts of Patagonia – the culmination of more than two decades of land acquisition by the US philanthropists Doug Tompkins and Kristine McDivitt Tompkins and the largest donation of private land to government in South America.

The five parks, spanning 10.3m acres, were signed into law on Monday by Chile’s president Michelle Bachelet, launching a new 17-park route that stretches down the southern spine of Chile to Cape Horn.

McDivitt Tompkins, the former chief executive of the outdoors company Patagonia, handed over 1m acres to help create the new parks. The Chilean government provided the rest in federally controlled land.

McDivitt Tompkins has spent 25 years working on land conservation in Chile with her late husband Doug, who founded North Face and Esprit. Doug Tompkins died in a kayaking accident in Chile in 2015.

“This is not just an unprecedented act of preservation,” said Bachelet, who flew to this remote Patagonian valley on Monday to receive the donation. “It is an invitation to imagine other forms to use our land. To use natural resources in a way that does not destroy them. To have sustainable development – the only profitable economic development in the long term.”

The creation of the parks marks the latest in a flurry of environmental protection laws which have brought Chile to the forefront of worldwide conservation efforts.

Last month, Bachelet – who leaves office in March – completed a five-year negotiation with residents of Easter Island to form one of the world’s largest Marine Protected areas, which will protect some 720,000 sq km of the Pacific Ocean.

“President Bachelet is leaving behind a bold legacy of environmental protection,” said Maximiliano Bello, an advisor to the Pew Bertarelli Ocean Legacy program.

“This is more impressive because Chile is still a developing country, with a long history of development and exploitation of resources – in most cases over-exploitation. If Chile can take these huge environmental steps, there are few reasons why developed nations can’t act as well.”



After moving to Chile from California in the early 1990s, the Tompkinses spent hundreds of millions of dollars to purchase and “rewild” swaths of land.

The approach hasn’t been without controversy: some locals bristled at what they considered a clumsy American land grab. Loggers and ranchers complained that valuable land was taken, and the couple were also criticized for successfully agitating to prevent a huge hydroelectric scheme.

Relations have improved in recent years, with the handover of hundreds of thousands of acres to the Chilean national park service. McDivitt Tompkins has touted the ecotourism potential of a region of stunning beauty, with glaciated fjords, roaring rivers, snow-capped mountains and coastal volcanoes.

In the windswept Valle Chacabuco, the couple transformed a rundown sheep ranch into the world-class Parque Patagonia. First, they removed an estimated 25,000 sheep, then removed 240 miles of fencing and retrained former ranch workers as conservation workers. “All of us who love the earth can see how the threats to wild places and creatures are growing,” said Tompkins. “This is crucial work – it’s the work we’ve been doing for decades.”

Argentine’s centre-right president Mauricio Macri has praised the Tompkins model of conservation, which preserves wild land while bringing in tourists and related business to try to promote sustainable local development.

In December 2015, Macri accepted a donation of approximately 370,000 acres from the Conservation Land Trust and McDivitt Tompkins, and announced his support for the planned Iberá national park, a 1.7 million-acre wetland that is home to hundreds of bird species, giant anteaters and wild macaw parrots and includes a breeding program to re-introduce jaguars.

But opposition to conservation efforts remains strong in Chile’s controversial farmed salmon industry, which has been fighting efforts for greater regulation.



Last year, local ranchers briefly occupied one of the Tompkins’ parks in protest against what they see as the removal of productive lands from the local economy.

Patricio Ulloa, the mayor of Cochrane, the closest town to Parque Patagonia, rejected an invitation to the launch of the new park. “They have erased our history and there is no pardoning that,” he said. “That’s what we who were born and raised in this land of pioneers feel. They have never shown any evaluation that truly shows how this is going to benefit the community.”

President Bachelet’s conservation measures are one part of her progressive legacy that is likely to survive the country’s looming change of government.



Incoming president Sebastian Piñera – a billionaire businessman supported by an extreme rightwing coalition – has indicated his intention to reverse efforts to loosen the country’s draconian abortion laws and provide free university education to more students, but he is a keen supporter of the Tompkins conservation model.

In 2004, Piñera purchased an estimated 250,000 acres of wild lands on the Chilean island of Chiloe, which he converted into Parque Tantauco – inspired, he said, by the Tompkins example.

Florida man pays off lunch debts for every child in 9 schools,Florida man pays off lunch debts for every child in 9 schools,1.0,"This is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated. Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.

JUPITER, Fla. — $944.34 was the total outstanding lunch debt in all nine Jupiter area schools and one local man says that’s a small price to pay to make a big difference in a life of a child, WPEC reports.

“I went in there and I said ‘I want to pay off the lunch debt,'” Andrew Levy said.

When Levy learned that over 400 kids in his community couldn’t get a full meal in their school cafeterias, he felt he had to take action.

“These children that were in debt were going to either not eat or they would get just cheese sandwiches and I thought ‘that’s crazy,'” Levy said.

He had no agenda, no children in the district and no personal connection to the schools, but he knew he could make a difference, so he made it happen.

“Food is something that you shouldn’t have to think about. Children shouldn’t have to learn hungry,” Levy said.

After he paid the bills, Levy posted about it on Facebook.

Soon hundreds of people commented asking if they could contribute next time too.

Before he knew it, Levy’s act of kindness started a chain reaction across Palm Beach County.

“I even have had some clients over the past 48 hours say ‘You know something? I want to help. I want to give too,'” Levy said. “Every quarter, I’m going to do either a GoFundMe page or a fundraising page that can raise money every quarter so lunch debt never accumulates.”",https://myfox8.com/2019/10/13/florida-man-pays-off-lunch-debts-for-every-child-in-9-schools/
Drug Reverses Age-Related Mental Decline Within Days,Drug Reverses Age-Related Mental Decline Within Days In Mice,1.0,"A cryo-electron microscope rendering of an ISRIB molecule. Image by the Adam Frost lab

Just a few doses of an experimental drug can reverse age-related declines in memory and mental flexibility in mice, according to a new study by UC San Francisco scientists. The drug, called ISRIB, has already been shown in laboratory studies to restore memory function months after traumatic brain injury (TBI), reverse cognitive impairments in Down Syndrome, prevent noise-related hearing loss, fight certain types of prostate cancer, and even enhance cognition in healthy animals.

In the new study, published Dec. 1, 2020, in the open-access journal eLife, researchers showed rapid restoration of youthful cognitive abilities in aged mice, accompanied by a rejuvenation of brain and immune cells that could help explain improvements in brain function.

“ISRIB’s extremely rapid effects show for the first time that a significant component of age-related cognitive losses may be caused by a kind of reversible physiological “blockage” rather than more permanent degradation,” said Susanna Rosi, PhD, Lewis and Ruth Cozen Chair II and professor in the departments of Neurological Surgery and of Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Science.

“The data suggest that the aged brain has not permanently lost essential cognitive capacities, as was commonly assumed, but rather that these cognitive resources are still there but have been somehow blocked, trapped by a vicious cycle of cellular stress,” added Peter Walter, PhD, a professor in the UCSF Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator. “Our work with ISRIB demonstrates a way to break that cycle and restore cognitive abilities that had become walled off over time.”

Could Rebooting Cellular Protein Production Hold the Key to Aging and Other Diseases?

Walter has won numerous scientific awards, including the Breakthrough, Lasker and Shaw prizes, for his decades-long studies of cellular stress responses. ISRIB, discovered in 2013 in Walter’s lab, works by rebooting cells' protein production machinery after it gets throttled by one of these stress responses – a cellular quality control mechanism called the integrated stress response (ISR; ISRIB stands for ISR InhiBitor).

The ISR normally detects problems with protein production in a cell — a potential sign of viral infection or cancer-promoting gene mutations — and responds by putting the brakes on cell’s protein-synthesis machinery. This safety mechanism is critical for weeding out misbehaving cells, but if stuck in the on position in a tissue like the brain, it can lead to serious problems, as cells lose the ability to perform their normal activities, Walter and colleagues have found.

In particular, recent animal studies by Walter and Rosi, made possible by early philanthropic support from The Rogers Family Foundation, have implicated chronic ISR activation in the persistent cognitive and behavioral deficits seen in patients after TBI, by showing that, in mice, brief ISRIB treatment can reboot the ISR and restore normal brain function almost overnight.

The cognitive deficits in TBI patients are often likened to premature aging, which led Rosi and Walter to wonder if the ISR could also underlie purely age-related cognitive decline. Aging is well known to compromise cellular protein production across the body, as life’s many insults pile up and stressors like chronic inflammation wear away at cells, potentially leading to widespread activation of the ISR.

“We’ve seen how ISRIB restores cognition in animals with traumatic brain injury, which in many ways is like a sped-up version of age-related cognitive decline,” said Rosi, who is director of neurocognitive research in the UCSF Brain and Spinal Injury Center and a member of the UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences. “It may seem like a crazy idea, but asking whether the drug could reverse symptoms of aging itself was just a logical next step.”

Improves Cognition, Boosts Neuron and Immune Cell Function

In the new study, researchers led by Rosi lab postdoc Karen Krukowski, PhD, trained aged animals to escape from a watery maze by finding a hidden platform, a task that is typically hard for older animals to learn. But animals who received small daily doses of ISRIB during the three-day training process were able to accomplish the task as well as youthful mice, much better than animals of the same age who didn’t receive the drug.

The researchers then tested how long this cognitive rejuvenation lasted and whether it could generalize to other cognitive skills. Several weeks after the initial ISRIB treatment, they trained the same mice to find their way out of a maze whose exit changed daily – a test of mental flexibility for aged mice who, like humans, tend to get increasingly stuck in their ways. The mice who had received brief ISRIB treatment three weeks before still performed at youthful levels, while untreated mice continued to struggle.

To understand how ISRIB might be improving brain function, the researchers studied the activity and anatomy of cells in the hippocampus, a brain region with a key role in learning and memory, just one day after giving animals a single dose of ISRIB. They found that common signatures of neuronal aging disappeared literally overnight: neurons' electrical activity became more sprightly and responsive to stimulation, and cells showed more robust connectivity with cells around them while also showing an ability to form stable connections with one another usually only seen in younger mice.

The researchers are continuing to study exactly how the ISR disrupts cognition in aging and other conditions and to understand how long ISRIB’s cognitive benefits may last. Among other puzzles raised by the new findings is the discovery that ISRIB also alters the function of the immune system’s T cells, which also are prone to age-related dysfunction. The findings suggest another path by which the drug could be improving cognition in aged animals, and could have implications for diseases from Alzheimer’s to diabetes that have been linked to heightened inflammation caused by an aging immune system.

“This was very exciting to me because we know that aging has a profound and persistent effect on T cells and that these changes can affect brain function in the hippocampus,” said Rosi. “At the moment, this is just an interesting observation, but it gives us a very exciting set of biological puzzles to solve.”

Broad Effects Exemplify ‘Serendipity’ of Basic Research

Rosi and Walter were introduced by neuroscientist Regis Kelly, PhD, executive director of the University of California’s QB3 biotech innovation hub, following Walter’s 2013 study showing that the drug seemed to instantly enhance cognitive abilities in healthy mice. To Rosi, the results from that study implied some walled-off cognitive potential in the brain that the molecule was somehow unlocking, and she wondered if this extra cognitive boost might benefit patients with neurological damage from traumatic brain injury.

ISRIB didn’t just make up for some of the cognitive deficits in mice with traumatic brain injury – it erased them. “This had never been seen before,” Rosi said. “The mantra in the field was that brain damage is permanent – irreversible. How could a single treatment with a small molecule make them disappear overnight?”

Further studies demonstrated that neurons throughout the brains of animals with traumatic brain injury are thoroughly jammed up by the ISR. Using ISRIB to release those brakes lets brain cells immediately get back to their normal business. More recently, studies in animals with very mild repetitive brain injury – akin to pro athletes who experience many mild concussions over many years – showed that ISRIB could reverse increased risk-taking behavior associated with damage to self-control circuits in the frontal cortex.

“Added to this, Karen’s new results in aging mice are just amazing. It’s not often that you find a drug candidate that shows so much potential and promise,” Walter added. “This project also shows the power of the UCSF community – Susanna and I didn’t know each other and were living in different worlds until Regis Kelly brought us together, making this powerful connection that neither of us had realized before.”

“Amazing breakthroughs like this need more than the brilliance and experimental skills of Susanna and Peter,” said Kelly. “They also need donors like the Rogers Family Foundation willing to bridge the gap between great basic research and products that could be highly beneficial to society.”

ISRIB has been licensed by Calico, a South San Francisco, Calif. company exploring the biology of aging, and the idea of targeting the ISR to treat disease has been picked up by many other pharmaceutical companies, Walter says.

One might think that interfering with the ISR, a critical cellular safety mechanism, would be sure to have serious side effects, but so far in all their studies, the researchers have observed none. This is likely due to two factors, Walter says. First, it takes just a few doses of ISRIB to reset unhealthy, chronic ISR activation back to a healthier state, after which it can still respond normally to problems in individual cells. Second, ISRIB has virtually no effect when applied to cells actively employing the ISR in its most powerful form – against an aggressive viral infection, for example.

Naturally, both of these factors make the molecule much less likely to have negative side effects – and more attractive as a potential therapeutic. “It almost seems too good to be true, but with ISRIB we seem to have hit a sweet spot for manipulating the ISR with an ideal therapeutic window,” Walter said.

"Epic Games chief pays $15M to protect 7,000 acres of North Carolina wilderness","Epic Games chief pays $15M to protect 7,000 acres of North Carolina wilderness",1.0,"ZZT developer and Epic Games founder Tim Sweeney has reportedly paid $15 million to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to permanently protect 7,000 acres of undeveloped land in his home state of North Carolina.

This donation, earmarked as a ""conservation easement"" (which typically require landowners to forfeit the right to develop, subdivide, or otherwise interfere with the preservation of a natural landscape), is a nice example of how a successful member of the game industry might invest some of their wealth in a way that benefits others.

“It’s still in private ownership but the easement ensures it can never be developed,"" Sweeney told The Citizen-Times. ""It’s not open to anyone in the public at any time, but people can email and get a permission card and go and enjoy it.""

The region Sweeney has invested in is known as the Box Creek Wilderness; several years ago it came under threat of being subdivided to make room for the Rutherford Electric Membership Corporation to construct power lines, but Sweeney (who previously owned a smaller swath of the land) fought back in court.

This isn't the first time he's done this, either. Outside of his place in the game industry, Sweeney is recognized as something of a conservationist in North Carolina; the Epic Games chief reportedly began buying up land in 2008 and now owns roughly 40,000 acres in the state, some of which he has previously donated for conservation.",http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/285149/Epic_Games_chief_pays_15M_to_protect_7000_acres_of_North_Carolina_wilderness.php
The man who saves forgotten cats in Fukushima's nuclear zone,"A Japanese man in Fukushima has dedicated his life to rescuing cats and other animals that were left behind in the nuclear ghost city. Sakae Kato, 57, has spent the last 10 years in the nuclear zone to take care of these animals.",1.0,"FUKUSHIMA, Japan (Reuters) - A decade ago, Sakae Kato stayed behind to rescue cats abandoned by neighbours who fled the radiation clouds belching from the nearby Fukushima nuclear plant. He won’t leave.

“I want to make sure I am here to take care of the last one,” he said from his home in the contaminated quarantine zone. “After that I want to die, whether that be a day or hour later.”

So far he has buried 23 cats in his garden, the most recent graves disturbed by wild boars that roam the depopulated community. He is looking after 41 others in his home and another empty building on his property.

Kato leaves food for feral cats in a storage shed he heats with a paraffin stove. He has also rescued a dog, Pochi. With no running water, he has to fill bottles from a nearby mountain spring, and drive to public toilets.

The 57-year-old, a small construction business owner in his former life, says his decision to stay as 160,000 other people evacuated the area was spurred in part by the shock of finding dead pets in abandoned houses he helped demolish.

The cats also gave him a reason to stay on land that has been owned by his family for three generations.

“I don’t want to leave, I like living in these mountains,” he said standing in front of his house, which he is allowed to visit but, technically, not allowed to sleep in.

The two-storey wooden structure is in poor condition.

Rotten floorboards sag. It is peppered with holes where wall panels and roof tiles that kept the rain out were dislodged by a powerful earth tremor last month, stirring frightening memories of the devastating quake on March 11, 2011, that led to a tsunami and a nuclear meltdown.

“It might last another two or three years. The walls have started to lean,” Kato said.

Decontamination in fields near his house signal that other residents will soon be allowed to return.

He estimates he spends $7,000 a month on his animals, part of it to buy dog food for wild boar that gather near his house at sunset. Farmers consider them pests, and also blame them for wrecking empty homes.

On Feb. 25, Kato was arrested on suspicion of freeing wild boar caught in traps set up by Japan’s government in November. At time this article was published, he was still being detained for questioning.

Yumiko Konishi, a vet from Tokyo who helps Kato, said local volunteers were caring for the cats on his property, but at least one had died since he was detained.

FEAR LINGERS

About 30 km (19 miles) southeast, still in the restricted zone, Hisae Unuma is also surveying the state of her home, which withstood the earthquake a decade ago but is now close to collapsing after years of being battered by wind, rain and snow.

“I’m surprised it’s still standing,” the 67-year-old farmer said, a week after the tremor that damaged Kato’s house.

“I could see my cattle in the field from there,” she said pointing to the living room, a view now blocked by a tangle of bamboo.

Unuma fled as the cooling system at Tokyo Electric Power Co’s nuclear plant 2.5 km away failed and its reactors began to melt down.

The government, which has adopted Fukushima as a symbol of national revival amid preparations for Tokyo Olympic Games, is encouraging residents to return to decontaminated land.

Lingering fears about the nuclear plant, jobs and poor infrastructure are keeping many away, though.

Unuma, now a vegetable farmer in Saitama prefecture near Tokyo, where her husband died three years ago, won’t return even if the government scrapes the radioactive soil off her fields.

Radiation levels around her house are around 20 times the background level in Tokyo, according to a dosimeter reading carried out by Reuters.

Only the removal of Fukushima’s radioactive cores will make her feel safe, a task that will take decades to complete.

“Never mind the threat from earthquakes, those reactors could blow if someone dropped a tool in the wrong place,” she said.

Before making the four-hour drive back to her new home, Unuma visits the Ranch of Hope, a cattle farm owned by Masami Yoshizawa, who defied an order to cull his irradiated livestock in protest against the government and Tokyo Electric Power.

Among the 233 bullocks still there is the last surviving bullock from the 50-strong herd Unuma used to tend, and one of her last living links to the life she had before the disaster.

Her bullock ignores her when she tries to lure him over, so Yoshizawa gives her a handful of cabbage to try to tempt him.

“The thing about cattle, is that they really only think about food,” Yoshizawa said.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-fukushima-anniversary-pets-wide-idUSKCN2AV2XO
A Movement to Transform Coal Miners Into Beekeepers Is Great News for the Planet,A Movement to Transform Coal Miners Into Beekeepers Is Great News for the Planet,1.0,"Tucked inside an old gymnasium, hundreds of wooden boxes are stacked along a far wall. The space, formerly home base for a summer camp, is now host to labs and classrooms filled with bright, freshly painted blue boxes.

But children won’t be playing here this summer. Instead, among the boxes and stainless steel vats, displaced coal miners and low-income West Virginians will learn a new trade — beekeeping. It’s part of a program run by the Appalachian Beekeeping Collective, a program for low-income West Virginians to make supplemental income through beekeeping.

While beekeeping may seem like an odd choice for former coal miners, it’s a viable and increasingly popular way for people in rural areas to make money. In West Virginia, where poverty is high and jobs are scarce, a large part of the population is struggling to make ends meet.

Coal mining once bolstered the region, but between 2005 and 2015, employment in the coal industry decreased by about 27 percent, according to research by West Virginia University. Across the nation, states like Kentucky, Wyoming and Pennsylvania have to find jobs to fill the employment gap left by the coal industry.

Enter the Appalachian Beekeeping Collective. The collective operates across 17 counties in southern West Virginia and offers classes in subjects like, Is Beekeeping Right for Me?, bee basics and advanced beekeeping. It’s a branch of the Appalachian Headwaters, a nonprofit formed to develop sustainable economic opportunities across the region.

Interested beekeepers can take Beekeeping 101, which is a five-week course where they learn the basics of beekeeping, bee biology and solutions to common problems. Once the new beekeeper has completed this course, he or she can become a partner in the collective. The partnership offers training, mentorship, equipment and bees for free or at a reduced cost.

But the startup cost to becoming a beekeeper can be a barrier of entry.

This was the case for Jason Young, a resident of White Oak, West Virginia.

Young originally started beekeeping as a hobby but quickly realized it could turn into a small business. “We had decided that we wanted to move forward,” he says. “But it was really the money that was holding us back.”

When Young discovered the Appalachian Beekeeping Collective offered training and equipment at low cost, he leapt at the opportunity.

Young and his daughter enrolled in the free Beekeeping 101 course and received 12 hives from the collective for a reduced price. From there, he formed White Oak Bee Co.

Last spring was their first harvest. It produced enough honey for his family and his honey-roasted coffee, which is White Oak Bee Co.’s signature item. This season, however, he has 14 hives ready to harvest and hopes to make a profit that he can reinvest in the business.

“Beekeeping and our relationship with the collective has really made that possible,” Young says.

The Appalachian Beekeeping Collective successfully trained 35 beekeepers this past year and plans to train another 55 this spring.

When it’s harvest time, the nonprofit will process, market and distribute the honey for its beekeepers for free. That can result in a nice chunk of change. In 2018, the market value for a pound of honey was about $7.33. A single hive can produce 20 to 100 pounds of honey a year, which means a single productive hive could earn its owner over $700 a year. With multiple hives, a beekeeper has the potential to make thousands of dollars every year.

And the bees do more than produce income for their owners. The forests provide nectar for the bees, and in turn, the bees pollinate these key natural habitats and create more plant diversity, says Parry Kietzman, an entomologist and educator at the collective.

Kietzman says she’s noticed people are more aware of the land and plants once they have bees.

“It seems to give people more of a handle on environmental concerns,” she says. “Simply because they’re worried about their bees.”

For others, like Young, it’s a chance to accomplish goals.

“What I feel most thankful for is the opportunity to take some dreams we’ve had for a really long time,” Young said. “And to really see them, kind of, come to be.”",http://nationswell.com/west-virginia-coal-alternative-beefarming/?utm_source=social&utm_medium=contentshare&utm_campaign=atlasobscura
"Freddy the parrot makes it back to zoo after being stolen, shot and bitten by snake","An Amazonian parrot called Freddy Krueger has made headlines in Brazil after managing to find its way back to the zoo from which it was stolen while recovering from a four-year nightmare that saw it shot in a gun battle, abducted by armed thieves and bitten by a snake.",1.0,"An Amazonian parrot called Freddy Krueger has made headlines in Brazil after managing to find its way back to the zoo from which it was stolen while recovering from a four-year nightmare that saw it shot in a gun battle, abducted by armed thieves and bitten by a snake.

The turquoise-fronted Amazon parrot – whose Elm Street-inspired moniker stems from its bullet-disfigured face – was pilfered from a zoo in the southern city of Cascavel on the night of 16 April.

According to Brazil’s Folha de São Paulo newspaper, Freddy’s capture was just the latest in a series of misadventures to affect the Amazona aestiva bird.

Freddy was first brought to the zoo about four years ago, having been severely injured in a shootout between police and gangsters during a raid on the drug den where he had lived with his villain owner.

“In the shootout, [Freddy] was hit in the upper-beak … blinded and suffered burns to the feathers that grow between the eyes,” the Folha de São Paulo reported.

Freddy’s ordeal was far from over. Earlier this month, the parrot was reportedly bitten on the leg by a snake – thankfully of a non-venomous variety.

Freddy bled profusely but survived, only to be stolen days later when three armed raiders burst into Cascavel’s zoo, overpowered its security guard and made off with two parrots and a cylinder of gas.

Two days later, however, Freddy returned, discovered by zoo staff at the foot of a pine tree beside his cage.

The details of Freddy’s comeback remain murky, although drops of blood found near his former abode have fuelled speculation that the notoriously aggressive parrot bit his way out.

“He’s a bit of a wild one,” Ilair Dettoni, the zoo’s vet, was quoted as saying.

Dettoni suspected Freddy’s mangled features might have proven his salvation, given the limited market for deformed parrots. “I don’t know if Freddy is really unlucky or really lucky,” he said.

The second parrot and the gas cylinder have yet to be found.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/29/parrot-freddy-krueger-survives-kidnapping-shot-snake-bite-brazil-zoo
Hero schoolchildren who saved man trying to jump off bridge over A10 in Waltham Cross set for national awards,"Three schoolchildren are set to win national awards after stopping a suicidal man from jumping off a bridge, saving his life",1.0,"Sign up to our newsletter for daily updates and breaking news Invalid Email Something went wrong, please try again later.

Three heroic schoolchildren who refused to let go of a man trying to jump off a bridge and saved his life are set to be presented with national awards.

Devonte Cafferkey, 13, and Sammy Farah, 14, rushed to grab a man sitting with a rope around his neck on the edge of an A10 overpass in Waltham Cross on September 21 last year.

Friend Shawn Young, who was 12 at the time, called for help.

While trying to keep the man back and talk him out of suicide, he passed the boys his mobile phone saying “if it rings, don’t answer it”.

The boys were helped by 47-year-old Joanne Stammers, who is registered disabled with Klippel–Trénaunay syndrome, a rare disability that makes her highly prone to blood clotting.

Despite her condition, which prevents her from working, Joanne took over from the boys and held onto the man ""for what feels like forever"" and was left with bruising all over her arms.

Another man, James Higlett, did his part in saving the man’s life. All five will receive awards from the Royal Humane Society, a charity promoting life-saving intervention.

Shawn’s mum, Carol, has been amazed at the boys’ maturity and said they have “just got on with it” since their life-saving efforts..

She said: “I am extremely proud of all three of them, they are all good boys and it’s nice that they are getting recognised for doing something good in the community.

“Quite often in the national news there are a lot of negative reports about young people so it is nice to have something positive.

“They are very young and I marvel at how they are all dealing with it. Every time I speak to them I learn something new about what happened.

“For example, the man was passing out and got heavier for them, I didn’t know that until recently.”

Jacqueline Cafferkey, Devonte's mum, found out the good news a couple of weeks ago and described it as a “huge achievement”.

The three children, who go to St Mary’s High School, picked up Special Achievement Awards at the Broxbourne Youth Awards for their bravery.

Joanne described the award as a “great honour” and said she is still in touch with Jacqueline.

“It’s amazing to get this award, it’s obviously under sad circumstances but it’s also great that the kids are getting something for what they did,” she said.

“I am really pleased for them and I hope other children can see it’s worth stopping to help someone.”

Joanne, who was on her way back from visiting her mum in Waltham Cross when she saw Shawn calling for help, told the Mercury she “hates” going under the bridge now and avoids it when she can.

She still sees her mum once a week and pays special attention to any bridge she goes under now to make sure nobody is standing by the edge.

The heroes that day were nominated for these awards by Hertfordshire Police. A date for the awards presentation has not yet been set.",https://www.hertfordshiremercury.co.uk/news/hertfordshire-news/hero-schoolchildren-who-saved-man-1390011
Paris agrees to turn Champs-Élysées into 'extraordinary garden',"Paris agrees to turn Champs-Élysées into 'extraordinary garden', reducing car traffic by 50 percent",1.0,"The mayor of Paris has said a €250m (£225m) makeover of the Champs-Élysées will go ahead, though the ambitious transformation will not happen before the French capital hosts the 2024 Summer Olympics.

Anne Hidalgo said the planned work, unveiled in 2019 by local community leaders and businesses, would turn the 1.9 km (1.2 mile) stretch of central Paris into “an extraordinary garden”.

The Champs-Élysées committee has been campaigning for a major redesign of the avenue and its surroundings since 2018.

“The legendary avenue has lost its splendour during the last 30 years. It has been progressively abandoned by Parisians and has been hit by several successive crises: the gilets jaunes, strikes, health and economic,” the committee said in a statement welcoming Hidalgo’s announcement.

“It’s often called the world’s most beautiful avenue, but those of us who work here every day are not at all sure about that,” Jean-Noël Reinhardt, the committee president said in 2019.

“The Champs-Élysées has more and more visitors and big-name businesses battle to be on it, but to French people it’s looking worn out.”

The committee held a public consultation over what should be done with the avenue. The plans include reducing space for vehicles by half, turning roads into pedestrian and green areas, and creating tunnels of trees to improve air quality.

The Champs-Élysées’ name is French for the mythical Greek paradise, the Elysian Fields. It was originally a mixture of swamp and kitchen gardens.

André Le Nôtre, Louis XIV the Sun King’s gardener, first designed the wide promenade lined with a double row of elm trees on each side, called the Grand Cours.

It was renamed the Champs-Élysées in 1709 and extended, and by the end of the century had become a popular place to walk and picnic.

Paris celebrated the 1944 liberation from Nazi occupation on the Champs-Élysées and World Cup victories still bring out the crowds, but its famous charm has faded and it is mostly shunned by Parisians.

Today it is famous for its expensive cafes, luxury shops, high-end car salesrooms, commercial rents among the highest in the world and the annual Bastille Day military parade.

Before the Covid-19 crisis halted international tourism, the architect Philippe Chiambaretta, whose firm PCA-Stream drew up the makeover plans, said that of the estimated 100,000 pedestrians on the avenue every day, 72% were tourists and 22% work there.

The eight-lane highway is used by an average of 3,000 vehicles an hour, most passing through, and is more polluted than the busy périphérique ring road around the French capital, he added.

Chiambaretta said the Champs-Élysées had become a place that summed up the problems faced by cities around the world, “pollution, the place of the car, tourism and consumerism”, and needed to be redeveloped to be “ecological, desirable and inclusive”.

The plans also include redesigning the famous Place de la Concorde – Paris’s largest place – at the south-east end of the avenue, described by city hall as a “municipal priority”. This is expected to be completed before the Olympic Games. The aim is to transform the Champs-Élysées by 2030.

Hidalgo told Le Journal du Dimanche that the project was one of several intended to transform the city “before and after 2024”, including turning the area around the Eiffel Tower into an “extraordinary park at the heart of Paris”.

Immigrant families pay tribute to Alex Trebek for helping them learn English,Immigrant families pay tribute to Alex Trebek for helping them learn English,1.0,"Fans of ""Jeopardy!"" all over the world mourned the death of longtime host Alex Trebek on Sunday, but one group shared a particularly special connection.

Immigrant families in the U.S. say watching Trebek, who was 80 and had hosted the quiz show for 37 years, each night helped them learn English.

Asmae Toumi arrived in the U.S. from Morocco when she was 9, not knowing a word of English, and she said watching American TV shows was a big part of learning the language. She credited ""Clifford the Big Red Dog"" for some of her progress, but she also spoke about the impact of game shows like ""Wheel of Fortune"" and ""Jeopardy!""

Asmae Toumi. Courtesy Asmae Toumi

""I remember just sitting there understanding absolutely nothing,"" she said. ""But I think the exposure to new words, just how things were expressed, just went such a long way.""

When she first got to the U.S., Toumi found making friends, expressing herself and asking questions to be nerve-wracking. TV shows like ""Jeopardy!"" helped her navigate pronunciation, expressions and nuance.

Trebek — an immigrant himself, who was born in Canada and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1998 — was a staple in her family, and Toumi described his daily presence in her living room as ""irreplaceable.""

""He was one of the first people I 'met' in this country,"" she said. ""I came here with my family. I went to a French school. He was sort of the first American man that I was exposed to. His kindness and his empathy and his sense of humor, those were all huge in my cultural understanding.""

Just last week, during one of Trebek's last appearances on the program, ""Jeopardy!"" winner Burt Thakur, who is Indian, told the host about the impact he had on his own family growing up.

""I learned English because of you,"" Thakur said. ""My grandfather who raised me ... I used to sit on his lap and watch you every day.""

Sam Bautista, whose parents immigrated to the U.S. from the Philippines, said she grew up watching her mom learn English from Trebek.

""Growing up, my mom was learning English as I was learning to speak as a human,"" Bautista said. ""My mom always had this concern that she wasn't using the correct words or her English wasn't proper enough.""

Beyond expanding her mom's vocabulary, she said, ""Jeopardy!"" taught her and her sister about fairness, competition and education. She got emotional as she reflected on her memories of Trebek.

""He was always the pinnacle of what success was,"" she said. ""I don't know if that success directly correlates to education and intelligence, but my mom was very adamant that my sister and I took our education seriously. He was always fair. He was always right — obviously, he had the answers — but he was always fair. He never made you feel stupid for being incorrect, and I think that was huge for us.""

Fans on Twitter also spoke about Trebek's impact on their families and their memories of watching the show with their loved ones.

""I think it's important to emphasize the impact that Alex Trebek had on immigrant families,"" one user tweeted. ""I, too, watched @Jeopardy with my grandparents, who didn't speak English. Alex gave them something to look forward to every day in an otherwise unfamiliar world.""

Others reflected on what Trebek meant to their parents who immigrated to the U.S. around the time he became the host of the show.

""For 30 years my immigrant mom has been watching #jeopardy and repeating the answers 2 seconds after Alex Trebek, in broken English, pretending she knew it all along, rolling her eyes at the contestants. She will be devastated. #riptrebek,"" another user wrote.

"How $1 million in medical debt was forgiven in Washington by KIRO 7, Jesse Jones","Seattle TV Station Pays Off Medical Debts for 1,000 people",1.0,"KIRO 7 and Jesse Jones have paid off $1.1 million of medical debt for 1,000 people in western Washington.

After hearing Washington state medical debt stories for an investigative report, we decided to do something about it. Our goal: buy as much medical debt as we could.

We spent $12,000 and purchased $1 million worth of medical debt owed by viewers in our region. And we are forgiving every single cent of it.

Click here for how you can help.

See the full story in text below -- and see the follow-up story about how viewers forgave ANOTHER $1 million in medical debt.

One thousand people will be getting letters in yellow envelopes that have a KIRO 7 sticker on them.

The letters will go out this week. We worked with a company out of New York called RIP Medical Debt. They made the purchase on our behalf and we do not know who is getting relief, so it could cover just one doctor’s visit or one test.

If you receive a letter from KIRO 7, please contact us. We would love to hear your story.

Millions of Americans face crushing medical debt every day.

It’s the number one cause for bankruptcy in the country.

Joelle Craft of Seattle has multiple sclerosis.

“I was 16 when I was diagnosed,” Craft said. “Trust me, if my mother and I thought we had a choice, we would have said something right then.”

Craft said she will constantly have medical debt. She has already spent thousands of dollars for treatment.

“Every penny that I have goes to debt and survival,” Craft explained.

For a family in Yelm, medical debt begins at birth.

“My son was born and he was born prematurely, so he stayed at the NICU and it was his medical care for the cost of that,” mother Brittanie High explained.

High had a job and insurance when she gave birth to her son, Lincoln.

“My insurance switched over on Feb. 1, and Lincoln was born on Feb. 1,” High said.

But there was a billing mix-up between the provider and her insurance company.

“I literally handed my insurance card over. I don’t know what else I could have done,” High explained. “They keep saying they’re going to re-bill, but they never do.”

For two years, High has fought to get the $15,000 debt paid.

""I've had to deal with, you know, not only having a new baby, newborn, then adding on top of this medical debt, especially with a special needs son. It's just something that I don't think anybody should have to deal with, especially with having insurance,"" High said.

High and Craft are two of the 19 percent of all Americans who are in collections over medical debt.

In many ways, medical debt can live forever.

If you can’t pay it down, that debt can be sold. Collection agencies buy it for pennies on the dollar.

They’ll send bill after bill. If it’s not paid, the cycle continues.

Fewer pennies for them, and more interest for you.

“So does that mean if you can’t afford health care, you just don’t get to live?” Craft asked,

It’s how medical debt is sold that doesn’t help consumers, experts say. Medical debt can be sold multiple times. A $1,000 bill could be sold to a collection agency for as little as $10. However, the amount you owe can grow at 12 percent interest.

In six years, the debt almost doubles while the agency still pays $10.

“In some cases, we’ve found that interest starts accruing from the moment you walk into the hospital facility,” lawyer Lili Sotelo said.

Lili Sotelo is a lawyer representing consumers medical debt cases. Sotelo told us 40 percent of Americans have medical debt, and about half will end up in collections.

The bottom line: Medical debt is the No. 1 cause for personal bankruptcy.

Joelle Craft filed for bankruptcy six years ago.

""We are going to create a situation where people are afraid to go to the hospital or put off important and needed medical service because they can't afford it,"" Sotelo said.

“I passed off seeing my doctor regarding the cancer scares for over a year,” Craft explained.

“I (said) I couldn’t afford the colposcopy. I couldn’t afford another pap smear,” Craft said.

After repeated requests from her children, Craft went to the doctor and had lifesaving uterine surgery.

“I couldn’t say no to that surgery or I wouldn’t be here right now,” Craft said.

Craft contends just the fear of medical debt is deadly.

""I've got three kids,"" Craft explained. ""I can't say no to health care That's like saying no to them. No, you don't get to have your mom, cause, what? I don't have the money? To live? So, I'm in collections and it sucks.""

NEW YORK, NY – Staggering numbers of whales are being sighted off New York City shores as vastly cleaner waters have caused a 540% increase in the numbers of the massive mammals in just eight years.

Experts at the Rockaway-based non profit Gotham Whale started tracking sightings in the area in 2010 – counting just five. Last year, they spotted an awe-inspring 272, almost all humpbacks. The rise is monumental and points to the success of environmental policies such as the Clean Water Act, the Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act, Gotham Whale's founder said.

Paul Sieswerda, who worked as a curator at the New York Aquarium for more than 20 years before starting Gotham Whale, says lessening pollution in the Hudson River has also had a dramatic effect.

Artie Raslich/Gotham Whale ""So the Hudson River, instead of bringing out pollution to the areas we see whales – the lower estuary and the area right outside the mouth of the Hudson – it's bringing nutrients,"" he said.

Those nutrients feed tiny algae that attract the fish Menhaden - a major humpback food source that's known as the ""most important fish in the sea"" for the amount of other animals they feed, according to Pew Charitable Trust's Mid-Atlantic Conservation Project. Gotham Whales recently kicked off its ninth season partnering with American Princess Cruises, providing New Yorkers the chance to see humpbacks from May 4th to November 3rd.

""The sheer size alone is incredible,"" Sieswerda said of the whales. ""They're like buses, and to think that's a living animal and to think that is has the power and grace to completely jump out of the water when they breach is a spectacle that I think is unique to the animal kingdom.""",https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/whales-seen-hundreds-nyc-shores-drawn-cleaner-waters
"Navajo Nations first solar project now producing enough electricity for about 13,000 homes","Navajo Nations first solar project now producing Enough Electricity for 13,000 Navajo Homes",1.0,"Associated Press

A giant array of solar panels near the famed sandstone buttes of Monument Valley has begun producing electricity for the Navajo Nation at a time when the tribe is bracing for the loss of hundreds of jobs from the impending closure of a nearby coal-fired power plant.

The Kayenta Solar Facility is the first utility-scale solar project on the Navajo Nation, producing enough electricity to power about 13,000 Navajo homes.

The plant comes at a time when the area's energy landscape is shifting.

The coal-fired Navajo Generating Station near Page is set to close in December 2019, leaving a site that both tribal and private entities say has the potential for renewable energy development.

The Navajo Tribal Utility Authority, which owns the solar plant, said the project advances clean energy on the reservation long known for fossil fuel development, the Arizona Daily Sun reported.

Walter Haase, general manager of the tribal utility, said the plant proves to investors, developers and tribal communities that renewable energy projects are possible on the reservation.

Economic development often is hampered by the lack of infrastructure, required environmental clearances and consent from anyone holding a permit or lease for use of the land.

Before the solar facility, ""we had a reputation in the industry of not being able to get something built or brought online,"" Haase said.

The town of Kayenta benefited, too. The contractor hired and trained about 200 Navajos to build the plant, said Deenise Becenti, a spokeswoman for the tribal utility, leaving a qualified workforce for other projects.

The tribal utility avoided passing on the $60 million cost of the solar plant to its customers through federal solar investor tax credits, said Glenn Steiger, project manager for the solar farm.

A two-year power purchase and renewable energy credit agreement with the Salt River Project will cover loan repayments for the plant's construction, Steiger said.

The tribal utility is working on extending the agreement.

"China ban on ivory sales begins Sunday, aims to curb elephant poaching","China ban on ivory sales begins Sunday, aims to curb elephant poaching",1.0,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - A ban on ivory sales in China, the world’s largest importer and end user of elephant tusks, takes effect on Sunday with wildlife activists calling it a vital step to reducing the slaughter of the endangered animals.

FILE PHOTO: Ivory tusks seized by Hong Kong Customs are displayed at a news conference in Hong Kong, China July 6, 2017. REUTERS/Bobby Yip/File Photo

China has made a big push to eradicate ivory sales and demand has fallen since early 2014 because of a crackdown on corruption and slower economic growth.

Public awareness campaigns featuring celebrities have helped boost awareness of the bloody cost of ivory. Wildlife groups estimate 30,000 elephants are killed by poachers in Africa every year.

“It is the greatest single step toward reducing elephant poaching,” said Peter Knights, chief executive of the group WildAid.

China has allowed the sale of pre-convention ivory, which refers to products such as carvings and crafts acquired before the 1975 Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), as long as it is accompanied by certificates.

The trade in pre-convention ivory has been legally thriving in China and Hong Kong since 1975, and environmental activists have long asserted that it has spurred demand for all ivory.

The ban on all ivory sales has already led to an 80 percent decline in seizures of illegal ivory entering China as well as a 65 percent decline in raw ivory prices, said conservation group WildAid.

Under the ban, China’s 172 ivory-carving factories and retail outlets will also close. Some factories and shops started closing in March.

Illegal ivory supplies have also been rife in unlicensed shops and online across China.

This year, ivory prices in China were about 65 percent lower than 2014 levels, said WildAid, with retailers in some places trying to sell off stocks and offering heavy discounts before the ban.

The Chinese ban has been hailed by activists but they warn that Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China, remains a big obstacle to the eradication of elephant poaching.

China’s ban on sales does not apply in the former British colony, which has the largest retail market for ivory and has traded it for more than 150 years.

Hong Kong is a prime transit and consumption hub for ivory with more than 90 percent of consumers from mainland China.

Since 2003, Hong Kong has intercepted about 40 tonnes of illegal ivory, only about 10 percent of what is believed to have been smuggled in, WildAid said in a paper to the city’s legislature in May.

Hong Kong set a timetable for a ban on ivory trading last year, with a phase-out time of five years. A final vote on the ban is expected in the city’s legislature in early 2018.

Conservationist Zhou Fei said the Chinese ban could be a catalyst for the closure of ivory markets across Asia.

However, Kenya-based conservation group Save the Elephants said this year that neighboring Laos has expanded its retail market more rapidly than any other country.

Eva Ramón Gallegos, a researcher from Mexico National Polytechnic Institute (IPN) was able to completely eradicate the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) in 29 patients.

This scientific achievement was accomplished through photodynamic therapy, a non-invasive technique that seems to be an efficient method to prevent malignant neoplasm, which is the second cause of death among Mexican women.

The scientists from the National Biological Sciences School explained that she has studied the effects of photodynamic therapy for 20 years and said she was treated 420 patients in Oaxaca and Veracruz with this method, as well as 29 women in Mexico City.

“During the first stage of the investigation, when it was used to treat women in Oaxaca and Veracruz, the results were encouraging. The treatment was also very positive when applied to women in Mexico City, which opens the possibility of making the treatment more efficient,” she said.

She also explained that besides eradicating HPV, the main cause behind cervical cancer, photodynamic therapy is also used to eliminate premalignant lesions of cervical cancer in its first stages. The results of her investigation show that she was able to eradicate HPV in 100% of the patients who had the virus but had no premalignant lesions, 64.3% in women with HPV and lesions, and 57.2% in women who had lesions but don't have HPV.

"She loved Washington's national parks, so she left them $1 million",Washington State’s three National Parks receive $1 Million donation from woman who loved the outdoors.,1.0,"TACOMA, Wash. — Washington state's three national parks are planning upgrades thanks to a $1 million donation from the estate of a woman who loved the outdoors, according to Washington's National Park Fund.

The recently announced gift comes from the estate of Bette Wallace, who grew up in Washington and later lived in California.

“On behalf of (Wallace's) trust it was our family’s honor to make this donation on her behalf to the Washington’s National Park Fund knowing it will be used for many projects including a combination of saving lives and supporting volunteer infrastructure in the parks,” Cheri Ryan, Wallace’s niece and the estate's trustee, said in a statement.

Mount Rainier and Olympic national parks plan to use the money for a computer dispatch system that will allow operators to monitor rangers in the wilderness. The aim of the system is to improve the safety of employees and decrease response times.

North Cascades National Park plans to use its share of the money to improve infrastructure for volunteers.

The newish restaurant, which opened in September 2018, is selling $1 Mother Flaming Tacos ""all day, every day, until the M.F. shutdown ends,"" according to publicist Amy Freshwater.

She's referring to the partial government shutdown, which began Dec. 22 and affects hundreds of thousands of federal employees nationwide.

Dallas Morning News reporter Dave Tarrant chronicled the struggles many federal employees in Dallas are facing.

Twisted Trompo's $1 M.F. Tacos are made with a choice of protein and come served on corn tortillas with onions and cilantro.

Federal employees who want a cheap taco need to show federal identification to receive the $1 deal.

Assam: SC orders demolition of NRL boundary wall for elephants,"""Elephants have first right over forest"" - Indian Supreme Court. Orders for demolition of wall that was blocking elephant migration corridor",1.0,"The Supreme Court of India on Friday dismissed an appeal filed by Numaligarh Refinery Ltd (NRL) and ordered demolition of the entire 2.2 km boundary wall blocking an elephant migration corridor in Deopahar Reserve Forest in Golaghat.

The apex court said that “Elephants have first right on forest”.

The wall became the eye of a storm in 2015 after a 7-year-old male elephant that had reportedly died of “severe haemorrhage” in May that year from violently thrusting against the wall.

The same year, environmentalists captured videos showing elephants trying to cross the high boundary wall.

The green crusaders then started demanding demolition of the wall built by the oil refinery. It was alleged that the wall and the refinery township were being built illegally in a “No Development Zone” declared by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF) in 1996.

In August 2016, the National Green Tribunal (NGT) ordered NRL to demolish the entire length of the wall within a month. But only a 289-metre stretch was demolished.

As per reports, the NRL challenged the NGT order, saying the entire wall need not be demolished as it is not a part of Deopahar Reserve Forest in Golaghat.

Gauhati High Court has stayed any further demolition of the Numaligarh Refinery Limited (NRL) boundary wall as ordered by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) last month.

The NRL claimed it had paid Rs 25 lakh to the State Forest Department, which will be kept in a separate bank account for restoration of the area and for the improvement of the surroundings adjoining the NRL complex and to reduce man-animal conflict especially man-elephant conflict.",https://nenow.in/north-east-news/assam-sc-orders-demolition-of-nrl-boundary-wall-for-elephants.html

KATHMANDU, April 20: The Nepal Army (NA) has lifted two tons of non bio-degradable waste from the Mt Everest region under its Mount Everest cleanup campaign.

The cleanup campaign was conducted as part of the Wildlife Week organized by the Sagarmatha National Park Office.

According to the NA, the cleanup campaign was started from April 14, 2019 in coordination with various governmental and non-governmental organizations. Earlier, the NA had also flown 2.5 tons of logistical supplies needed for the campaign to Namche from Kathmandu by helicopters.

After the on-site cleanup campaign was concluded, the army lifted a ton of non bio-degradable wastes by army helicopters to Kathmandu and handed the waste to Blue Waste to Value Company. The remaining one ton of the waste has been flown to the NA barraks in Okhaldhunga for treatment, according to a statement issued by the army.

The army in the statement also pledged to provide necessary manpower and machines necessary for the Clean Mountains Campaign which will be run till May 19.

Per a report on the ""Today Show,"" Garfield suffered pneumonia and kidney failure. His sister Stephanie Garfield Bruno told KABC-TV that four different parts of his lungs collapsed. He was unable to walk.

But with the help of physicians and physical therapists, he was slowly able to regain his mobility and returned home with a walker.

On the day of his release, the entire staff at Providence St. Joseph gathered for a round of applause to cheer on the man who survived coronavirus, after two months of hospitalization.

He still has a long road to full recovery, but Garfield hopes that people take the coronavirus pandemic seriously.

""The only thing I really am focused on right now is telling the story about how real this is,"" he told KCAL-TV.

South Korean court outlaws killing dogs for their meat,South Korean court outlaws killing dogs for their meat,1.0,"A South Korean court ruled for the first time that it’s illegal to kill dogs for their meat, a decision that activists hope will pave the way to making the controversial practice illegal, reports said.

Long shrouded in a gray area of cultural relativism, eating dogs has become a taboo in the country as younger generations gravitate closer to the Western belief that a pooch is man’s best friend, rather than a tasty delicacy, according to AFP.

Still, lawmakers have hesitated to outright ban the practice and have instead acted with weaker regulatory laws, such as hygiene regulations or measures that ban cruel slaughter methods, the outlet said.

“It is very significant in that it is the first court decision that killing dogs for dog meat is illegal itself,” according to Kim Kyung-eun, a lawyer with the animal rights organization Coexistence of Animal Rights on Earth.

She added the precedent has “paved the way for outlawing dog meat consumption entirely.”

Last year, CARE filed complaints against a dog farm operator and accused him of “killing animals without proper reasons,” as well as violating hygiene and building regulations.

Prosecutors ended up charging the man and he was convicted, which meant meat consumption could not be used as a legal defense to kill dogs. He was also fined about $2,700 and waived his right to appeal.

The decision was made in April but the details were only released this week.

CARE leader Park So-youn plans to continue tracking down similar dog farms and slaughterhouses across the country with the intent of filing similar complaints against them with authorities.

“Over the past decades, public discourse over dog meat consumption has shifted towards banning it,” she said.

“The dog meat industry will take greater heat because of the court ruling.”

Roughly 70 percent of South Koreans don’t eat dog meat, but only 40 percent of them believe it should be banned. The meat — boiled to tenderize it — is typically eaten as a summertime delicacy.",https://nypost.com/2018/06/21/south-korean-court-outlaws-killing-dogs-for-their-meat/

Rep. Doug LaMalfa (R-Richvale) kicks off his Monday morning town hall in Chico. (Phil Willon / Los Angeles Times)

“May you die in pain.”

That was the nastiest moment of Republican Rep. Doug LaMalfa’s early morning town hall in the Northern California town of Chico on Monday.

The wish was uttered by an older man who criticized LaMalfa for voting for the House GOP plan to replace the Affordable Care Act. He was also holding a pink sign that read “Lackey for the Rich!”

ALSO: LaMalfa says the Russia investigation is ‘a bunch of crap’

The open hostility and intransigence inside the Chico Elks Lodge came as the political divide in the country has grown more inflamed, with Trump’s election unleashing a wave of both liberal activism and conservative empowerment.

As a result, Washington’s deeply partisan fights over issues such as health care, immigration and environmental protections have followed members of Congress home, turning once sedate town halls into in-your-face venting sessions that in left-leaning California have Republican House members on the defensive.

LaMalfa stood his ground on stage as person after person ripped into him for his votes and positions on healthcare and climate change, as well as for his unyielding support for President Trump.

A few speakers asked LaMalfa to resign, including one dressed up as the “Wicked Witch of the West Coast.”

Most comments and questions during the hour-long town hall were fairly cordial, although they were laced with plenty of boos and catcalls.

Norma Wilcox, a retired nurse who lives in Chico, also questioned LaMalfa’s healthcare vote. Wilcox told LaMalfa the House plan would take away healthcare for millions of Americans while providing tax breaks to the rich.

“I am open to new ideas,” LaMalfa told her, describing the House GOP bill as a placeholder that everyone expected to be improved during negotiations with the Senate. (The Senate’s healthcare efforts now appear dead.)

But the Richvale congressman, who represents California’s massive 1st Congressional District in the northeast corner of the state, said he will support only a new healthcare program that provides affordable coverage to middle-class Americans.

LaMalfa said Obamacare is quickly become unaffordable and unsustainable, with premium costs rising and the number of insurance companies offering coverage declining.

“People across the board are being hurt by this,” LaMalfa said.

When shouts and boos rained down on him, he chastised the crowd saying, “I have the mic folks. Yep, boo away.”

Ann Sisney of Chico told LaMalfa that her son, William, died of an opioid overdose two years ago. She held up a picture of the 19-year-old, asked the congressman to take it, and told him more people will die if GOP leadership in Congress gets its way on healthcare.

“These are life-and-death decisions that you are making,” Sisney told him.

LaMalfa assured her that Congress was working to find funds to address the nationwide opioid epidemic.

The Republican congressman also raised the ire of the crowd when he was asked about climate change and the degraded air quality in this stretch of Northern California.

“I don’t buy the idea that man-made activity is responsible,” LaMalfa said bluntly.

The crowd of several hundred did include some LaMalfa supporters, though most stayed silent.

Ron Jones, 67, of Paradise said he’s been to a few of LaMalfa’s town halls and all have been dominated by his critics.

“Most of the time people want to ... complain,” said Jones, a self-described conservative, after the event ended. “The people who support him are quietly in the background.”

LaMalfa does indeed have a lot of support in the district that also overwhelmingly voted for Trump over Hillary Clinton in last year’s presidential election. LaMalfa won his last election by almost 15%, and though he has attracted a few Democratic challengers, the district is not considered a battleground for 2018.

Unlike many California Republican members of Congress, LaMalfa hasn’t shied away from holding town halls, though it’s rarely a pleasant experience for him. He held one in Nevada City in March and another in April in Oroville. No other California Republicans are scheduled to hold town halls during their August recess.

Near the end of Monday’s town hall, a woman criticized LaMalfa for inviting only Christian pastors to provide invocations at his town halls and other events, and urged him to include religious leaders of all faiths.

“If you want to have your own town hall, you can invite whoever you like,” LaMalfa told her.",http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-schwarzenegger-donates-100-000-to-1502746010-htmlstory.html

McNeil has been raising cash for a Montreal Alzheimer’s charity by skating for 19 hours and 26 minutes in cities across Canada to pay tribute to his mother Eunice, who was born in 1926 but died in 2013 after suffering from Alzheimer’s for 20 years.

He also skates in memory of AC/DC guitarist Malcolm Young, who passed away in 2017 after being diagnosed with dementia in 2014.

McNeil listens to AC/DC non-stop while he does so and so and CBC are reporting that after finding out about the story, AC/DC icon Angus Young has donated $19,260 (Canadian) to McNeil and asked that the cash be distributed to dementia music programmes across Canada.

McNeil tells the website: “It's funny how things work in the world, but rock’n’roll is such a powerful tool. This is AC/DC. This could open so many doors.”

As for why he listens to the band during the gruelling sessions, McNeil explains: “It's like touching an emotional lottery. You've got to understand, this is what's been my driving force.

""When I go out in these conditions, that's all I listen to because it's my tribute to Angus and the boys because I know they lost a big part of their family.”

The JustGiving page has now raised £1,413 - more than double its original target. - Credit: Archant

A Wisbech mum whose 13-year-old son was attacked and robbed of his Suzuki motorbike is thanking the “little angel” who set up a fundraising page which has raised £1,413 in a week to buy him a replacement.

Daniel Sobey-Harker launched a JustGiving page last Wednesday (25) after he read that the victim, who had saved for eight months to buy a £600 Suzuki, was kicked, punched, ran over and robbed – just three days after buying the bike.

The victim’s mum said: “I’ve been speechless.

“How one person that’s not related to any members of our family could put so much effort in for a child, who is really a stranger, is just amazing.

“We never thought about raising any finances because I was more concentrating on supporting my son.

You may also want to watch:

“You don’t really get many people around here doing things like this.

“Daniel is just a little angel. I think he’s doing it just because he’s a good, kind person. He’s gone beyond any expectations.”

Daniel, who lives in London, will travel to Wisbech to meet the boy and his mum in the next few weeks and buy him a new bike.

He is also going to take the boy shopping so that he can buy safety items with the remaining money.

“Seeing my son having hope and making him feel happier in this difficult time is just lovely,” the victim’s mum added.

“Although he still doesn’t feel comfortable being around people and is a little insecure. It could take a bit of time, but Daniel’s just given him a huge surprise.

Daniel, who set up the page with a target of £601, said: “It’s quite heart-warming how many people have come together to donate money.

“Because there’s a good amount of money left over, I’m going to go shopping with him to get him some safety bits.

“It’s something that shouldn’t happen to anyone, but for each of the two attackers there’s been 20 or more people wanting to help. He seems like a good kid.

“As a motorcyclist myself I know the joys of going for a ride and while it can be dangerous, the only risks he should face are ones faced on a trail.”

The attack happened near the Thomas Clarkson Academy (TCA) on Corporation Road at 4.45pm on Sunday (22).

Detectives are hunting the assailants, thought to be two men aged between 20 and 25.

The mother said her son had saved pocket money to buy the off road bike. She said he went out of the house and pushed the bike around Railway Road, Queens Road and Weasenham Lane before the attack happened.

She said when they were near the TCA two men started to walk towards her son.

"Work less, get more: New Zealand firm's four-day week an 'unmitigated success'","Work less, get more: New Zealand firm's four-day week an 'unmitigated success'",1.0,"The New Zealand company behind a landmark trial of a four-day working week has concluded it an unmitigated success, with 78% of employees feeling they were able to successfully manage their work-life balance, an increase of 24 percentage points.

Two-hundred-and-forty staff at Perpetual Guardian, a company which manages trusts, wills and estate planning, trialled a four-day working week over March and April, working four, eight-hour days but getting paid for five.



Academics studied the trial before, during and after its implementation, collecting qualitative and quantitative data.

Perpetual Guardian founder Andrew Barnes came up with the idea in an attempt to give his employees better work-life balance, and help them focus on the business while in the office on company time, and manage life and home commitments on their extra day off.

Jarrod Haar, professor of human resource management at Auckland University of Technology, found job and life satisfaction increased on all levels across the home and work front, with employees performing better in their jobs and enjoying them more than before the experiment.

Work-life balance, which reflected how well respondents felt they could successfully manage their work and non-work roles, increased by 24 percentage points.

In November last year just over half (54%) of staff felt they could effectively balance their work and home commitments, while after the trial this number jumped to 78%.

Staff stress levels decreased by 7 percentage points across the board as a result of the trial, while stimulation, commitment and a sense of empowerment at work all improved significantly, with overall life satisfaction increasing by 5 percentage points.

If you can have parents spending more time with their children, how is that a bad thing? Andrew Barnes

Helen Delaney, a senior lecturer at the University of Auckland Business School, said employees’ motivation and commitment to work increased because they were included in the planning of the experiment, and played a key role in designing how the four-day week would be managed so as not to negatively impact productivity.

“Employees designed a number of innovations and initiatives to work in a more productive and efficient manner, from automating manual processes to reducing or eliminating non-work-related internet usage,” said Delaney.

Andrew Barnes said he would take the results of the trial to the board to open up a discussion on how a four-day work week could be implemented long-term in his company.

“If you can have parents spending more time with their children, how is that a bad thing?” asked Barnes, who believes the new work model has the potential to profoundly impact society for the better.

“Are you likely to get fewer mental health issues when you have more time to take care of yourself and your personal interests? Probably ... if you have fewer people in the office at any one time, can we make smaller offices?”

New Zealand’s workplace relations minister, Iain Lees-Galloway, said the results of the trial were “very interesting” and he was keen to encourage businesses to trial new and improved work models.

“I’m really keen to work with any businesses that are looking at how they can be more flexible for their staff and how they can look to improve productivity whilst working alongside their staff and protecting terms and conditions,” Less-Galloway said.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/19/work-less-get-more-new-zealand-firms-four-day-week-an-unmitigated-success
Drone finds climber presumed dead on world's 12th largest mountain,Drone finds climber presumed dead on world's 12th largest mountain,1.0,"A missing climber who was presumed dead on the world's 12th highest mountain was rescued after being spotted by a drone.

Scottish mountaineer Rick Allen was attempting to climb to the summit of 26,401 foot Broad Peak in the Himalayas when he fell from an ice cliff.

Later, when he didn't return to base camp, ""a number of people had assessed the situation and come to the conclusion that I was not going to come back,"" Allen told CBS News partner BBC News.

Brothers Bartek and Andrzej Bargiel, the latter of whom was planning to beat a record for climbing nearby mountain K2 and skiing down it, were at base camp and had a drone with them to film their journey.

When, 36 hours after Allen first went missing, a cook spotted something that looked like a backpack in the distance, the Bargiels launched their drone to investigate. Through the drone's camera, they discovered Allen clinging to the side of the mountain.

A rescue team was deployed, guided by the drone, and Allen was returned to safety with only a few cuts and frostbite.

Allen told BBC News that he had previously found encountering drones while mountain climbing irritating, ""but this has changed my perception of them.""",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rick-allen-mountain-climber-found-by-drone-broad-peak-himalayas/
Muslims lend Christians hijabs to help them escape Isis in disguise,Muslims lend Christians hijabs to help them escape Isis in disguise in The Philippines,1.0,"Terrified Christians are escaping Isis militants in the Filipino town of Marawi by wearing hijabs borrowed from Muslims.

There are around 1,500 people trapped in the besieged Filipino city, which is about 60 miles south of Cagayan de Oro.

Almost 100 people have escaped on foot, while others have swum across the river. Medics tending those who have made their way out alive recounted the resourcefulness of those who fled.

“Some of the stories that stuck were Muslims helping protect Christian workers by letting them borrow a hijab,” said Dr Gioia Ancheta, head of the psychosocial therapy team.

The civilians face starvation, being held as human shields and are also under attack from bombing assaults by the military who are trying to oust the jihadists.

There are reports that some local residents are so hungry they had “started to eat their blankets”, according to local politician Zia Alonto Adiong, who is managing the relief and rescue efforts.

“Some residents are eating (cardboard) boxes. They just dip it in water to soften the material and eat it,” he said.

Islamic militants stormed Marawi three weeks ago, leaving 290 people dead, including 205 Isis fighters, 58 soldiers and 26 civilians. Mr Adiong said that residents reported seeing terrible carnage left by the fighting.

“Dead bodies, at least 100, scattered around the encounter area,” he said.

Lieutenant Colonel Jo-Ar Herrera said his security forces were edging towards the business area of Marawi City, which is under the control of the combatants who have sworn allegiance to Isis.

There are around 200 Islamist fighters who have taken up sniper positions, he said. “The battlefield is very fluid.”

US troops are located close to Marawi City but are not actively fighting Isis insurgents, a Philippines military spokesman said.

“There are some US personnel who are operating equipment to provide information on situation awareness to our troops,” Brigadier General Restituto Padilla told a news conference. “I do not know the exact number and the specific mission. They are allowed to carry rifles for self-defence. But they are not allowed to fight, they only provide support.”

"Vandalized cherry blossom trees in S.F. Japantown receive $30,000 in crowdfunding","The San Francisco Japanese Cultural Center recieved $30,000 in crowdfunding to replant the cherry blossom trees that were vandalized in SF Japantown",1.0,"“Spectacular.” That’s the word Paul Osaki uses to describe mature cherry blossom trees in full flower. “They light up the sky.”

So when a vandal destroyed two of the three cherry blossom trees outside the Japanese Cultural and Community Center of Northern California, methodically returning over three nights to snap every single branch, it felt personal to the center’s executive director.

First, Osaki was angry. Then, the more he thought about the violence of the act and the destruction of a beautiful, living symbol of San Francisco’s Japantown, he felt sad and disturbed.

“I considered it kind of an assault or an attack on our cultural heritage,” Osaki said, adding that the trees “were significant not just to the center, but to the Japanese culture. Cherry blossoms are synonymous with the Japanese culture.”

Now, they also represent solidarity. News outlets including The Chronicle picked up the story, and a Facebook note posted by the center about the vandalism received a flood of support. When the nonprofit started a GoFundMe campaign last week that promised “the cherry blossom trees will bloom again,” donations poured in.

Over the first four days, the crowdfunding effort received close to $30,000 in contributions, dwarfing its $5,000 goal. Other donors have reached out separately, offering to replace the trees, including one $10,000 gift before the campaign went online. More than 500 people have contributed, some from far beyond the borders of Japantown and San Francisco.

“These are people who don’t know who we are, they don’t know the organization, they probably have never come by,” Osaki said. “They just saw this story and felt compelled to want to help. We’re just overwhelmed with the support.”

Gabrielle Lurie / The Chronicle

There are other cherry blossom trees throughout Japantown — a third tree in front of the cultural center and others along Post Street and in Peace Plaza — but the two targeted were special.

They were planted to commemorate a visit to the center by the emperor and empress of Japan in 1994, only the second time the monarchy had visited the United States. They were also the first cherry blossom trees to be planted in Japantown after the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency tore through the neighborhood in the late 1950s and ’60s.

“When I was growing up, most of Japantown was dirt lots, like whole blocks, with chain-link fences around it,” Osaki said. “Redevelopment also took out whatever plants or trees were planted by the first generation of Japanese.”

It took 17 months of planning and construction to get the pair of cherry blossom trees planted outside the center, where Osaki said they fit in with the building’s façade and had grown to 12 or 15 feet tall over 20-plus years. A third tree in front of the center was similarly damaged two years ago.

The community response to the trees’ destruction has been a bright spot during a tough year. In March, the Japanese Cultural and Community Center shut down with the rest of the city, and it has yet to reopen; its income from activities and events has vanished as the pandemic continues. Throughout the neighborhood, small businesses are struggling to stay afloat.

“It’s been incredibly difficult. Most of Japantown’s restaurants and stores rely an awful lot on tourism dollars,” Osaki said. For the last 10 months, tourists have been largely absent.

Paul Chinn / The Chronicle 2017

The cultural center has been using grant money to help small businesses, “but it’s nothing compared to what they need,” Osaki said. He knew of several that had already closed and others that are teetering on the edge. A lot are in jeopardy because of the rent they owe, he said.

Losing even a portion of the mom-and-pop ramen spots and gift shops that draw Bay Area residents and out-of-town visitors to Japantown could have a reverberating effect on the historic area.

“We’re a small community,” Osaki said. “Even if you lose 15 or 20 businesses, it’s going to have a huge impact on Japantown.”

Over the summer, the center created a program called Picnic in the Plaza, with tables and canopies and socially distanced seating for 200, an effort to revitalize the dining scene and draw customers back to the neighborhood.

Open on Saturdays and Sundays, the area drew 30,000 people before shutting down in November, Osaki said. “It brought life back to Japantown. You started to see people come by.”

Now, he’s looking to the cherry blossom trees as a symbol of hope for the future. Although Osaki doesn’t yet know how much it will cost to tear up the sidewalk and remove the damaged trunks, using the money from the GoFundMe campaign and other contributions, he hopes to have new trees planted by spring so they can bloom along with the rest of the neighborhood’s cherry blossoms.

In addition to replacing the pair that was vandalized, Osaki would like to add a fourth tree outside the cultural center along with some kind of decorative barrier to protect the trees from future damage.

“Having that finished — all the trees up and some kind of design that creatively brings it all together — would really help commemorate this outpouring of support that we’ve gotten from all over the place,” Osaki said. “That’s something we want to always remember. That will be part of the story of the Japanese Cultural and Community Center.”

Senate Passes Bill to Protect Sea Turtles, Whales, Dolphins from Drift Gillnets

Bans large mesh drift gillnets that indiscriminately kill or severely injure many endangered, protected marine species

WASHINGTON—The Senate last night unanimously passed the Driftnet Modernization and Bycatch Reduction Act, a bipartisan bill to phase out harmful large mesh drift gillnets utilized in the federal waters off the coast of California, the only place the nets are still used in the United States.

Large mesh driftnets, which are more than a mile long, are left in the ocean overnight to catch swordfish and thresher sharks. Other marine species including whales, dolphins, sea lions, sea turtles, fish, and sharks can also become entangled in the large mesh nets, injuring or killing them. Most of these animals, referred to as bycatch, are then discarded.

Turtle Island Restoration Network has led a coalition of concerned citizens and partner organizations for nearly 20 years, working to stop the devastating impact of this driftnet fishery on sea turtles, whales, dolphins, and other ocean animals. In 2018, California passed a four-year phase out of large mesh drift gillnets in state waters to protect marine life. The Driftnet Modernization and Bycatch Reduction Act would extend similar protections to federal waters within five years and authorize the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to help the commercial fishing industry transition to more sustainable gear types.

“Drift gillnets are responsible for trapping and killing more than 60 different species of marine wildlife, and this legislation will ensure no more whales or dolphins fall victim to this unsustainable fishery,” said Annalisa Batanides Tuel, policy and advocacy manager for Turtle Island Restoration Network. “We are encouraged that the United States is taking steps to address harmful fishing methods in the ocean and off our coasts, as a major cause of biodiversity collapse.”

The use of large mesh driftnets by a single fishery in California is responsible for 90 percent of the dolphins and porpoises killed along the West Coast and Alaska. At least six endangered, threatened, or protected species are harmed by driftnets off the California coast.

The bill was introduced by Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.).

“California’s coast is one of the last places where large mesh drift gillnets are still used to catch swordfish, resulting in needless deaths of whales, dolphins, porpoises, sea turtles and other marine animals,” Senator Feinstein said. “We are now one step closer to removing these nets from our waters. There is no reason to allow the carnage of large mesh drift gillnets when there are better, more sustainable methods to catch swordfish. We can preserve the economically important swordfishing industry while protecting the ocean and its wildlife that are vital to California’s economy.”

“While the use of large mesh drift gillnets is already prohibited off the coasts of most states, these tools are still injuring or killing a whole host of marine animals off California’s coast,” Senator Capito said. “These driftnets, which can be more than a mile long, are left in the ocean overnight to catch swordfish and thresher sharks. However, at least 60 other marine species – including whales, dolphins, sea lions, and sea turtles – can also become entangled in these nets, injuring or killing them. With the passage of our bill, we are a step closer to helping protect our marine species by ensuring that these dangerous driftnets are no longer allowed in U.S. waters.”

Large mesh drift gillnets are already banned in the U.S. territorial waters of the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico, as well as off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, Alaska and Hawaii. However, they remain legal in federal waters off the coast of California. The United States is also a member of international agreements that ban large-scale driftnets in international waters.

The bill would phase out the use of the nets and help the industry transition to more sustainable methods like deep-set buoy gear that uses a hook-and-buoy system. Deep-set buoy gear attracts swordfish with bait and alerts fishermen immediately when a bite is detected. Testing has shown that 94 percent of animals caught with deep-set buoys are swordfish, resulting in far less bycatch than drift gillnets.

Turtle Island Restoration Network is a global nonprofit based in Olema, California whose mission is to inspire and mobilize people around the world to protect marine biodiversity and the oceans that sustain all life on Earth.

"At age 111, America's oldest veteran is still smoking cigars, drinking whiskey and loving life","At age 111, America's oldest veteran is still smoking cigars, drinking whiskey and loving life",1.0,"AUSTIN — Richard Overton is right where he wants to be.

He’s sitting in a lawn chair on the front porch of the Austin home he built nearly 70 years ago, working on his fifth Tampa Sweet cigar on a 91-degree sunny day. The smooth tunes of the Isley Brothers flow from a portable speaker. Birds are chirping in the late afternoon breeze.

“I’m feeling pretty good today,” Overton says, emphasizing the word pretty, because any day spent on this porch smoking cigars is a pretty good day for the 111-year-old.

This is where you’ll find the nation’s oldest veteran for 10 hours every day when the weather is nice. His friends call it his “stage.” It’s where Overton sits and thinks about life, his starting in 1906, the same year as the first wireless radio broadcast and a year before the paper towel was invented.

On this day, Overton is wearing a red cardigan buttoned over a powder blue polo, with light blue slacks and a black World War II veteran hat. He’s smiling and joking and feeling thankful.

The previous week, Overton was wearing a hospital gown. He spent those sunny days stuck in a hospital bed with a 102-degree fever, in a non-smoking room, hooked to an IV as his body tried to fight off its latest bout of pneumonia.

Life has slowed year by year for the lifelong Austin resident. He was once a soldier in the U.S. military, serving in a segregated unit. After returning from war, he spent the bulk of his career working at furniture stores, then at the Texas Department of Treasury. He was a marksman, with a keen eye for hunting rabbits.

“But now, I just sit out here and rest,” he says, releasing a plume of Tampa Sweet smoke.

Overton starts his mornings as early as 3 a.m., drinking two to four cups of coffee. He’ll walk around his house to increase blood flow to his limbs, then smoke his first of 12 daily cigars. If he can, he’ll fall back asleep. Every day, he’s eager for the sun and the neighborhood to rise.

The supercentenarian has been married twice. He never had kids. He’s outlived all of his closest relatives. He has a first cousin who lives down the street, and third cousins who stop by daily.

In December, they started a GoFundMe page, when the price of 24/7 in-home care made it improbable for Overton to remain in his Austin home. Without his house or porch, they feared the worst. But five months later, the GoFundMe page has raised nearly $190,000.

Overton has two caregivers who work 12-hour shifts each day. They make him grits with a glass of whole milk for

and anything from chicken to meatloaf to fried catfish for lunch and dinner.

They also keep track of his visitors, because people stop by all the time at the house on Richard Overton Avenue. That’s right. On his 111th birthday on May 11, the town renamed his street. Some 200 people came out

the party on his front lawn, lining up to take a photo with Overton like kids waiting to meet Santa Claus.

Many brought gifts, like fancy cigars and bottles of whiskey. That’s his drink of choice — a whiskey and Coke — and when his caretakers are pouring, it’s always more Coke than whiskey. His cousins estimate he received more than 40 bottles that day, now dispersed throughout his home in kitchen cabinets, a bedroom closet and dresser drawers.

Certificates, war medals and photos of those he’s loved adorn almost every flat surface in his home. There are photos of Overton when he was in the Army, with broad shoulders, tight skin and a thin mustache. There’s one with President Barack Obama, when the 44th president honored him at a Veteran’s Day ceremony in 2013, his first of two trips to the White House.

He’s met celebrities and politicians and athletes, each asking him the same question about his secret to longevity. His answer? God and cigars.

In 2015, National Geographic released a

short documentary

about Overton made by Austin filmmakers. At the time of filming, he was

and had just renewed his driver’s license. He stopped driving soon after.

Before his latest visit to the hospital, Overton used to take strolls up and down his street. Maybe he’ll do that again if he builds enough strength.

For now, he’s content spending his hours on the stage. He stares at planes as they fly overhead and wonders where they’re going. He talks and sings with the birds. He waves at honking cars, and gazes at the trees he planted long ago, their roots digging into the dirt with each passing year.

All the while smoking a Tampa Sweet.

Smith isn't just going to pay off the Morehouse class of 2019's student loans as he promised at their graduation: He's now promising to pay off their parents' education debt too.

The gift will cost Smith $34 million, the historically black college said in a press release on September 20.

Smith has a net worth of $6.08 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

In May, the private-equity billionaire Robert F. Smith announced he'd be setting up a grant to wipe out the entire Morehouse College class of 2019's student-loan debt.

Now that offer has been expanded to also cover those students' parents' education debt, according to a September 20 press release.

The gift cost Smith $34 million, the historically black college said in the press release. According to the press release, Smith will make the donation to Morehouse's new Student Success Program, which will in turn completely pay off all federal student loans borrowed by the 400 Morehouse students who graduated in May, nearly all of whom are black men, as well as loans owed by their parents and legal guardians.

""This liberation gift from Robert Smith — the first of its kind to be announced at a graduation in higher education —will be life-changing for our new Morehouse Men and their families,"" Morehouse College President David A. Thomas said in a statement. ""It is our hope that our graduates will use their newfound financial freedom to pursue their career goals, to lead and serve the community, and to remember the spirit of the gift given to them by paying it forward to support the education of future classes of Morehouse Men.""

Smith first announced the gift while speaking at the class of 2019's commencement in May.

""You great Morehouse men are bound only by the limits of your own conviction and creativity.""

Smith is the chairman and CEO of the Austin, Texas-based private-equity firm Vista Equity Partners. He has a net worth of $6.08 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

""With the Student Success Program in place, there is a model for all colleges and universities, starting with Morehouse and HBCUs, to receive gifts from alumni and other supporters that can offset the burden of student loans and give students the freedom to pursue their dreams, the capital to invest in the economic growth of their families and the time that they can give back meaningfully to strengthening their communities,"" Smith said in a statement to Business Insider.",https://www.businessinsider.com/robert-f-smith-morehouse-grads-parents-student-debt-pledge-2019-9

Florida man who gave generator to stranger down on her luck gets a free one,Florida man who gave generator to stranger down on her luck gets a free one,1.0,"Ramon Santiago was called a ""hero"" by the Lowe's manager who heard his story.

 -- It was a moment that captured the hearts of many: A Florida woman tearfully embracing a complete stranger who'd given her his generator after she'd lost out on one of her own in the mad rush before Hurricane Irma.

On Thursday, ABC affiliate WFTV in Orlando was at a Lowe's Home Improvement store as residents frantically prepared for Irma.

Sanford resident Pam Brekke had driven more than 30 miles from her home to buy a generator, of which the store had received a surprise shipment of little more than 200. Within two hours, though, the generators were gone. And Brekke, who had been next in line to buy one, got nothing.

Amid Hurricane Irma prep, Florida man offers generator to stranger in need

WFTV captured her breaking down in tears in a corner.

Enter Ramon Santiago of Orlando.

He also saw Brekke crying and insisted that she take the generator he'd carted but had not yet bought. Brekke shared that she'd wanted the generator not for herself but actually for her ailing father who needed it to power his oxygen supply.

""I'm worried about this storm,"" she told WFTV.

The two embraced and went their separate ways but their story -- a random act of kindness in the middle of chaos and stress before a deadly storm -- made the rounds not only on social media, but also at Lowe's.

When a new generator became available later that day, the store manager told WFTV that she immediately thought of Santiago. On Friday, Santiago returned to Lowe's with WFTV to get his own generator for free from the store.

""I wanted to make sure he received it because he definitely deserved it,"" manager Melissa Rodriguez told WFTV. ""He's the hero of the day.""

JK Rowling donates £15.3m to the University of Edinburgh for MS research,JK Rowling donates £15.3m to the University of Edinburgh for MS research,1.0,"JK Rowling has donated £15.3m to the University of Edinburgh to help improve the lives of people with multiple sclerosis (MS) and similar neurodegenerative diseases.

The university has announced that the investment from the Harry Potter author will help create new facilities and fund new research into MS and similar conditions.

Funds will be spent on building new centres at the the Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurology Clinic, which was set up after a previous donation from Rowling in 2010.

The building is named after her mother who died of MS at the age of 45.

Rowling said: “When the Anne Rowling Clinic was first founded, none of us could have predicted the incredible progress that would be made in the field of Regenerative Neurology, with the Clinic leading the charge.

“I am delighted to now support the Anne Rowling Regenerative Neurology Clinic into a new phase of discovery and achievement, as it realises its ambition to create a legacy of better outcomes for generations of people with MS and non-MS neurodegenerative diseases.""

Rowling's donation is designed to help secure the aid of top researchers looking into a cure for MS.

30 best children's books Show all 30 1 /30 30 best children's books 30 best children's books 30. Tom Brown’s Schooldays by Thomas Hughes (1857) This moving, charming and poignant tale of boarding school life is included partly for its own merits, but also as it was the first in the school story genre which spawned so many thousands of books, through Enid Blyton right up to J K Rowling. And, of course, the bully Flashman, without whom we wouldn’t have George McDonald Fraser’s hilarious series detailing his further adventures. 30 best children's books 29. The Tale of Peter Rabbit by Beatrix Potter (1902) Even Potter knew she was writing nostalgically about an imagined past; but who could not fail to love this slyly observed tale of a naughty rabbit? Potter’s arch, almost Austen-esque prose interacts seamlessly with her keenly observed studies of flora and fauna. Avoid the new film, and stick to the original. 30 best children's books 28. How to Train Your Dragon by Cressida Cowell (2003) Quite simply, Cressida Cowell has an exceptional ability to give children what they like. Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III is a Viking who doesn’t fit in: gawky and geeky, his adventures with his hunting-dragon Toothless are madcap and marvellous. Give it to a child, and see them become engrossed immediately. 30 best children's books 27. The Lie Tree by Frances Hardinge (2015, Macmillan) The recent winner of the overall Costa Book Awards is a remarkable novel from a remarkable writer. Hardinge is a true original, her sentences poised and poetic, her alternative 19th-century world fully imagined, and her intelligent, inquiring female lead not simply a good role model but also a fine addition to literature. 30 best children's books 26. Noughts and Crosses by Malorie Blackman (2001) Former Children’s Laureate Malorie Blackman’s novel described a world in which black Africans had enslaved white Europeans. Whites, or noughts, were economically impoverished, whilst the blacks, or crosses, were in power. An inter-racial love affair between two teens brings first passion and then tragedy. Powerful, provocative and original. 30 best children's books 25. The Mouse and His Child by Russell Hoban (1967) A bittersweet and unusual tale, in which a clockwork mouse and his child are thrown out of a toy shop, and then must embark on a journey to find safety. Unlike the film Toy Story, in which the toys are complicit in their servitude, this allows discarded toys to find a world of their own, constructed according to their own terms. Full of striking imagery and exciting scenes. 30 best children's books 24. Down with Skool! A Guide to School Life for Tiny Pupils and their Parents by Geoffrey Willans and Ronald Searle (1953) As any fule know, reading Molesworth is like being a member of a secret skool gang. Complemented by Ronald Searle’s satirical drawings of depressed, deluded schoolmasters and grubby, disobedient schoolboys, all the world’s vanity and hypocrisy is on display through Molesworth’s cynical, instantly likeable and badly spelled voice. A grate writer, indeed. 30 best children's books 23. Artemis Fowl by Eoin Colfer (2001) A wondrously clever book that upturns children’s literature convention. Its hero, Artemis Fowl, is a 12 year old boy who also happens to be a criminal mastermind. Containing such characters as a kleptomaniac, flatulent dwarf, and a centaur called Foaly who’s also a technical whizz, this is a hilarious delight. 30 best children's books 22. The Scarecrows by Robert Westall (1981) I’ve chosen The Scarecrows over The Machine Gunners, which is perhaps Westall’s better known book, as I think this has a quality of terror and an understanding of adolescence that is matchless. It focuses on a boy’s tortured relationship with his stepfather, and the encroachment of a murder that happened many years before. Unforgettably spine-tingling, and profoundly affecting. 30 best children's books 21. The Harry Potter series by J K Rowling (late 20th century) First published over 20 years ago, Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone blazed into the world’s consciousness like a bolt of lightning. Moving from the initial wonder and quirky charm of the first three books, the series took on a darker tone, resulting in an enthralling septet and a cultural phenomenon. 30 best children's books 20. The Ghost of Thomas Kemp by Penelope Lively (1973) Penelope Lively once said that “Children need to sense that we live in a permanent world that reaches away behind and ahead of us.” Her writing encompasses a huge range, and this, her Carnegie-winning novel about a house beset by the spirit of a sorceror, is eerie, effective and involving. 30 best children's books 19. Tom’s Midnight Garden by Philippa Pearce (1958) Considered by many to be one of children’s literature’s most outstanding examples. Tom is packed away to stay with his aunt and uncle: but when the clock strikes thirteen, he finds a gorgeous garden, and in it a little girl called Hatty, who seems to come from a different time. Emotionally rich, it will leave a lasting impression on any child. 30 best children's books 18. The Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula Le Guin (1968) The recent death of Ursula Le Guin, aged 88, has brought renewed attention to her works. Ged, a dark skinned boy from the goat herding island of Gont, demonstrates exceptional powers and is sent to learn how to be a wizard. His resulting quest is epic, with a depth and strangeness that lasts. 30 best children's books 17. The Wolves of Willoughby Chase by Joan Aiken (1962) This has all the hallmarks of classic children’s literature: missing parents, a usurping adult, terrible injustices and the romance of winter and wolves. Set in an alternative historical era, where James III rules, little Bonnie’s fortune is snatched by a sinister governess. Children will cheer when she gets her comeuppance. 30 best children's books 16. The Story of Ferdinand by Munro Leaf (1936) What at first seems to be a delightful story about a little bull who hates fighting becomes a potent fable about what’s expected of boys. Rejecting masculine violence, Ferdinand prefers just to sit under a cork tree. The illustrations of Spanish matadors, picadors and their arenas are astoundingly evocative. 30 best children's books 15. Where the Wild Things Are by Maurice Sendak (1963) A picture book that reveals more about itself each time it’s read. Note how the pictures expand as Max’s imaginative world grows; how the text, poetic and spare, interacts with the visuals; how Max, through his journey into the interior of his self, meets and conquers his anger at his mother. The drawings are lovely, too. 30 best children's books 14. Matilda by Roald Dahl (1988) I’m willing to bet that after reading this, many children stared at pencils, hoping they might be able to move them with their mind alone. Dahl’s exuberant imagination is on full display in this emotionally weighty story about a little girl’s fight for love and escape. Miss Trunchbull, the vicious headmistress, is one of literature’s great villains. 30 best children's books 13. The Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling (1894) Raised by wolves, Mowgli must face the terrible tiger Shere Khan, with the help of Baloo, a “sleepy brown bear”, and Bagheera, a panther. Full of invention and adventure, the stories were an immediate hit, the behaviour of the animals believable and, paradoxically, human. Their wildness and subtleties have become thoroughly imbued into the popular imagination. 30 best children's books 12. Five Children and It by E Nesbit (1902) A representative from the first Golden Age of children’s fiction in the early 20th century. Nesbit’s grumpy, vain wish-granting Psammead (or “sand fairy”), an immortal who used to eat Pterodactyl for breakfast, offers adventure in a world without oppressive evil. The brothers and sisters find that magic doesn’t always offer a solution. 30 best children's books 11. The Once and Future King by T H White (1958) Captivating, wise, witty, this collection of three earlier books treats the Matter of Britain. TH White’s masterstroke was to imagine the young king Arthur as Wart, an ordinary boy thrust into extraordinary situations; and his Merlin as a kindly, forgetful old man (viz. Dumbledore). Neglected in recent years, White deserves a place in the limelight once more. 30 best children's books 10. The Wind in the Willows by Kenneth Grahame (1908) There is some debate as to whether The Wind in the Willows is a children’s book, or whether it’s really a book to lift up the spirits of down-trodden city clerks. Either way, the gentle adventures of Mole and Ratty, and Toad’s ridiculous shenanigans, express a lyrical love of the pleasures of rural life. 30 best children's books 9. The Hobbit by JRR Tolkien (1937) In The Hobbit, an odder book than it at first appears, the tiny hairy-footed Bilbo Baggins goes on a journey with some dwarves, and is actually rewarded for being a thief. The charm of the hobbits’ world is matched by the excitement of the adventures Bilbo finds himself entangled in; and many readers will be led on to its vast sequel, The Lord of the Rings. 30 best children's books 8. Northern Lights by Philip Pullman (1995) Philip Pullman’s daemons, in his lavishly-imagined alternative world run by a sinister religious organisation, are among the most enduring creations of children’s literature. His themes are cosmic and vast, with a dizzying sense of possibility; his story spellbinding; and in Lyra Belacqua, he made a heroine at once appealing, spiky and enduring. 30 best children's books 7. The Narnia series by C S Lewis (mid 20th century) The best children’s books have a way of altering the universe around them. Everyone can remember their first encounter with Narnia, and then trying to get through the back of the wardrobe afterwards into the enticing other world. Lewis’ stroke of genius, of course, was making the animals talk; the knightly adventures of the children are gripping. 30 best children's books 6. The Pilgrim's Progress from This World, to That Which Is to Come by John Bunyan (1678) One of the first books enthusiastically taken up by children, this is now largely neglected, even by adults and scholars; unjustly so, as its allegorical power and beauty are unsurpassed. Its humour and colloquial nature mean it is still accessible. From the Slough of Despond to the Celestial City, it brims with memorable places and people. 30 best children's books 5. Peter and Wendy by J M Barrie (1911) Some would argue that this novelised form of the play Peter Pan is not a children’s book, being instead complicit with an ironic, adult viewpoint; however this, and all its variants, are enjoyed immensely by children. There is the theme-park like world of Neverland; the sense of unbounded imagination; and the dizzying allure of flight and magic. 30 best children's books 4. The One Thousand and One Nights by Anon. (Folk tales) This scintillating series, which Scheherazade spins to her royal husband every night so that he spares her life to hear their conclusion, first came to Europe in 1704 in a French text that also contained Aladdin, Ali Baba and Sinbad the Sailor. Elemental, opulent and wondrous, the stories are full of passion and revenges, and remain enormously influential. 30 best children's books 3. Fairy Tales by Hans Christian Andersen (19th century) A strange and shy man, Hans Christian Andersen produced some of the most beautiful and reverberant literary fairy tales in the world, about loss, love and longing. Gerda’s search for her brother Kay in ‘The Snow Queen’; the Little Mermaid’s mute passion for her prince; gorgeously written, they offer solace and enchantment. 30 best children's books 2. Kinder- und Hausmärchen (‘Nursery and Household Tales’) by The Brothers Grimm (19th century) Exceptionally influential, this collection of over 200 tales underwent many editions in the Grimms’ lifetime. Though the seamier elements were altered for a prudish bourgeois audience, the fairy tales retain a depth which resonates with children and adults alike. We all know The Frog Prince and Hansel and Gretel; but have you read “Hans my Hedgehog”, about a half boy, half hedgehog? 30 best children's books 1. The Alice Books by Lewis Carroll (19th century) Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, and Through the Looking Glass, and what Alice Found There, are an extraordinary brace of books, written by the mathematican Charles Dodgson, under his pseudonym of Lewis Carroll. He employed logic, humour and inventive fantasy, fashioning the most powerful and unusual works in children’s literature. Some have tried to work out why a raven is like a writing desk. But most will be content to be drawn away into enchantment.

Superlo to open in Kroger’s former Lamar Avenue location,Kroger Donates Closed Store Building To Local Competitor To Prevent A Food Desert,1.0,"This is an archived article and the information in the article may be outdated. Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.

MEMPHIS, Tenn. — A full-service grocery is returning to a South Memphis intersection where a Kroger store closed last year.

Kroger officials announced Monday morning that the company had donated its former building on Lamar near Airways to a competitor, locally owned Superlo Foods, which will open in the space.

Superlo hopes to have the new store operating by Dec. 1. Randy Stepherson, president and board chairman of SuperLo Foods, said the company was happy to be entering the Orange Mound market.

Kroger officials said the company had never before donated a building, but had set aside competition to keep a promise made to the community to bring a full-service grocery store back to the Orange Mound area. The building is worth about $500,000.

“Since becoming the president of Kroger Delta in February, it has been a priority for us to keep our promise to the City of Memphis and the Orange Mound community,” said Victor Smith, president, Kroger Delta Division.

Kroger closed the Lamar Avenue store in February 2018, leading to complaints from the community. The Rev. Jesse Jackson threatened a boycott of the chain.

City officials including Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland and District 4 City Council representative Jamita Swearengen attended an announcement Monday at Kroger’s Delta Division headquarters.

Superlo, a family- and employee-owned company, has about a half-dozen locations in the Memphis area, although none are currently located in Orange Mound or South Memphis.

YouTube shuts down music companies’ use of manual copyright claims to steal creator revenue – TechCrunch,YouTube shuts down music companies’ use of manual copyright claims to steal creator revenue – TechCrunch,1.0,"YouTube is making a change to its copyright enforcement policies around music used in videos, which may result in an increased number of blocked videos in the shorter term — but overall, a healthier ecosystem in the long term. Going forward, copyright owners will no longer be able to monetize creator videos with very short or unintentional uses of music via YouTube’s “Manual Claiming” tool. Instead, they can choose to prevent the other party from monetizing the video or they can block the content. However, YouTube expects that by removing the option to monetize these sorts of videos themselves, some copyright holders will instead just leave them alone.

“One concerning trend we’ve seen is aggressive manual claiming of very short music clips used in monetized videos. These claims can feel particularly unfair, as they transfer all revenue from the creator to the claimant, regardless of the amount of music claimed,” explained YouTube in a blog post.

To be clear, the changes only involve YouTube’s Manual Claiming tool which is not how the majority of copyright violations are handled today. Instead, the majority of claims are created through YouTube’s Content ID match system. This system scans videos uploaded to YouTube against a database of files submitted to the site by copyright owners. Then, when a match is found, the copyright holder owner can choose to block the video or monetize it themselves, and track the video’s viewership stats.

The Manual Claiming tool, on the other hand, is only offered to partners who understand how Content ID works. It allows them to search through publicly available YouTube videos to look for those containing their content and apply a claim when a match is found.

The problem with the Manual Claiming policy is that it was impacting creator content even when the use of the claimed music in videos was very short — even a second long — or unintentional. For example, a creator who was vlogging may have walked past a store that was playing the copyrighted song, but then could lose the revenue from their video as a result.

In April, YouTube said it was looking to address this problem. And just ahead of this year’s VidCon, YouTube announced several well-received changes to the Manual Claiming Policy. It began to require that copyright owners specify the timestamp in the video where the claim occurs — a change that YouTube hoped would create additional friction and cut down on abuse.

Creators were also given tools of their own that let them easily remove the clip or replace the infringing content with free-to-use tracks.

These newly announced changes go even further as they remove the ability for the copyright owner to monetize the infringing video at all. Copyright holders can now only prevent the creators themselves from monetizing the video, or they can block the content. However, given the new creator tools for handling infringing content, it’s likely that creators in those situations would just address the problem content in order to keep their video online.

“As always, the best way to avoid these issues is to not use unlicensed content in your videos, even when it’s unintentional music playing in the background,” noted YouTube.

It also urged creators to utilize its resources, like the YouTube Audio Library, and to read up on YouTube’s dispute process policies before uploading content that the creator believes is a copyright exception due to Fair Use.

YouTube says the changes will apply to all new manual claims, starting in mid-September.

Once enforcement begins, copyright owners who repeatedly fail to adhere to the policies will lose access to the Manual Claiming tool.

The response from the creator community, not surprisingly, has been positive as creators thanked YouTube for finally listening to them and responding to their concerns over this sort of copyright claim abuse.",https://techcrunch.com/2019/08/16/youtube-shuts-down-music-companies-use-of-manual-copyright-claims-to-steal-creator-revenue/

Last month, Skye Savren-McCormick got to be the flower girl in a wedding. To prepare, she practiced walking with a little basket in her living room.

Even so, on the day of the wedding the 3-year-old still took a big fistful of petals and dropped them on the ground before taking her first step down the aisle.

And the wedding guests could barely hold it together.

Because not long ago, Skye’s doctors gave her a 10% chance to live. Stricken with childhood cancer, she needed a bone marrow transplant to survive.

She got one, from a stranger – Hayden Hatfield Ryals, who later invited Skye to be the flower girl in her wedding.

Now Skye is in remission. And those who were at the ceremony that day say they’ll never forget it.

“There wasn’t a dry eye in the room,” said wedding photographer Jeannie Broadway. “You could even hear sobs from people.”

She’s been fighting cancer her whole life

When she was just under a year old, Skye was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer called juvenile myelomonacytic leukemia. She had blood and platelet transfusions almost daily. She was in the hospital for 10 months because of complications while getting treatment.

But she needed a bone marrow transplant – and fast. Luckily, a perfect match was found, said her mother, Talia Savren-McCormick.

Ryals, 26, signed up to be a bone marrow donor in college. She had just changed her major, and she wasn’t sure what she wanted to do. She felt lost. She had always thought donating blood and platelets was important, so when she found out you could donate bone marrow, she knew she wanted to register as a donor.

A year after she registered, she found out she was a match for Skye. This, she said, gave her purpose again.

“That changed everything,” Ryals said. “It became my number-one priority from that point on.”

Donating bone marrow is anonymous, so Ryals and Skye didn’t meet. But from that surgery in 2016, the two were linked.

The Savren-McCormick family then received more horrible news: Skye had developed a second form of cancer, this time post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder. Fewer than 1% of bone marrow transplant recipients get it as a result of their transplant. Skye’s chances of survival looked bleak. But after chemotherapy and more bone marrow transplants, she pulled through.

“She’s a fighter, and she is full of spunk, and she just has the best attitude, and I think everybody could learn something from this 3-year old,” Ryals said.

They met for the first time at the wedding

Shortly after Skye’s first transplant from Ryals, the donor sent the family an anonymous letter through Be the Match, the nonprofit organization through which she donated her bone marrow. The letter said Ryals was thinking of the family, and being called to donate gave her a sense of purpose. Savren-McCormick sent an anonymous letter back.

Finally, Ryals and the Savren-McCormick family both reached out to Be the Match, saying they’d like to get in touch with each other. Though the Savren-McCormicks lived in California and Ryals lived in Alabama, they soon formed a bond.

The relationship began through email, then a phone call and texting.

For Skye’s birthday, Ryals sent her a present with an invitation to serve as flower girl in her wedding.

“We were really taken aback by how sweet it was,” Savren-McCormick said.

The toddler was on oxygen at the time, and they thought there was no way they’d be able to go. But once she was off oxygen, her doctors said it would be fine.

Skye Savren-McCormick and Ryals met for the first time at the wedding rehearsal.

“We were in the front, looking around, and she [Ryals] came in and immediately came over to Skye and dropped to her knees,” Savren-McCormick said. “Skye gave her a big hug. The whole night they were sitting together.”

“It was so sweet,” she added. “It was like they were in love.”

They share a special bond

The two shared an instant connection. Though Skye is too young to know that Ryals helped save her life, she knows that Ryals is somebody special, her mother said.

“I look forward to the years to come with Skye growing up and continuing this relationship with Hayden, and watching Hayden grow up, too,” Savren-McCormick said.

The Savren-McCormicks stress to people how easy it is to get on the registry to donate bone marrow.

“Anyone could be somebody who saves a life,” Savren-McCormick said. “You don’t have to be a superhero.”

Ryals said she’ll feel a link to Skye for the rest of her life.

“She’s everything to me,” she said. “And this whole journey, I’ve never once seen it as me helping her, because I was honored to do it, and it was a privilege for me to get to do it.”",https://fox43.com/2018/07/09/3-year-old-cancer-survivor-serves-as-flower-girl-in-her-bone-marrow-donors-wedding/
Anti-poaching unit nabs 365 poachers in six months,Anti-poaching unit nabs 365 poachers in six months,1.0,"Durban - A specialised unit, set up to fight poaching have made great strides in their bid to stamp out rhino poaching. Over the last six months, a total of 365 rhino poachers have been convicted and an additional 15 men aged between 33 and 50, have been arrested.

National police spokesperson, Brigadier Vish Naidoo said the 15 were nabbed following sting operations in Mpumalanga.

He said police recovered four unlicensed firearms and ammunition.

Naidoo said between January and June 2018, the Rhino 9 Task Team secured various convictions, the maximum nine years’ imprisonment and the least being three months’ imprisonment with the option of paying a R1 500 fine.

“Of the 365 suspects who were arrested, 165 remain in custody while facing court processes, six were deported to their native countries, 11 received fines and 57 are serving their various jail terms. These convictions are evidence of the commitment of law enforcement agencies and game reserve parks to preserve endangered species for future generations,” Naidoo said.

Meanwhile, the 15 nabbed last week have since appeared in court on charges of unlawful possession of firearm/s, unlawful possession of ammunition, possession of dangerous weapon/s, trespassing, hunting of protected animal, kidnapping, assault, possession of the remains of a wild animal, possession of suspected stolen property and being in the country illegally or without proper documentation.

“Axes, tog bags, cellphones, and other incriminating evidence were also seized during the arrests. The Rhino 9 Task Team is a multidisciplinary team operating in Mpumalanga comprising of various government departments including members from various disciplines in the South African Police Service, Customs and Excise, the South African National Defence Force, as well as Ezemvelo and SANParks game rangers,” Naidoo said.

He added that a the strategies that the unit has put in place is significantly reducing the chances of smugglers operating at ports of entry in national parks.

“These arrests should serve as a warning and deterrent to other potential poachers,” Naidoo said.

He said community support and assistance is welcomed in the fight against this scourge. “Poachers and smugglers are warned that over and above facing criminal prosecution, their ill-gotten gains will also be confiscated in terms of the Prevention of Organised Crime Act 121/1998 (POCA). We urge the people of South Africa to continue supporting the police in its efforts to bring down the scourge of crime because together we can do more. Anyone with information related to rhino poaching may contact the nearest police station or SAPS Crime Stop number: 08600 10111,” Naidoo said.

Soviet submarine officer who averted nuclear war honoured with prize,Soviet submarine officer who averted nuclear war awarded 'Future of Life' prize,1.0,"A senior officer of a Soviet submarine who averted the outbreak of nuclear conflict during the cold war is to be honoured with a new prize, 55 years to the day after his heroic actions averted global catastrophe.

On 27 October 1962, Vasili Alexandrovich Arkhipov was on board the Soviet submarine B-59 near Cuba when the US forces began dropping non-lethal depth charges. While the action was designed to encourage the Soviet submarines to surface, the crew of B-59 had been incommunicado and so were unaware of the intention. They thought they were witnessing the beginning of a third world war.



Trapped in the sweltering submarine – the air-conditioning was no longer working – the crew feared death. But, unknown to the US forces, they had a special weapon in their arsenal: a ten kilotonne nuclear torpedo. What’s more, the officers had permission to launch it without waiting for approval from Moscow.

Two of the vessel’s senior officers – including the captain, Valentin Savitsky – wanted to launch the missile. According to a report from the US National Security Archive, Savitsky exclaimed: “We’re gonna blast them now! We will die, but we will sink them all – we will not become the shame of the fleet.”

But there was an important caveat: all three senior officers on board had to agree to deploy the weapon. As a result, the situation in the control room played out very differently. Arkhipov refused to sanction the launch of the weapon and calmed the captain down. The torpedo was never fired.

Had it been launched, the fate of the world would have been very different: the attack would probably have started a nuclear war which would have caused global devastation, with unimaginable numbers of civilian deaths.



“The lesson from this is that a guy called Vasili Arkhipov saved the world,’’ Thomas Blanton, director of the National Security Archive at George Washington University, told the Boston Globe in 2002, following a conference in which the details of the situation were explored.



Now, 55 years after he averted nuclear war and 19 years after his death, Arkhipov is to be honoured, with his family the first recipients of a new award.

The prize, dubbed the “Future of Life award” is the brainchild of the Future of Life Insitute – a US-based organisation whose goal is to tackle threats to humanity and whose advisory board includes such luminaries as Elon Musk, the astronomer royal Prof Martin Rees, and actor Morgan Freeman.



“The Future of Life award is a prize awarded for a heroic act that has greatly benefited humankind, done despite personal risk and without being rewarded at the time,” said Max Tegmark, professor of physics at MIT and leader of the Future of Life Institute.

Speaking to Tegmark, Arkhipov’s daughter Elena Andriukova said the family were grateful for the prize, and its recognition of Arkhipov’s actions.

“He always thought that he did what he had to do and never considered his actions as heroism. He acted like a man who knew what kind of disasters can come from radiation,” she said. “He did his part for the future so that everyone can live on our planet.”

The $50,000 prize will be presented to Arkhipov’s grandson, Sergei, and Andriukova at the Institute of Engineering and Technology on Friday evening.

Beatrice Fihn, executive director of the Nobel peace prize-winning organisation, the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, said Arkhipov’s actions were a reminder of how the world had teetered on the brink of disaster. “Arkhipov’s story shows how close to nuclear catastrophe we have been in the past,” she said.



The timing of the award, Fihn added, is apt. “As the risk of nuclear war is on the rise right now, all states must urgently join the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons to prevent such catastrophe.”

Dr Jonathan Colman, an expert on the Cuban missile crisis at the University of Central Lancashire, agreed that the award was fitting.

“While accounts differ about what went on on board the B-59, it is clear that Arkhipov and the crew operated under conditions of extreme tension and physical hardship. Once the nuclear threshold had been crossed, it is hard to imagine that the genie could have been put back into the bottle,” he said.

“President Kennedy had been very worried about the possibility of a clash between American warships and Soviet submarines in the Caribbean, and it is absolutely clear that his fears were justified,” Colman added, noting that certain decisions at the operational level were out of his control. “Ultimately, it was luck as much as management that ensured that the missile crisis ended without the most dreadful consequences.”",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/oct/27/vasili-arkhipov-soviet-submarine-captain-who-averted-nuclear-war-awarded-future-of-life-prize
"An Admirals tough guy, a tiny baby, a snowstorm and an opponent's act of kindness",AHL goalie loans truck to opponent to allow him to drive 6 hours through a snowstorm to see birth of child,1.0,"Pierre-Cedric Labrie and Jana Pieuze-Roy expected a baby in the new year.

Instead they got a story about a snowstorm bad enough to scare a Canadian, and an act of kindness that would turn a hockey bruiser into a 6-foot-3, 228-pound teddy bear.

And they got Lionel.

Although the littlest Labrie got an early start on the party, he waited just long enough.

“We played here on Friday, left for Grand Rapids on Saturday and she texted me. In the bus. Half way,” said Labrie, who plays left wing for the Milwaukee Admirals.

“She’s like, ‘Yeah, I’m having some cramps.’ I’m like, ‘Tell me right now. I’ll stop the bus and get a ride from here.’ She said, ‘No, I’m going to be fine.’ ”

So Labrie and the Admirals completed their 4 1/2-hour bus ride around the southern tip of Lake Michigan, hoping to carry the high from a home-ice victory over Chicago into an evening game against the Grand Rapids Griffins.

“I went to bed around midnight, and at 2 a.m. the phone rings,” Labrie said after practice Thursday at the UW-Milwaukee Panther Arena.

“Water broke.”

The first flight out of Grand Rapids to anywhere close would have got Labrie to Chicago at 6:30 in the morning, and he’d still have had a 90-minute drive to Milwaukee.

“Her mom, for two kids, (labor was) less than six hours,” Labrie said. “I knew I had really a small gap.”

Other options were getting him nowhere, and time was wasting.

His last thought was to wake up Admirals teammate Mark Zengerle, who spent two seasons as a Griffin. It couldn’t hurt to ask him for ideas, right?

“I was like, ‘Zenger, you played in GR (Grand Rapids) a couple years ago,’ ” Labrie said. “ ‘Do you know anybody that would let me borrow a car?’ Because I called taxi drivers, there’s a bad storm, no one wants to take me to Milwaukee. With the New Year’s Eve parties, all the chauffeurs for the private cars are reserved.

“He’s like, ‘There’s a guy on the other team. He’s a really good guy.’ ”

The Griffins were headed back from a night game in Cleveland when Zengerle’s text message popped up on backup goaltender Tom McCollum’s phone. McCollum was watching a movie. He can’t sleep on the bus.

“It was kind of funny the way he said it,” McCollum said in a telephone interview Thursday. “He was like, ‘Hey, I’ve got a question; it’s totally cool if you say no,’ and just kind of explained the situation of what happened.”

Although the team wouldn’t be back to Grand Rapids for another 90 minutes, McCollum lives virtually across the street from the Admirals’ hotel. His girlfriend was at home. McCollum wasn’t going to need his Ford F-150 for a couple of days anyway, and the Griffins were headed to Milwaukee two days later.

McCollum didn’t think twice about helping out someone he'd only run into on the ice.

“I’ve never actually met PC, but I played against him a bunch when he was in Rockford,” McCollum said. “He’s one of those ... you can just tell he’s an honest hockey player.

“Especially the tough guys, they always seem to be the nicest guys off the ice. Again, knowing that he’s been around for a few years and knowing he’s an older guy, those are the kind of guys you trust.”

Although McCollum doesn’t have children, he’s seen the effect fatherhood has had on teammates. He had a good idea of what getting home would mean to Labrie.

“If he didn’t let me, I would have been panicking,” Labrie said. “I would have been walking the street, like, ‘Hey, you. How much you want, you drive me to Milwaukee right now?’ I was, like, panicking. I need to get there.”

Before 3 a.m. local time, Labrie was on his way. And before long the lake-effect snow picked up to a near whiteout.

“Good thing I had the big truck of the guy,” Labrie said, showing a video from along the way. “It got worse.

“(It’s) so nerve-wracking, driving through. Soon as I passed that, my eyes start getting (strained). I have to stop, like, 15-20 minutes, and just lay there.”

Then he pressed on.

“Got to the hospital at 6:15,” Labrie said. “And deliver the baby at 6:54.

“I was there for only 40 minutes, the last, final pushes. Here we go. I missed all the contractions earlier, the toughest part, when she doesn’t have the — what do you call it? — the epidural.

“She was with her mom. Thank God she was here or I don’t know. Everything turned out good.”

Lionel weighed in at 5 pounds, 15 ounces.

“Just like me,” Labrie said, “tiny.”

Labrie was being serious, too; he knows he was a small baby although he'd have had to ask his mother for the specifics.

McCollum and Labrie actually met for the first time Wednesday, after the Griffins beat the Admirals, 4-2. They had time for little more than hello and a handshake. Labrie returned McCollum’s keys, and McCollum followed his bus back to Michigan.

“He offered to pay me for (using the truck),” McCollum said. “I just asked him to fill it up with gas, and he was nice enough he washed it for me before he gave it back. That’s all I need honestly.

“I was happy to be able to facilitate the situation. I was more than thrilled when he texted me that he made it in time.”",https://www.jsonline.com/story/sports/hockey/2018/01/05/tough-guy-tiny-baby-snowstorm-and-opponents-act-kindness/1006565001/?platform=hootsuite
Gryffindogs or Hufflefluff: Animal shelter sorts dogs into Hogwarts-themed houses,Florida dog shelter sorts dogs by Hogwarts house rather than breed to end breed discrimination.,1.0,"Dogs at the Pet Alliance of Greater Orlando are being sorted by personality.

 -- An animal shelter in Florida has sprinkled some “Harry Potter”-inspired magic into its dog adoption process.

Dogs at the Pet Alliance of Greater Orlando are now being sorted into four categories inspired by the Hogwarts houses made famous by J.K. Rowling’s book series.

Much as the Sorting Hat did at Hogwarts, Pet Alliance staffers divide adoptable dogs into the houses of Gryffindogs (Gryffindor), Ravenpaw (Ravenclaw), Hufflefluff (Hufflepuff) or Slobberin (Slytherin), based on their personalities. Employees observe the dogs interacting with toys and other dogs before assigning them to a house, the shelter said.

When potential adopters arrive at the shelter, they read about the dogs' characteristics rather than their breeds.

“We want people to look at the dog for their behavior and personality and what their talents are,” said Stephen Bardy, Pet Alliance of Greater Orlando’s executive director. “We really wanted people to take a look at dogs for the dogs.”

He said he came up with the idea for the “Harry Potter”–themed houses as a fun way to address what is a serious problem: breed discrimination.

The Pet Alliance of Greater Orlando, a nonprofit shelter, gets about 1,800 pets per year that are surrendered because their owners are moving and their new landlord does not accept certain breeds, Bardy said, adding that most of those pets are dogs.

The shelter hopes that by not attaching breeds to dogs during the adoption process, people will pay more attention to the type of dog that will be the best fit for them. Bardy would like the initiative to spark a national conversation and encourage more shelters to do the same.

“We want people to understand what they want in a dog and what will work in their lifestyle rather than going into a shelter and saying, ‘I want a black Lab,’” Bardy said. “We want people to start talking about their own lifestyles and personalities and allow us to match a dog to them not based on looks or breed.”

The shelter took another page from the “Harry Potter” books by not separating puppies younger than 6 months into houses, Bardy said. In the series, only kids 11 or older are sorted into houses.

Dogs at the shelter stay in a house dubbed Pawgwarts while they wait to be sorted, he said.

The shelter has created an online quiz for dog owners everywhere to match their dogs with one of the four houses.

Bardy reports the shelter has seen a significant spike in foot and online traffic since launching the initiative last month. In the last week alone, 23 dogs were adopted from ""Harry Potter""-themed houses.

The most popular so far has been the Hufflepuff house, whose characteristics apply to nearly all dog breeds: hard work, dedication, patience, loyalty, justice and fair play.

“We don’t want to build a bigger shelter. We want to figure out a way to end pet homelessness,” said Bardy. “It comes down to understanding dogs’ behavior and personalities and being a responsible pet owner.”",http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/gryffindogs-hufflefluff-animal-shelter-sorts-dogs-hogwarts-themed/story?id=50883535

Australian wildlife was also hugely impacted by the unprecedented bushfire season; it's estimated more than one billion animals were killed.

World Wildlife Fund policy manager Dr Stuart Blanch said the summer bushfire crisis had an enormous impact on koala habitats.

LISA MAREE WILLIAMS/GETTY IMAGES Koalas affected by the bushfires sit in a recovery pen at the Kangaroo Island Wildlife Park.

Preliminary surveys in NSW's north indicated some populations had shrunk by 80 to 85 per cent following the fires, Blanch told a NSW parliamentary inquiry in February.

Some NSW koala populations could be extinct by 2050, or sooner, he added.

For locals in the state, the NSW government paid out more than A$37 million (NZ$38.6m) in disaster relief grants to primary producers affected by fires.

Goodbye Old Pot Charges: California Program to Erase Old Marijuana Convictions,California Program to Erase Old Marijuana Convictions,1.0,"Every California county prosecutor can now use new technology to erase or reduce an estimated 220,000 old marijuana convictions after voters broadly legalized the drug in 2016.

Code for America, a San Francisco-based nonprofit tech organization, announced Thursday it is making its computer algorithms available for free to all 58 district attorneys. The program quickly finds eligible cases in court documents that may date back decades.

Six counties including Los Angeles and San Francisco earlier used the Clear My Record program on a trial basis to clear an estimated 75,000 cannabis convictions.

Voters approved eliminating some pot-related crimes and wiping out past criminal convictions or reducing felonies to misdemeanors when they legalized adult marijuana use in 2016.

But there was no easy way to identify those who qualified.

The computer program not only identifies eligible cases, but automatically fills out forms to file with the courts. It can analyze conviction eligibility for about 10,000 people per minute, instead of requiring county employees to dig through individual records.

District attorneys have until July to decide whether to dismiss sentences or fight reducing the convictions.

Code for America founder and executive director Jennifer Pahlka said in a statement that the expansion ""will open the door to relief for tens of thousands of Californians...who have been denied jobs, housing and other opportunities because of their criminal record.""

The announcement comes a week after Cook County, Illinois, State's Attorney Kimberly Foxx announced she would use the technology, becoming the first county outside California to participate.",https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/marijuana-los-angeles-san-francisco-recreational-pot-559590321.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_LABrand
Colorado lawmaker wants to bar convicted animal abusers from owning pets,Colorado law would bar convicted animal abusers from owning pets,1.0,"People convicted of animal abuse could be banned from owning, babysitting or living with an animal if a Denver Democrat’s bill becomes state law.

Judges would also get the option to include therapy or anger management classes as part of a sentence.

“I think the real important piece of this legislation is the component that deals with judges being able to sentence folks to anger management or mental health treatment,” Rep. Alex Valdez, D-Denver, said.“There’s a correlation between people who commit acts of violence against animals and those same people committing acts of violence against people.”

HB19-1092 would give judges the discretion to prohibit adults and juveniles convicted of misdemeanor animal abuse from “owning, possessing, caring for, or residing with an animal of any kind” for a certain number of years. The ban would be mandatory for people convicted of felony animal abuse.

Valdez, a first-year lawmaker, modeled the bill after a California law that bans pet ownership for five years after a misdemeanor conviction and 10 years for a felony. But he said he got some pushback from members of the House Judiciary Committee where the bill is scheduled for its first hearing Thursday. He plans to change it during that hearing to give judges more leeway when it comes to sentencing.

“We’re leaving (misdemeanors) up to judicial discretion,” Valdez said. “They’re dealing with these cases day in and day out, and we don’t want to take away their ability to evaluate cases individually.”

Currently, Valdez said, judges don’t have a lot of discretion when it comes to the pets of people who mistreated an animal.

“As much as I love animals, this bill is about helping people who do these sorts of things, so we can prevent them from committing worse crimes in the future,” Valdez said.

Women in domestic violence shelters were 11 times more likely to report a partner had harmed or killed a pet than women who hadn’t experience domestic violence, according to a 2007 study for Sage Journals. Another study, by researchers at Northeastern University, found people who commit animal abuse were five times more likely to commit violent crime against a person.

Republicans in the Colorado House declined to comment through their spokesperson, but Valdez is optimistic his bill will find support from both parties.

Florida Republican Rick Scott signed a similar bill into law there in March 2018 when he was the governor.

“If Florida can pass this under complete conservative leadership, I think that we have a really good chance of doing this in Colorado as well,” Valdez said.",https://www.denverpost.com/2019/01/29/colorado-animal-abusers-pet-ban/
"Porch pirates return WWE belt to boy awaiting brain surgery, pen apology note: 'We never wanted to steal a child's hope'","5 year old wrestling fan who has terminal illness recently had a replica title belt stolen. Criminals feel remorse and return the stolen belt, Along with apology and vow to get sober.",1.0,"Timmy Vick, a 5-year-old autistic boy from Delaware, likes to sleep with his replica WWE belt at night. (Credit: Sergio Moreira)

A group of porch pirates returned a stolen package of WWE belts that were meant for a sick 5-year-old boy and penned a heartfelt apology letter following public outcry.

The belts belonged to Timmy Vick, a boy with autism from Delaware who needs surgery to remove a dangerous brain tumor. According to the young boy’s father, Tim Sr., his son takes the wrestling belt with him everywhere and finds comfort sleeping with the accessory.

After Timmy’s father reached out to Sergio Moreira, a wrestling belt artist who refurbishes WWE replica belts with metal, leather, cubic zirconia and more, Moreira offered to decorate the sick boy’s accessory free of charge.

“When [Timmy’s father] sent me a message and asked me for help, he just was hoping for a discount,” Moreira tells Yahoo Lifestyle. Moreira, 50, has been restoring WWE replica belts to make them seem like the real champion belts for two years.

“I told him to just pay shipping and I would take care of the rest. I felt like it was the right thing to do for Timmy and his family. They have been through so much.”

The package with Timmy’s belts was delivered to Moreira’s home in Edgewood, Wash. on Monday. While Moreira was ringside at a WWE Raw show, an app on his phone alerted him that two women and a driver had swiped the package from his front porch.

Determined to make good on his promise for the sick boy, Moreira went to a local news station to bring attention to the story and Timmy’s illness.

“I want them to know they took hope from a 5-year-old boy who is looking forward to that item coming back to him,” Moreira told local news station KIRO7. “You stole that from him. You broke a child’s heart.”

Moreira went on television to plead with the unidentified thieves to return the package and the Edgewood Police Department also posted surveillance footage of the theft on their Facebook, leading community members to swiftly join the rallying cry to return the package to its rightful owner.

Story continues

Just two days later, the thieves went to Moreira’s home to return the box with Timmy’s belts along with a emotional four-page apology letter.

“We are so sorry for taking your stuff. Never in a million years would I have expected I would have stolen from a sick five year old,” reads the apology letter obtained by Yahoo Lifestyle. “I have a 6 year old myself and am ashamed of what I did.”

Homeless and addicted to drugs, the women explained that they were just “trying to make a quick dollar.” After watching the news and realizing what they had done, the women decided to rectify the situation.

“We never wanted to steal a child’s hope,” reads the letter. “After seeing ourselves looking like low lives on the news, we have both decided to get clean and sober.”

The two women who stole the package later returned the belts to Sergio Moriera's home, along with a heartfelt hand-written apology letter. (Credit: Sergio Moriera)

Edgewood Police Department Chief Micah Lundborg says he was surprised but glad the outreach was effective.

“I think it says something about people deep down inside that they want to do right for themselves and their children. Hopefully, that carries on beyond just children and the whole community,” Chief Lundborg tells Yahoo Lifestyle. He adds that the Edgewood Police Department hopes to find the women to give them the help they need to get clean.

Moreira says the women were crying and seemed very sorry when they dropped off the package at his home. He gave them a big hug and told them he didn’t plan to press charges.

With the belts returned, Moreira plans to have it delivered to its rightful owner by next week.

“Timmy is going to have a belt of a lifetime,” Moreira says. “It will be something he can carry with him as a symbol of people coming together to right a wrong and it was all for him.”

To be considered a ""no-kill"" state, 90 percent of animals are either returned to owners, transferred to other shelters and rescue organizations, or adopted.

“This is an amazing first for our state,” said Deborah Schutt, MPFA founder and chairperson. “When the shelters in a state combine to meet the 90% target, that state is considered No-Kill for shelter animals. Only Delaware, which has three shelters, compared to 174 in Michigan, also reached the No Kill benchmark last year.”

In 2018, Michigan reached that percentage.

“While it’s exciting to see Michigan as a state achieve No-Kill status by reaching the 90% goal, we still have a few communities struggling to save lives, especially with cats,” Schutt said. “We will continue to work with shelters and rescue organizations to implement best practices, decrease overall length of stay in the shelter and improve the quality of life for homeless pets while they are in a shelter.”

The Michigan Pet Fund Alliance (MPFA) began tracking these statistics in 2009 from annual reports submitted by shelters to the Michigan Department of Agriculture & Rural Development.

According to the MPFA, approximately 120,000 dogs and cats were being euthanized in Michigan shelters every year.

The MPFA said that number is now just over 13,000.",https://www.wilx.com/content/news/Michigan-is-a-No-Kill-state-for-shelter-animals--559845821.html
He has talked more than 200 people off the ledge of the Golden Gate Bridge,Police officer called the 'Guardian of the Golden Gate Bridge' has talked more than 200 people out of jumping off it,1.0,"Kevin Briggs has been called the ""Guardian of the Golden Gate Bridge"".

He got the nickname while working as a California Highway Patrol officer for more than 23 years. Briggs spent most of that time positioned on the Golden Gate Bridge.

But the job turned out to be a lot more than he originally thought he was signing up for.

When Briggs started out in 1994, he was trained to handle traffic incidents but had never received training on how to deal with people contemplating suicide.

He didn't know at the time how pervasive the issue of suicide on the bridge was.

""There were four to six cases of suicidal folks on the bridge each and every month. And I had no idea about this, and I grew up in Marin County, which connects to San Francisco via that Golden Gate Bridge...I had no training to handle these types of situations.""

Briggs says in his first encounter with a suicidal person he ""did about everything wrong that you could"".

""In the back of my mind I was thinking, 'Am I responsible if she does jump? What happens here? I had no training in this. This is a really bad scene.'...I was afraid, I didn't know how to handle that situation.""

Briggs says he learned a lot from the encounters that followed.

""I think my approach right from the start was wrong. Just to walk up right to those folks and start talking with them. Now what I do is I stand back and I'll just introduce myself. I'll say 'Hi I'm Kevin' or 'I'm Kevin with the Highway Patrol, is it okay, is it alright if I come up and speak with you for a bit?' I want to get their permission and empower them.""

Since then, Kevin has talked to more than 200 people standing on the edge of the bridge.

One of those people is Kevin Berthia.

""He was very, very, very angry,"" says Briggs, ""And he wanted nothing to do with me. And he kept yelling at me 'Stay back! Stay back, if you come one step further I'm jumping!' And he was very serious about this. In my mind, if I took one step further then he was gone.""

The two spoke for more than 90 minutes about the problems Berthia was facing in his life. Briggs says he only spoke for about four or five minutes during the entire conversation. Eventually, Berthia decided to come back over and Briggs helped him over the edge and congratulated him.

""I asked him... 'What happened here? What was the turning point in this? What did I do that helped this situation? And what did I do that wasn't so good that hurt this situation?' And all he told me was, 'You listened. You let me speak, and you listened.' And that's all he was looking for and that's all that many, many people are looking for is someone to listen.""

Briggs says he thinks people contemplating suicide don't want to hear things like, ""You'll get over it,"" and, ""It's going to get better"".

""What I believe, personally, they want to hear is, 'Yeah, it is tough'.""

""I try to explain to them, wow that sounds really tough. And normalize their situation. That's a real big one, is to try to normalize their situation. You know, 'Wow, what you're going through is a whole lot of stuff and that'd be tough on anybody. I think anyone going through all that might be thinking about suicide'.

""It takes a lot of courage to be over that rail. It takes a lot of courage. But it also takes a lot of courage to come back and face the reality that is with them right now. But there is a brighter side to this, and it can happen, and it might take a long time and a lot of work. But life is beautiful and, you know, it is worth living.""



Briggs says that although he can't fix any of the issues that people are dealing with, it is important to listen and to try to understand what they are going through.

Briggs retired from the California Highway Patrol in 2013, and he now works in suicide prevention.

New Texas laws: Illegal to send unsolicited nude photos,"New Texas laws: Illegal to send unsolicited nude photos, starting today.",1.0,"article

As states push to criminalize the sharing of intimate photos to get revenge on former sex partners, Texas is teaming with Bumble to crack down on people who send unsolicited nude images on dating apps and elsewhere in cyberspace.

The new Texas law banning so-called cyber flashing comes after state Rep. Morgan Meyer of Dallas collaborated with the Austin-based social and dating application company to shepherd a bill earlier this year.

""They had a number of people who were using the app complaining about the sending of these images and they quickly realized there was no recourse,"" Meyer said, recalling how Bumble CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd approached him about crafting a measure. ""There was nothing that could be done. It wasn't a criminal offense - although it was definitely digital sexual harassment.""

The law set to take effect Saturday forbids what is often characterized as technology-enabled sexual harassment. It makes electronic transmission of sexually explicit material a Class C misdemeanor with a fine of up to $500 if the person who received it hasn't given consent.

Meyer said the law targeting unwanted images will apply to text messages, email, dating apps and social media.

A 2017 survey by Pew Research Center found women encounter sexual harassment online at much higher rates than men. The study found 21% of women ages 18 to 29 report being sexually harassed online compared to 9% of men in the same age group. Roughly 53% of those women said someone has sent them explicit images they didn't ask for.

Caroline Ellis Roche, Bumble's chief of staff, said the company plans to take the legislation to the federal level and other states in hopes of enacting it more broadly.

The Cyber Civil Rights Initiative reports that 46 states have laws tackling so-called revenge porn, but almost none combat unsolicited sexually explicit images.

A handful of other states have laws criminalizing the electronic messaging of lewd content, but most of them are linked to the sender's intentions.

Washington, Pennsylvania and New Jersey have laws against cyberstalking, which is defined by intent to harass, said Pam Greenberg, a senior fellow for the National Conference of State Legislatures. In South Carolina, it's illegal to anonymously send any lewd content without the consent of the person receiving it.

Bumble, which bills itself as a feminist dating app where women make the first move, isn't the first dating app company to take on a legislative effort.

Match Group, which owns multiple dating app companies, helped pursue legislation that was passed in California and Vermont, according to its website. The California legislation requires all online dating platforms to post safety tips, and Vermont's requires the platforms to notify users where they engaged with another user who was removed for fraud.

Austin-based attorney J.T. Morris, who specializes in First Amendment cases, said the Texas law will face enforcement difficulties as well as legal challenges for being overly broad and vague.

""It reaches things that arguably could cover images related to medical advice or moms sharing information about breastfeeding or their babies' health - things like that which certainly can't be criminalized,"" Morris said.

Roche said Bumble understands enforcing the law will be a challenge, but the Texas legislation is intended to serve as a deterrent.",http://www.fox4news.com/news/texas/new-texas-laws-illegal-to-send-unsolicited-nude-photos
Unanimous Legislature passes 2 bills to reduce ‘welfare cliff’,"Unanimous Maine Legislature passes 2 bills to reduce ‘welfare cliff’ - The bills, sponsored by Democratic and Republican leaders, are designed to let families keep some welfare benefits as they gradually gain more independence and income.",1.0,"AUGUSTA — A pair of bills aimed at lessening the impact of the so-called “welfare cliff” easily cleared the Legislature Tuesday with unanimous votes in both the House and the Senate.

The bills, called the Invest in Tomorrow package, are aimed at keeping families that are transitioning from welfare to work from losing health, financial and education benefits until they are earning enough to fully support themselves.

One of the measures raises the income limits for Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, while the other allows those enrolled in state-funded education and job-training programs to gradually earn more money before losing all assistance. The bills are sponsored by House Speaker Sara Gideon, D-Freeport, and Assistant House Minority Leader Trey Stewart, R-Presque Isle.

The term welfare cliff refers to the total loss of benefits that can occur when someone achieves even a relatively low level of income. Supporters of the bills say losing benefits because of a relatively minor increase in income is a disincentive for people seeking a higher-paying job or to gain skills that allow them to earn more.

Gideon, in her testimony to lawmakers in support of one of the bills, said a family of three must have a gross income of less than $12,276 to qualify for TANF. Under the bill approved Tuesday, the same family of three would qualify for TANF if its income was up to 88 percent of the federal poverty line, or $18,870 per year.

Stewart’s bill increases the earnings limit for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps, while allowing a TANF recipient to apply the time spent studying for a General Equivalency Diploma toward work and education requirements.

“We have the chance to make real, positive change in the lives of Mainers experiencing poverty – for families who are struggling and only want better, brighter futures for themselves and their kids,” Gideon said in a prepared statement. “If we make the investments that are called for in these bills, we’re going to see the dividends pay off in a big way for our state’s economy today and in the years to come.”

A coalition of organizations that advocate for the poor in Maine praised the votes Tuesday, urging Maine Gov. Janet Mills to sign the bills into law.

“Passing these bills is the first big step to advance the Invest in Tomorrow policy agenda to increase economic security and opportunity for Maine kids and families, which reflects the thinking of community members, stakeholders and experts all over the state,” said Robyn Merrill, executive director of Maine Equal Justice. “The bipartisan effort we’ve seen to make a real difference for Maine families in our state is inspiring. It shows that poverty is not a partisan issue, it’s something we all care about.”

Dana Connors, the president of the Maine State Chamber of Commerce, which also backed the bill package as part of the coalition, said the legislation will help Maine employers by increasing the workforce and equipping workers with more skills.

“With the passage of these bills, it’s great to know that the state will not only be doing the right things to help Maine families and young children succeed, we’ll also be making an investment in the future of our workforce,” Connors said, also in a prepared statement.

Stewart, in his testimony to the Legislature, said the measures are meant to encourage people to seek work.

“These hard-working individuals have aspirations for themselves and their families that far exceed their current situation and status,” Stewart said. “They simply need a targeted and coordinated hand-up, along with some good advice from experts in this area in order to make it happen.”

The two measures, funded with $11 million a year from federal block grants, now head to Mills’ desk.

"Eight-Year-Old Mexican Girl Bullied For Being ""Weird"" Has An IQ Of 162","Mexican Girl Bullied For Being “Weird” Has A Higher IQ Than Einstein, So Let’s Protect Her Instead Of Giving Her A Supervillain Origin Story",1.0,"She may have had a difficult past, but Mexico City resident Adhara Pérez has a bright future. At just eight years old, she already has an IQ of 162— higher than both Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking, who each had an IQ of about 160.

Now, the little girl has written a book about her experiences (Do Not Give Up is the rough translation), and was recently featured in Forbes México‘s 100 Most Powerful Women in Mexico list. She’s even working on a smart bracelet that will monitor the emotions of differently-abled children.

But it took a long time before Pérez’s extraordinary gifts were recognized.

After being diagnosed with Asperger’s disorder at three years old—a developmental disorder that oftentimes causes difficulties with social interaction and communication—the little girl faced bullying and harassment from the other kids at school.

Pérez was “made a joke at school,” reports The Digital Weekly, and her mother Nallely Sanchez said: “I witnessed that Adhara was playing in a little house, and they bolted her up. And they began to chant: ‘Oddball, weirdo!'”

The bullying got so bad that Pérez fell into “intense” depression and stopped wanting to go to school. Teachers said when she did go to class, she would often fall asleep and daydream.

It wasn’t until her mother took her to therapy that Pérez’ unusually high IQ was discovered and she was placed into classes according to her abilities.

Her rare intelligence allowed Pérez to finish elementary school at five years of age, middle school at six, and high school at eight. She is currently studying two online degrees: Industrial Engineering in Mathematics at UNITEC and Systems Engineering by CNCI, and she dreams of entering the University of Arizona to study astrophysics in the near future, according to The Yucatan Times.",https://tanksgoodnews.com/2019/11/18/adhara-perez/
"Thunberg donates $100,000 to support children during pandemic","Greta Thunberg has donated a $100,000 prize she won from a Danish foundation to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) for use against the COVID-19 pandemic.",1.0,"Advertising Read more

United Nations (United States) (AFP)

Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg has donated a $100,000 prize she won from a Danish foundation to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) for use against the COVID-19 pandemic, the world body said Thursday.

""Like the climate crisis, the coronavirus pandemic is a child rights crisis,"" Thunberg, 17, was quoted as saying in the UNICEF statement.

""It will affect all children, now and in the long term, but vulnerable groups will be impacted the most,"" she added.

""I'm asking everyone to step up and join me in support of UNICEF's vital work to save children's lives, to protect health and continue education.""

The Danish anti-poverty non-governmental organization, Human Act, will match the $100,000 donation, the statement added.

UNICEF said the funds would give it a boost as it struggles to support children impacted by anti-virus lockdowns and school closures, particularly in the fields of ""food shortages, strained health care systems, violence and lost education.""

Thunberg said at the end of March that she had ""likely"" contracted the coronavirus, after experiencing several symptoms after a trip to central Europe.

U.S. Marshals Find DOZENS of Missing Children in Georgia,U.S. Marshals Find DOZENS of Missing Children in Georgia - Breaking911,1.0,"Washington, DC – The U.S. Marshals Service Missing Child Unit, in conjunction with the agency’s Southeast Regional Fugitive Task Force, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) and Georgia state and local agencies, led a two-week operation in August in Atlanta and Macon, Georgia, to rescue endangered missing children.

“Operation Not Forgotten” resulted in the rescue of 26 children, the safe location of 13 children and the arrest of nine criminal associates. Additionally, investigators cleared 26 arrest warrants and filed additional charges for alleged crimes related to sex trafficking, parental kidnapping, registered sex offender violations, drugs and weapons possession, and custodial interference. The 26 warrants cleared included 19 arrest warrants for a total of nine individuals arrested, some of whom had multiple warrants.

“The U.S. Marshals Service is fully committed to assisting federal, state, and local agencies with locating and recovering endangered missing children, in addition to their primary fugitive apprehension mission,” said Director of the Marshals Service Donald Washington. “The message to missing children and their families is that we will never stop looking for you.”

These missing children were considered to be some of the most at-risk and challenging recovery cases in the area, based on indications of high-risk factors such as victimization of child sex trafficking, child exploitation, sexual abuse, physical abuse, and medical or mental health conditions. Other children were located at the request of law enforcement to ensure their wellbeing. USMS investigators were able to confirm each child’s location in person and assure their safety and welfare.

The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 enhanced the U.S. Marshals’ authority to assist federal, state, and local law enforcement with the recovery of missing, endangered or abducted children, regardless of whether a fugitive or sex offender was involved. The Marshals established a Missing Child Unit to oversee and manage the implementation of its enhanced authority under the act.

In 2019, the USMS helped recover 295 missing children based on requests for assistance from law enforcement and has contributed to the recovery of a missing child in 75 percent of cases received. Additionally, of the missing children recovered, 66 percent were recovered within seven days of the USMS assisting with the case. Since its partnership with NCMEC began in 2005, the agency has recovered more than 1,800 missing children.

“When we track down fugitives, it’s a good feeling to know that we’re putting the bad guy behind bars. But that sense of accomplishment is nothing compared to finding a missing child,” said Darby Kirby, Chief of the Missing Child Unit. “It’s hard to put into words what we feel when we rescue a missing child, but I can tell you that this operation has impacted every single one of us out here. We are working to protect them and get them the help they need.”

This initiative was the culmination of several months of planning and coordination between the USMS, NCMEC, Georgia Bureau of Investigation, Georgia Office of the Attorney General, Georgia Department of Family and Children Services, Georgia Department of Juvenile Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta.

Jacinda Ardern and ministers take pay cut in solidarity with those hit by Covid-19,"Jacinda Ardern and ministers take 20% pay cut in solidarity with those hit by Covid-19 | New Zealand PM says: ‘If there was ever a time to close the gap between groups of people across New Zealand in different positions, it is now’",1.0,"New Zealand’s prime minister has said she and other ministers will take a 20% pay cut lasting six months to show solidarity with those affected by the coronavirus outbreak, as the death toll continues to rise.

Jacinda Ardern said it was important the government’s most highly paid politicians show “leadership and solidarity” with workers on the frontline and those who had lost their livelihoods. Ardern, government ministers and public service chief executives will take the cut for six months, effective immediately.

The pay cut will reduce Ardern’s salary by $47,104. Cabinet ministers would take a cut of NZ$26,900 each, while deputy prime minister Winston Peters’ salary would be cut by $33,473.

Dr Ashley Bloomfield, the director-general of health who has led the elimination response to the crisis, confirmed he would “definitely” take a pay cut too, as would opposition leader Simon Bridges.

Ardern said: “If there was ever a time to close the gap between groups of people across New Zealand in different positions, it is now. I am responsible for the executive branch and this is where we can take action … it is about showing solidarity in New Zealand’s time of need.”

Ardern accepted the cut would not influence the government’s overall fiscal position: “This was always just going to be an acknowledgement of the hit that many New Zealanders will be taking at the moment.”

New Zealand has been in full lockdown for three weeks, meaning no one is allowed to leave their homes except for necessities or a brief respite of fresh air. More than 1,300 people have been infected with the virus, and there have been nine deaths, all older people with pre-existing health conditions.

A total of 1.5 million people have claimed the government’s wage subsidy to help them weather a temporary loss of income. Modelling from Treasury has suggested that a prolonged and strict lockdown could see one in four New Zealanders out of work in the worst-case scenario. A swift end to the lockdown along with a further government stimulus package could reduce joblessness to 8.5%. Currently, unemployment stands at 4%.

The International Monetary Fund is forecasting that the New Zealand economy will shrink by 7.2% this year. In its World Economic Outlook, it says New Zealand will see the biggest economic contraction outside Europe, except for Venezuela.

Also on Wednesday, the epidemic response committee heard from major media players about the challenges they were facing under lockdown, which had seen Stuff and NZME lose more than 50% of their advertising revenue, and NZME lay off 200 staff and order those remaining to take a 15% pay cut for three months.

Stuff chief executive Sinead Boucher told the committee that 2 million New Zealanders visited its website every day, and it and other domestic news media were playing a “crucial” role in providing quality news throughout the crisis, and debunking fake news that had mushroomed online.

“There is an immediate need to survive these next few months,” Boucher said, adding she was unable to rule out redundancies. “There needs to be some kind of ongoing government support for a commercial media industry in New Zealand.”

A government rescue package for the media is expected this week.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/jacinda-ardern-and-ministers-take-20-pay-cut-in-solidarity-with-those-hit-by-covid-19
"'Jeopardy!' champion donates more than $10,000 to cancer center in honor of Alex Trebek","'Jeopardy!' champion donates more than $10,000 to cancer center in honor of Alex Trebek",1.0,"Avi Gupta, 18, said the donation was in honor of Alex Trebek, who is fighting pancreatic cancer.

PORTLAND, Ore. (KGW) — In a moment akin to Final Jeopardy, Avi Gupta took pen in hand Monday, and went for it. But instead of a winning question, Gupta, 18, wrote out a $10,314 donation check to Oregon Health & Science University's Knight Cancer Institute.

“This is in honor of 'Jeopardy' host Alex Trebek, a man who's been a role model for me my whole life,” said Gupta, referring to Trebek’s battle with pancreatic cancer.

Last June, the Catlin Gable grad and Columbia University freshman, won the 'Jeopardy' Teen Tournament and the $100,000 grand prize. Money for his donation came from part of his winnings.

“I hope it makes a difference,” said Gupta.

While Trebek battles pancreatic cancer, countless others are fighting for their lives. Gupta hopes his donation—a nod to the mathematical constant, Pi—will promote research for early detection.

“Everyone knows someone or has been affected by cancer in some way,” said Gupta. “I believe scientists are winning the fight against cancer, we just need to help them to do more.”

Dr. Brian Druker is director of the Knight Cancer Institute. He and his wife were so inspired by Gupta’s donation, they pledged to match it—a true “Daily Double.”

“What a remarkable young man and what a great gesture,” said Druker. “We hope it inspires lots and lots more people.”

Druker said he believes it can, in much the same way the Knight Cancer challenge did. That campaign raised $500 million, through 10,000 individual donors.

“There were bake sales, lemonade stands, my daughter donated $16,” said Druker. “Those are the people who inspire all of us to give small amounts and it all starts to add up.”

With each contribution, donors are encouraged to document their giving with hashtag #InspiredBy, to recognize who they're donating in honor of.

“I really hope that others—young people, especially—will join me in supporting this cause,” said Gupta. “We are the social media generation.”

You can count Dr. Druker.

“I'm going to write #InspiredBy Avi Gupta,” said Druker. ""Because he is absolutely an inspiration.”",https://www.10tv.com/article/jeopardy-champion-donates-more-10000-cancer-center-honor-alex-trebek-2019-nov
India's only openly gay prince discusses coming out and turning his pink palace into a centre for at-risk LGBT+ people,India's only openly gay prince discusses coming out and turning his pink palace into a centre for at-risk LGBT+ people,1.0,"Prince Manvendra Singh Gohil might have grown up in a vast and opulent rococo palace in prosperous Gujarat with servants responding to his every beck and call but it would be wrong to assume his life has been free of problems.

The Indian prince, who is the son and probable heir of the Maharaja of Rajpipla in Gujarat in western India, was forced to shroud his sexuality from public view for years. Marrying a princess of Jhabua State in Madhya Pradesh in 1991, Prince Manvendra lived a lie and his matrimony remained unconsummated for its entirety.

Unable to endure the secrecy, he eventually confided in his wife about his sexual orientation. Barely a year after the wedding she filed for divorce despite separation being virtually unheard of in India at the time and still massively taboo now.

Like many in India – where sex between people of the same gender is punishable by law – the 52-year-old kept his homosexuality a secret from everyone for many years after the divorce. Fortunately his wife kept her promise to never divulge his sexuality.

But this was not easy and in 2002 Prince Manvendra had a nervous breakdown and found himself in hospital. It was there that his psychiatrist told his parents he was gay. This did not go down well and his parents insisted his sexuality must be kept a secret. They tried to “cure” him with both medical and religious measures.

If this was not bad enough the prince’s life was thrown into yet further disarray and chaos after he publicly came out as gay. The revelation was not only breaking news all over India but also grabbed headlines worldwide. In his home state of Rajpipla, effigies of the prince were burned and people called for him to be robbed of his title and ostracised. His parents brought out public notices saying they wanted to publicly disown him and disinherit him from the ancestral property.

“Coming out in India is very difficult. There is so much stigma. Society doesn’t allow parents to accept it,” the prince, who is the first and only openly gay royal in India, tells The Independent.

“Parents blackmail their children and force them to get married to the opposite sex. People in the community tell me their mothers have threatened to kill themselves if they are gay. They do not want their mother to jump into a well so they are pressured to get married.”

The royal said homelessness is a massive problem in the LGBT+ community in India. “People in India are so attached to their parents they are not able to live without them. When they try and come out parents do not understand and disown their children and throw them out of the home. The children don’t know where to go and are homeless,” he said.

“I need to rescue these people who have been rendered homeless otherwise they will die, commit suicide, or get depressed.”

Prince Manvendra is not talking in vague, nebulous terms and actually has a solution in mind. The royal is going so far as to transform his 15-acre pink palace into a centre for vulnerable LGBT+ people.

The centre aims to deliver clinical services, financial support and skills training for young LGBT+ people so they are able to become financially independent from their families. He will run the centre with his community-based organisation The Lakshya Trust which he started to support gay men and educate people about the prevention of HIV/Aids.

“There are two aims. One is social empowerment and the other is economic empowerment,” he explains. “The idea is to teach people how to become self-reliant so they can earn their own living based on their skills and talents. There is a lot of discrimination which the community faces so we want people to feel confident.”

The royal, who says he has been thinking about the idea for 15 years, also plans to use the centre to offer free safe-sex seminars to young LGBT+ people across India and run workshops with parents who have accepted their children’s sexuality. He is constructing more buildings to house visitors to the centre who will be able to stay in shared accommodation.

The aptness of the palace being pink is not lost on Prince Manvendra. “Our city is called the pink city of Gujarat and most of the buildings are painted pink,” he explains. “It has been pink for almost 300 years now and I always say maybe one of my ancestors painted it pink because they knew one of their relatives would like it.”

He says the palace was visited by many Hollywood stars back in the day and that Ian Fleming, who wrote the James Bond series of spy novels, visited the palace as he was a friend of his great-grandfather’s.

But the prince is not getting the centre up and running on his own and has procured the support of Kanwar Amarjit Singh – a 28-year-old Indian royal who is also an LGBT+ activist.

Prince Manvendra is so appreciative of Mr Singh’s decision to help with funding he has named the centre after him – it will be called Hanumanteshwar Amar 1927. Mr Singh, who divides his time between India and London, describes the prince as his “mentor” and explains their ancestors were great friends.

Mr Singh, who runs a feminist art gallery near Kings Cross in London called Amar Gallery currently showing Guerrilla Girls artwork, was driven out of India at the age of just 20 after he spoke out about supporting gay rights – though he himself is heterosexual. The activist, who is the main funder and support of Prince Manvendra's LGBT centre, runs a grassroots network of activists in India that confronts the oppression of the LGBT+ community and women through education.

“We work on advocacy for LGBT+ and women’s rights,” Mr Singh says. “It makes me so angry the police in some townships are beating gay men and people for handing out condoms, and girls as young as four being forced into prostitution"".

“We connected a decade ago and he has been a champion for LGBT+ rights since I have known him. I consider him as an ally,” Prince Manvendra chips in.

Over in India Prince Manvendra also emphasises the importance of education and uses his platform to speak to university students about LGBT+ issues. In fact, the royal has had something of a turnaround since coming out and being shunned by society after coming out.

He has not only been accepted by his family but has been on The Oprah Winfrey Show three times and even appeared on Keeping Up With The Kardashians.

“Oprah’s interview was a big turning point in my life,” he reflects. “The whole of society had turned against me but the moment I got invited on things changed. She was extremely nice to me, said she had interviewed many people in the last 25 years, but I was one of the most honest people she had ever met.”

Despite the progress Prince Manvendra has made and continues to make in India, it is worth remembering that Indian law continues to criminalise sexual acts between members of the same sex and homophobia remains deeply culturally ingrained. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court of India has ordered a review of the legislation later this year.

In Prince Manvendra’s view, the problem is rooted in Indian society’s attitude to sex as a whole. “It is a taboo to even speak about sex and there is no sex education in schools,” he says.

Ironically the prince, who campaigns for the reform of India’s anti-LGBT+ laws, says homosexual behaviour is far more accepted than heterosexual behaviour in the country. “Men are affectionate with each other but heterosexual behaviour is not accepted,” he explains. “Our country is a paradox in that way. It is very easy to get a room for same sex at a hotel but if a male and female want a room you have to prove the relationship.

“There are so many people in the closet living a double life; you’re supposed to live the way society wants you to live”.",http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/india-openly-gay-prince-mavendra-coming-out-pink-palace-lgbt-centre-vulnerable-people-interview-a8202921.html
"Forest-powered biofuel flight heads to Washington, D.C.","Alaska Airlines today made history flying the first commercial flight using the world’s first renewable, alternative jet fuel made from forest residuals, the limbs and branches that remain after the harvesting of managed forests.",1.0,"SEATTLE – Washington state-based Alaska Airlines today made history flying the first commercial flight using the world’s first renewable, alternative jet fuel made from forest residuals, the limbs and branches that remain after the harvesting of managed forests.

The alternative jet fuel was produced through the efforts of the Washington State University-led Northwest Advanced Renewables Alliance (NARA).

The demonstration flight departed Seattle-Tacoma International Airport this morning for Reagan National Airport in Washington, D.C. The flight was fueled with a 20 percent blend of sustainable aviation biofuel, which is chemically indistinguishable from regular jet A fuel. The flight, the first commercial passenger flight of its kind, continues to advance viable alternatives to conventional fossil fuels for aviation.

Reducing carbon footprint

“This latest milestone in Alaska’s efforts to promote sustainable biofuels is especially exciting since it is uniquely sourced from the forest residuals in the Pacific Northwest,” said Joe Sprague, Alaska Airlines’ senior vice president of communications and external relations. “NARA’s accomplishments and the investment of the U.S. Department of Agriculture provide another key in helping Alaska Airlines and the aviation industry reduce its carbon footprint and dependency on fossil fuels.”

While the 1,080 gallons of biofuel used on the flight has a minimal impact to Alaska Airlines’ overall greenhouse gas emissions, if the airline were able to replace 20 percent of its entire fuel supply at Sea-Tac Airport, it would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by about 142,000 metric tons of CO2. This is equivalent to taking approximately 30,000 passenger vehicles off the road for one year.

NARA is a five-year project that launched in 2011 and is comprised of 32 member organizations from industry, academia and government laboratories. Today’s flight represents its efforts to develop alternative jet fuel derived from post-harvest forestry material that is often burned after timber harvest.

The forest residual feedstock used to power Alaska Airlines Flight 4 was sourced from tribal lands and private forestry operations in the Pacific Northwest. In addition to producing 1,080 gallons of biofuel used for the flight, other key tasks of the project included evaluating the economic, environmental and societal benefits and impacts associated with harvesting unused forest residuals for biofuel production.

Empowering regional, rural economies

The NARA initiative was made possible by a $39.6 million grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) to support research on biofuels and biochemicals, foster regional supply chain coalitions, empower rural economic development and educate the public on the benefits of bioenergy.

“Today is a tribute to all of our NARA partners, and especially to NIFA who supported our mission to facilitate the revolutionary development of biojet and bioproduct industries in the Pacific Northwest using forest residuals that would otherwise become waste products,” said Ralph Cavalieri, NARA executive director. “We are proud of every one of the partners and stakeholders – from forest managers to Gevo and Alaska Airlines – who have laid the foundations for a renewable fuel economy that will keep skies clear and healthy with the potential to bolster economically challenged timber-based rural communities in our region.”

Gevo, Inc., a NARA partner, successfully adapted its patented technologies to convert cellulosic sugars derived from wood waste into renewable isobutanol, which was then converted into Gevo’s Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) fuel. Believed to be the world’s first alternative jet fuel produced from wood, the fuel meets international ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) standards, allowing it to be used safely for today’s commercial flight.

WSU among many partners, stakeholders

“This first of its kind flight demonstrates Gevo’s commitment and ability to convert a wide range of sugar feedstocks into drop-in renewable fuels,” said Pat Gruber, Gevo’s chief executive officer. “We are pleased that we had the opportunity to prove, through the NARA project, that cellulosic sugars from wood can be used to successfully make commercial jet fuel. We congratulate our fellow NARA partners and thank the USDA-NIFA for its unwavering support in the pursuit of renewable jet fuel. I also thank Alaska Airlines, which continues to be a great partner.”

Several elected officials joined the 163 passengers on the Alaska Airlines Boeing 737-800 jet bound for the nation’s capital, including U.S. Rep. Suzan DelBene (WA-1), U.S. Rep. Dave Reichert (WA-8) and U.S. Rep. Denny Heck (WA-10).

“I am proud to see the world’s first biojet fuel made from forest residuals being flown on an Alaska Airlines airplane,” said U.S. Sen. Patty Murray. “The Pacific Northwest continues to be on the cutting edge of new technology that will make airplanes better, safer and more efficient, and I’m thrilled that so many stakeholders came together and that Washington State University has led this important effort.”

Expanding global competitiveness

“Today’s flight comes after years of investments to help the aviation biofuels industry take off,” said U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell. “By creating these sustainable biofuels, we will revitalize our rural agricultural communities, foster economic growth, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and cut our dependence on foreign oil while growing our competitiveness in global markets.”

“Today’s flight demonstrates that Washington state’s innovation economy is once again at the forefront of collaborative, transformative research by using material that would otherwise be discarded to create a new biofuel,” said DelBene. “Here in the Pacific Northwest, we know that the natural environment that surrounds us is what makes living here so special. We have a tremendous opportunity in our region to build a new green economy and find innovative solutions to address climate change for our health and future generations, as this project highlights.”

"Pampas Grass Eradicated from Hawai’i Island, BIISC Reports",The invasive pampas grass has been uprooted from all known locations on Hawai’i Island. The Big Island Invasive Species Committee announced the eradication of the grass on Tuesday.,1.0,"The invasive pampas grass has been uprooted from all known locations on Hawai’i Island.

The Big Island Invasive Species Committee announced the eradication of the grass on Tuesday. Two species of pampas grass occur in Hawai‘i, Cortaderia jubata and Cortaderia selloana; both are on the state’s Noxious Weeds list.

Removal of the plants by BIISC crews took time, as permission from property owners was required for most of the sites, according to a BIISC press release.

“Locating and contacting property owners can pose a significant challenge for control efforts, but overall most homeowners were cooperative and eager to support the removal of an invasive plant from their property,” the release stated.

Hawai‘i Department of Agriculture assisted with securing access for removal where permission was difficult to obtain. When BIISC crews removed the last known plant in 2019, they replanted the area with native mamaki.

ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW AD

Although most of the adult plants were removed early in the eradication timeline, Joel Brunger, the field operations supervisor for BIISC, explains that with a potential seed spread of up to 20 miles, surveying for pampas grass near known locations required a significant investment of time.

ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW AD

“After the adult plants are removed, we have to return and conduct sweeps regularly for new sprouting keiki for as long as the seeds are viable,” Brunger said. “For pampas grass, that’s six years.”

BIISC said pampas grass is still sold throughout the world in the horticultural trade and for landscaping. During the course of the eradication effort, BIISC developed the Plant Pono program, a nursery endorsement and education effort aimed at stopping the sale of invasive plants in Hawai‘i.

Plant Pono-endorsed nurseries voluntarily pledge to sell only non-invasive “pono” plants. There have been no sales of pampas grass in Hawaii for the last several years, although seeds purchased online continue to be a risk for introductions of invasive plants.

ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW AD

“People often look at widespread invasive plants like albizia or clidemia and say, why didn’t anyone do something about it before it became this bad?” asked Franny Brewer, communications director for BIISC. “That’s what we’re trying to do. Identify what has come in that is potentially the next serious problem, and remove it before it has decades to spread.”

Brewer explains that once a harmful species reaches a certain point, complete eradication becomes so expensive — in the tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars — that removal of the species is no longer feasible.

Currently, BIISC is targeting a number of other plants for eradication, including Mollucca raspberry, a thorny, sprawling brush species, and a holly tree that can establish in native forest areas.

As with pampas grass, public reports are a critical tool in efforts to eradicate invasive plants. To learn how to identify and report target species, visit www.biisc.org.",https://bigislandnow.com/2020/09/23/pampas-grass-eradicated-from-hawaii-island-biisc-reports/
The Largest Ever Tropical Reforestation Is Planting 73 Million Trees,"The largest reforestation project in history will see 73 million trees planted in the Brazilian Amazon across land the size of 30,000 soccer fields",1.0,"advertisement advertisement

There are more habitable planets in our galaxy than humans living on planet Earth. But the nearest one is about 70 trillion miles away, which means that, for now, and for the foreseeable future, Earth is the only life-supporting rock hurtling through infinite space we’ll ever know. It’s really not the best idea to let it burn up–and key to keeping it cool are the massive rainforests of the Amazon. Sadly, we’ve had a hard time not cutting them down.

A new project should help prevent–or at least slow down–that hot future. If all goes to plan over the next six years, a project led by Conservation International will become the largest tropical reforestation project in history. Seventy-three million trees will sprout up across what’s known as the “arc of deforestation,” in the Brazilian states of Amazonas, Acre, Pará, Rondônia, and throughout the Xingu watershed. The short-term plan is to restore 70,000 acres (the area of 30,000 soccer fields) that have been cleared for pastureland to their former forested glory.

“If the world is to hit the 1.2°C or 2°C [degrees of warming] target that we all agreed to in Paris, then protecting tropical forests in particular has to be a big part of that,” M. Sanjayan, CEO of Conservation International, tells Fast Company. “It’s not just the trees that matter, but what kind of trees. If you’re really thinking about getting carbon dioxide out of atmosphere, then tropical forests are the ones that end up mattering the most.” He’s right: Simply stopping deforestation could allow existing forests to absorb up to 37% of our annual carbon emissions; replenishing degraded areas could do significantly more for the planet.

advertisement

“This is not a stunt,” Sanjayan says. “It is a carefully controlled experiment to literally figure out how to do tropical restoration at scale, so that people can replicate it and we can drive the costs down dramatically.” Over the past 40 years, about 20% of the Amazon has been cut down or destroyed, and scientists worry that another 20% of the rainforest will be lost in the next couple of decades. So, instead of following precedent and planting saplings, which are labor and resource intensive to manage (and, depending on the selected species, may not be best-suited for the territory, resulting in less than ideal survival rates), the organizing coalition is trying something different.

Developed in Brazil only a few years ago, the new planting technique is called muvuca. “In Portuguese, it means a lot of people in a very small place,” says Rodrigo Medeiros, Conservation International’s vice president of the Brazil program and the lead on the ground.

The muvuca strategy demands that seeds from more than 200 native forest species are spread over every square meter of burnt and mismanaged land. The seeds are purchased from the Xingu Seed Network, which since 2007 has acted as a native seed supply for more than 30 organizations, thanks a collection of more than 400 seed collectors–many of whom are indigenous women and local youths. Of course, even in nitrogen- and phosphorus-rich soil, only some of these seeds will survive–but that bit of natural selection is key to the muvuca magic. Several seeds germinate, compete between themselves for nutrients and sunlight, and the strongest ultimately become big trees. According to a 2014 study by the Food and Agriculture Organization and Bioversity International, more than 90% of native tree species planted with this strategy germinate, and they’re especially resilient, able to survive drought conditions for up to six months without irrigation. “With plant-by-plant reforestation techniques, you get a typical density of about 160 plants per hectare,” says Medeiros. “With muvuca, the initial outcome is 2,500 species per hectare. And after 10 years, you can reach 5,000 trees per hectare. It’s much more diverse, much more dense, and less expensive than traditional techniques.”

Working alongside Conservation International are the Brazilian Ministry of Environment, the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the World Bank, the Brazilian Biodiversity Fund (Funbio), and Rock in Rio’s environmental arm “Amazonia Live.” While this coalition provides the high-level leadership, it’s actually indigenous communities and small family farmers who have ownership of this project. In any given hectare, as many as 2,000 locals will be actively working together to reforest the land–typically private farmland but also government-owned protected zones and indigenous territories. Pay is issued evenly among participants, and families can earn about $700 per hectare reforested. The finances are typically managed by a local NGO in the field, with support from project sponsors. Already a couple million trees have been planted, and it’s a win-win situation for all involved parties, says Medeiros. The coalition gets labor at a fair price. Indigenous communities can maintain their livelihoods and get recognition as the rightful owners of rainforest land. And farmers sign partnership agreements to fast-track recovery on their own land with logistical support. “Springs, rivers, and streams that were suffering from the lack of water are already beginning to show signs of recovery in the region,” says Medeiros, which has led to more productive soil and better yields for farmers, too.

Teen Activists — The sisters who convinced Bali to ban plastic bags,Have you heard about the plastic bag ban in Bali? But did you know it's partly because of two teen sisters who have been campaigning for years to rid their island of plastic,1.0,"India’s crisis: a case study

Among the developing countries, India has stood out during the crisis. Due to its vast number of vaccine companies, and long history of successful inoculation drives, the country was expected to curb the pandemic—and it appeared to be weathering the crisis well compared to other nations. Unfortunately, that changed quickly. Attempts made by the government to push certain vaccines backfired, as safety concerns grew, reducing public trust. As a result, parts of the population refused to be vaccinated, decreasing its general effectiveness. Adding to this, India suffered distribution issues.

India’s transmission rate is now considered a global threat. At the time of writing, it accounts for about one in three of all new cases, including some of the first mutations of the virus. The monumental surge in cases is not being followed by proper inoculation. According to Our World in Data, a little over 10% of the population has had at least one dose and only about 3% is fully vaccinated.

Much of the population are enduring the worst of conditions, without proper access to medical health, food, or even shelter. According to the census of 2011, about 1.77 million people are homeless in India, and among the chaos, are left neglected. The effects of this pandemic have been felt deeply by everyone, everywhere, but this is especially true for those living in the fringes of society.

The media gives us insights into the dire situation India finds itself in. Volunteering or donating is one way to help them overcome this dark moment in history—one that many of us will have experienced first hand. The other is through cross-governmental support. Only then can we give India the resources it needs to bounce back.",https://www.kinder-world.org/articles/solutions/teen-activists-the-sisters-who-convinced-bali-to-ban-plastic-bags-18983

"Anyone in Oklahoma can now get the Covid-19 vaccine, thanks to several Native tribes","Anyone in Oklahoma can now get the Covid-19 vaccine, thanks to several Native tribes",1.0,"(CNN) Any resident of Oklahoma can now get the Covid-19 vaccine -- but it's not because of the state's health department. Instead, Oklahomans have several Native tribes to thank.

Last week, the Chickasaw Nation opened up Covid-19 vaccine appointments to all Oklahoma residents , regardless of whether they are citizens of the tribe.

Other tribes headquartered in Oklahoma have expanded vaccinations beyond tribal citizens, too. The Osage Choctaw and Citizen Potawatomi Nations are offering vaccines to all members of the public, while the Cherokee Nation has opened appointments to anyone residing within its 14-county jurisdiction.

The state of Oklahoma, meanwhile, is currently on Phase 3 of its vaccine distribution plan.

That criteria covers a wide swath of people, including healthcare workers, first responders, residents 65 and older, those with medical conditions, teachers and school staff, students 16 and older, people in congregate settings, public health staff, government officials and essential workers. Still, all residents won't be eligible under the state's plan until Phase 4.

Tribes want to reach herd immunity

the Tribal nations in Oklahoma received allotments of the vaccine fromthe Indian Health Service . As those tribes demonstrated that they were able to get shots into arms quickly, they received more and more doses -- allowing them to expand their efforts beyond their own populations.

Dr. John Krueger, chief medical officer for the Chickasaw Nation, credits the tribe's robust infrastructure for its ability to offer vaccines to non-Native members of the community.

The Chickasaw Nation recently opened a new facility in the city of Ada with 16 drive-thru lines, dramatically increasing its capacity. The tribe also has three other vaccination sites as well as a team that travels to people's homes, Krueger added.

Now that those in the Chickasaw Nation's priority groups have been offered vaccines, the tribe is able to move on to those outside the tribe.

""We are a part of these communities, and they are a part of us,"" Krueger said. ""The faster we can get all of us back to essential protection, the better it is for us and the better it is for everyone.""

The Chickasaw Nation has administered more than 30,000 vaccines to date, according to Krueger. Roughly 35,000 Chickasaw citizens live within the tribe's jurisdiction in south-central Oklahoma.

The Choctaw Nation also attributes their newfound capacity to the success they experienced in vaccinating early priority groups such as elders.

It's not necessarily an issue of supply outpacing demand, says Cpt. Clinton Bullock, director of pharmacy for the Choctaw Nation Health Care Center. Rather, the tribe is capitalizing on the resources offered by the Indian Health Service to help protect the rest of the state.

""There are, of course, non-Native members of the community that our tribal citizens come in contact with,"" Bullock said. ""Helping to develop this herd immunity not only benefits the tribal members, but the community as a whole.""

The Choctaw Nation has administered more than 20,000 vaccines, according to Bullock.

Some tribes have seen demand decline

Part of the reason some tribal nations have been able to open up vaccines to anyone who wants one is because of vaccine hesitancy.

Dr. Ronald Shaw, CEO of the Osage Nation WahZhaZhe Health Center, said the tribe's health system initially followed Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines in its vaccine distribution. After about a month, the criteria became somewhat of an obstacle, so they quickly opened up vaccines to more age groups. Eventually, they were offering shots to all non-Native people.

Despite the broad invitation, Shaw says demand has remained low, adding that people in rural parts of Osage County have seemed reluctant to get the vaccines.

""That hesitancy meant that we have more vaccine to give beyond just the Native American patients in our area, so that's translated to more vaccines for non-Indians,"" Shaw said.

Krueger said that when the Chickasaw Nation has opened up vaccinations for a particular group, there's been an initial surge in demand followed by an eventual drop-off.

The tribe is continuing to combat vaccine hesitancy within those early priority groups, Krueger said. But in the meantime, they have the resources to vaccinate others around them -- and recognize that doing so will help protect the entire community.

""We have plenty of capacity right now to not only take care of the community, but also take care of (those in the tribe's priority groups), so anybody that that needs a vaccine can get one,"" he said.

Tribes have often outpaced states in distribution

Native people get their health care from a patchwork system of Indian Health Service facilities, tribally-operated clinics and urban Indian health centers, and vaccination efforts have varied from tribe to tribe and state to state.

But as states and counties struggled with disorganized rollouts, glitchy sign-up forms and long lines, many tribal nations and clinics were able to vaccinate their populations quickly.

The option to receive allotments from the Indian Health Service or from their state gave tribal health clinics more independence in distribution, and the autonomy to determine what groups should get priority helped tribes protect the most vulnerable members of their population. Existing robust health systems helped tribes reach their citizens more efficiently, while tailored messaging helped to build trust in the vaccine.",https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/16/us/oklahoma-tribes-offers-vaccine-to-all-trnd/index.html
Dolly Parton ‘humbly’ declines to have statue of herself outside Tennessee capitol: ‘I don’t think it’s appropriate’,Dolly Parton ‘humbly’ declines to have statue of herself outside Tennesse capitol,1.0,"Dolly Parton has declined to have a statue of herself built outside the Tennessee state capitol, saying that while she’s “humbled” by the idea, she doesn’t think it’s right at this time.

The musician released a statement on the issue on Thursday.

She began by thanking the Tennessee lawmakers who have supported the initiative. “I am honoured and humbled by their intention but I have asked the leaders of the state legislature to remove the bill from any and all consideration,” she added.

Parton explained her decision, adding: “Given all that is going on in the world, I don’t think putting me on a pedestal is appropriate at this time. I hope, though, that somewhere down the road several years from now or perhaps after I’m gone if you still feel I deserve it, then I’m certain I will stand proud in our great State Capitol as a grateful Tennessean.”

The singer pledged to “continue to try to do good work to make this great state proud”.

Parton is a native of Tennessee and – while becoming a global icon – has retained strong ties with the state. Her Dollywood theme park, located in Pigeon Forge, is one of its biggest tourist attractions.

In January this year, Democratic Representative John Mark Windle introduced a bill making the case for a statue recognising Parton “for all that she has contributed to this state”. According to the bill, the statue wouldn’t have been funded through tax dollars, but through private gifts, grants, and donations.

The artist has a long history of philanthropy, with initiatives dedicated to increasing child literacy or helping people who lost their homes in the Gatlinburg wildfires in 2016.

Recently, Parton made a million-dollar donation that helped the development of the Moderna coronavirus vaccine.

Dr Mark Denison of the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, who worked on the vaccine research, told The New York Times the donation was “critical” in funding early research efforts.

“Her money helped us develop the test that we used to first show that the Moderna vaccine was giving people a good immune response that might protect them,” he told the newspaper.

Last year, a new mural in Nashville, Tennessee, celebrated Parton’s support of Black Lives Matter. It consists of a portrait of a singer, along with the quote – coming from an interview Parton gave to Billboard : “Of course Black lives matter.

Dad posts 'Don't Give Up' signs around town to lower suicide rates: 'You never know who is struggling',Dad posts 'Don't Give Up' signs around town to lower suicide rates: 'You never know who is struggling',1.0,"Seattle father Colby Wallace is spreading encouragement through motivational signs.

After a cluster of local teen suicides, stay-at-home dad Colby Wallace launched the “You Matter” campaign to strengthen mental health.

On May 12th, Wallace, the 42-year-old father in Queen Anne, Seattle, heard about four teen suicides in King County. “These were local high school students and no one was really talking about it,” Wallace tells Yahoo Lifestyle.

A friend told Wallace about the Don’t Give Up Movement, started in 2017 by Amy Wolff, a mom in Newberg, Oregon who, affected by the suicide rates in her community, started distributing motivational signs. Now, she runs a non-profit that sells signs, wall decals, and wristbands with encouraging phrases.

It was smart, thought Wallace, so he called Wolfe and spent $105 on 15 signs: ‘You’re Worthy of Love,’ ‘Don’t Give Up,’ ‘You Matter,’ and ‘Your Mistakes Don’t Define You.’ He paid $30 for 200 branded wristbands.

“We placed signs across the street from my daughter’s school and an older woman told me, ‘Thank you so much because people my age really need to hear this,” Wallace tells Yahoo Lifestyle.

The gentle signs are non-intrusive reminders to keep going. “I’ve learned that you never know who is struggling,” he tells Yahoo Lifestyle. “Some people seem like they have it together but need to hear this.”

When his five- and nine-year-old daughters’ elementary school asked to feature the signs in its newsletters, naming them the “You Matter” campaign, people started helping Wallace with distribution. “A woman told me she was in tears after dropping off her daughter at school because the sign made her feel heard,” he says.

Wallace and his family placed the signs all around town, including one with “Don’t Give Up” on a steep hill for bicyclists in need of literal motivation.

But someone has been tearing down Wallace’s work, bending the metal stakes and stealing the signs altogether. “Maybe it’s someone who needs to hear these messages,” says Wallace.

Now, neighbors are donating money to Wallace for him to fund new orders and he’s already spent $400 on new supplies. The dad will post signs throughout the spring and continue again when school starts.

“I would love for someone to continue this work in other neighborhoods,” he tells Yahoo Lifestyle. “Really, anyone can do this.”

One woman’s race to defuse the genetic time bomb in her genes,"In 2011, Sonia Vallabh was handed a genetic report that contained a death sentence: she carried the gene for a prion disease, fatal familial insomnia. She quit her job, got a PhD and is now working with Ionis Pharma to develop a potential drug for her condition.",1.0,"In 2011, Sonia Vallabh was handed a genetic report that contained a death sentence. But it also held a map for how to escape.

Her body, she learned, harbored a gene mutation, a single wrong letter of DNA in her “prion” gene, that would eventually lead to a rare brain condition called fatal familial insomnia. Her mother had died of it the year before, and the test had revealed Vallabh had inherited the flaw too.

By now, the decision by Vallabh and her husband, Eric Minikel, to try to prevent her disease—“a prion love story,” the New Yorker called it—is well-known. After the diagnosis of the genetic time bomb, they dropped out of their careers in law and engineering and became scientists dedicated to defusing it. They expect to get PhDs next spring (see “Sonia Vallabh, 35 Innovators Under 35, 2016”.)

Now, after seven years, they think they have found a treatment that can do it. It’s called an antisense drug, a type of mirror-image molecule that, if it reaches the brain, could greatly reduce the amount of the prion protein. That could potentially forestall the mysterious chain reaction of misfolding proteins that characterize prion diseases.

Less of the protein, Vallabh reasons, and less chance she’ll get sick.

Two weeks ago, on their blog, Vallabh announced she and Minikel were working with a commercial partner, the California biotech company Ionis, which specializes in antisense compounds. “For the first time, I am optimistic about a specific therapeutic strategy,” she wrote. It’s “plausible” that antisense could treat the disease “in our lifetime.”

Vallabh’s race to prevent her own prion disease raises a question for the genetic age. Given a perfect DNA blueprint of your inherited disease, what’s your chance of stopping it in your lifetime, or that of someone you love?

There are reasons to think these types of medical long shots have become more likely to hit the mark. That is because gene sequencing can cheaply reveal molecular flaws, but also because a set of promising technologies—antisense, gene therapy, and CRISPR gene editing—are able to replace genes or silence them, in effect fixing genetic problems at their source.

What’s more, these treatments employ the genetic code; they are actually made of DNA or RNA. That means that they’re fundamentally modular and programmable. At least on paper, it is now possible to take any genetic flaw and quickly sketch an antidote.

In reality, drug development is notoriously complicated. Most drugs fail, torn down by biological surprises and unexpected toxicity to the human body. But Vallabh says in the early, confusing days of her quest, she received critical advice from Eric Lander, the biologist who leads the Broad Institute, where she and Minikel now study and work. He told her to focus on the genetic error itself—the blueprint of which was in her diagnosis.

“You need to see what you have in your hand and stop looking,” she recalls him saying.

That meant not waiting to answer important scientific unknowns, like what the prion protein does in the body, or why, when it misfolds, it kills brain cells. “There are so many interesting questions about prion disease,” says Vallabh, who is 34. “And those questions will still be there when we are treating it.”

Prion diseases are profoundly strange because they’re caused not by a virus, but by an infectious protein. They include scrapie in sheep, Kuru (spread by cannibalism), Creutzfelt-Jakob disease, and the human version of mad cow disease.

The key drug insight was that mice engineered to lack the prion protein gene never get sick, even when scientists inject infectious prions into their brains. “The biological concept of a prion is a protein that changes it conformation, and that can template further copies. It’s self-templating. That allows it to spread,” says Kurt Giles, a researcher in the lab at the University of California, San Francisco, where prions were first discovered. “That leads to the idea of reducing the [protein]. The less of it there is, then you will get less templating.”

For genetic therapies, though, there’s a further problem, which is how to get them into the body so that they reach, for instance, billions of brain cells.

Antisense technology, conceived decades ago, had its big breakthrough last year when a drug developed by Ionis proved to be astoundingly effective in treating a childhood neurological disorder, spinal muscular atrophy.

By then, Vallabh and Minikel had been introduced to Ionis, and the company had agreed to provide them with antisense compounds targeted to the prion gene to test in mice. Holly Kordasiewicz, the head of neuroscience at Ionis, recalls the 2014 meeting. “We left the room saying we need to do everything that we can to help these people,” she says.

The company gave Vallabh and Minikel a to-do list, which they quickly worked through. Patient registry? Check. Animal studies? Check. Biomarker to show if a drug is working? That research, too, is under way at a Boston hospital studying prion protein levels in spinal fluid.

“Sonia and Eric are doing this with no real funding, just trying to make it happen,” says Jeff Carroll, another patient scientist (he’s got the mutation for Huntington’s disease), who introduced them to Ionis.

One problem not as easily addressed is that prion disease is astoundingly rare, quickly fatal, and rarely diagnosed in advance. That means there has been no great clamor for treatments. Maybe only 200 people in the U.S. know they have a time bomb like Vallabh, she says, and there’s not a single drug currently in human testing. Early on, Ionis let the pair know the collaboration was strictly academic and not a commercial prospect.

But by blotting out the prion protein at its source, an antisense treatment might help with a range of rare conditions linked to it. Fatal insomnia is vanishingly uncommon, as are cases of mad cow disease, but adding these “ultra-rare” diseases together makes them, as a group, slightly less rare.

Vallabh and Minikel say they now have proof that Ionis’s antisense molecules partly protect mice from prion disease. Those animals given the drug live about 70 percent longer.

Kordasiewicz now terms the program a “commercial” project at Ionis, though it remains too small and early-stage to appear on the company’s pipeline chart of drugs under development. “What changed is the data is looking good enough that we think we can have a drug in five years,” she says.

Vallabh hopes it can all go even faster. The fatal insomnia could begin to afflict her tomorrow, or in 30 years. There’s no way to predict it. She and Minikel just had their first child. The girl was conceived through IVF, and Vallabh says the lab employed a genetic test to assure them she wouldn’t carry the mutation.

To save herself, it’s not going to be enough to have a drug. She needs to get it before she ever falls ill. Yet doctors have little experience giving such a genetic drug over many years as a form of prevention.

Figuring out how to carry off such a study is the next challenge for Vallabh and her husband. It appears they hope the US Food and Drug Administration will permit a prevention trial in patients who carry the prion mutations. Since it can take decades for people to get sick (or not), such a study would instead rely on a biomarker, such as whether antisense injections can reduce prion protein levels in the spinal fluid.

Vallabh told me she would volunteer to take the drug. “The big picture,” she says, “is we are moving much more quickly than anyone could expect due to this beautifully clear genetic blueprint we were handed.”",https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611672/one-womans-race-to-defuse-the-genetic-time-bomb-in-her-genes/?utm_campaign=social_button&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_content=2018-07-23
Say ‘goodbye’ to robocalls: The TRACED Act passes through U.S. House,Say ‘goodbye’ to robocalls: The TRACED Act passes through U.S. House,1.0,"WASHINGTON (KSNW) – There may soon be an end to those pesky robocalls. The U.S. House of Representatives has passed a bill making it harder for the calls to get through to you.

The Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence, or TRACED Act would push carriers to implement a caller authentification system and require companies to block the calls for free.

The vote passed in the House of Representatives with a nearly unanimous vote, 417-3. “The robocall issue is one issue, maybe the one issue, that’s united everybody, Republicans, and Democrats,” said Rep. David Kustoff, R-TN.

Rep. Frank Pallone, D-NJ said of the bills passing, “Today, the house is giving Americans back control of their phones.”

The bill is also expected to extend the time government regulators have to track phone scammers and more power to penalize them when found.

The TRACED Act is anticipated to be passed by the Senate in the coming weeks. President Trump could sign it into law before Christmas.

"LGBT workers are protected from workplace discrimination, Texas judge says in 'earth-shattering' new ruling","LGBT workers are protected from workplace discrimination, Texas judge says in 'earth-shattering' new ruling | LGBT | Dallas News",1.0,"AUSTIN — For the first time in Texas, a federal judge said LGBT workers should be protected from employment discrimination based on their gender identity and sexual orientation.

Judge Lee Rosenthal, the chief judge in the Houston-based Southern District Court of Texas, said in a decision last week that federal employment law protecting workers from discrimination based on sex also applies to sexual orientation and gender identity.

Nicole Wittmer, an engineer who alleged she wasn't hired by energy company Phillips 66 because she's transgender, couldn't prove her claim, Rosenthal ruled. But if she had proof, the judge added, Wittmer would have had cause to sue under federal law.

Rosenthal's ruling doesn't mean it's suddenly illegal in Texas to discriminate against LGBT workers. But it may be cited in the future by others who believe their sexual orientation or gender identity was a factor in workplace decisions, Wittmer's lawyer told The Dallas Morning News.

""We're certainly disappointed that this particular ruling did not fall in her favor,"" Alfonso Kennard Jr. said Monday. ""The silver lining here is it has helped to define the landscape for people who have been discriminated [against] in the workplace due to their transgender status.""

""This ruling is earth-shattering — in a good way.""

A growing trend

Federal judges in several other states have already decided that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender workers are also covered under Title VII, the civil rights era-law that prohibits sex discrimination in the workplace.

But there has never been such a decision by a federal court in Texas, Louisiana or Mississippi, the states covered by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Texas state law also doesn't prohibit employment discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, which means it's still legal for Texas employers to fire or fail to hire someone because they're LGBT.

Rosenthal, who was appointed in 1992 by President George H.W. Bush, said recent decisions in other jurisdictions helped shape her decision.

""Within the last year, several circuits have expanded Title VII protection to include discrimination based on transgender status and sexual orientation,"" Rosenthal wrote. ""Although the Fifth Circuit has not yet addressed the issue, these very recent circuit cases are persuasive. ... The court assumes that Wittmer's status as a transgender woman places her under the protections of Title VII.""

Harper Jean Tobin, policy director at the National Center for Transgender Equality, characterized the decision as part of a growing consensus that Title VII covers trans workers as well.

""This ruling, along with dozens of others, shows that discrimination against transgender workers is illegal under federal law,"" Tobin said in a prepared statement. ""This is the overwhelming approach of the courts across the country over the last decade.""

Dale Carpenter, a constitutional law and LGBT rights expert at Southern Methodist University, said the ruling was the first of its kind in Texas.

It goes beyond a 2008 case in which another federal judge in Texas said gender nonconforming persons could not be discriminated against in the workplace, he said, because this one also recognizes transgender status as a protected trait.

""It is significant,"" Carpenter said of Rosenthal's decision. Agreeing with Tobin, he called it ""part of a growing trend around the country.""

The decision could provide cover for other LGBT workers, Carpenter added, who are not protected for employment discrimination under state law. Someone could sue and cite this case, he said, and if they win at the 5th Circuit, it would create a new precedent for the entire region.

""Just based on the sheer population of Texas,"" Carpenter said, ""if it becomes the rule in Texas, this would be the single biggest victory against employment discrimination that has yet to be enjoyed by the LGBT rights movement.""",https://www.dallasnews.com/news/lgbt/2018/04/10/lgbt-workers-protected-workplace-discrimination-texas-judge-says-earth-shattering-new-ruling
"Old Navy, Target, and Warby Parker are paying employees to vote and work at the polls","Old Navy, Target, Warby Parker, and Compass Coffee are paying employees for time off to vote and work at the polls.",1.0,"On August 31, Civic Alliance announced that more than 60 of its “member companies” — which include Starbucks, Old Navy, Target, and Microsoft — will work to encourage employees and consumers to serve as poll workers. The organization set a recruitment goal of 350,000 poll workers, the projected number of staffers necessary to keep precincts up and running smoothly.

The 2020 election is less than two months away, and for months, voting rights organizations have sounded the alarm bells about the possibility of a poll worker shortage. Poll workers are the community members who greet voters at their local precinct, check their registration, and direct them to voting booths. According to Pew’s Stateline, these staffers’ presence could be “the difference between a smooth election and long lines, mass confusion, and miscounted ballots.” Anyone over 16 can sign up to work during Election Day and be compensated for their time. However, a majority of these crucial workers are usually senior citizens, who are likely to refrain from working at the polls out of concern for their health during a pandemic. Even prior to the coronavirus, however, nearly 70 percent of states and jurisdictions have struggled to recruit a sufficient number of staff.

The responsibility of poll worker recruitment should theoretically fall on local and state policymakers, but currently, corporations are jumping in to fill this gap and partnering with bipartisan voter organizations, like Civic Alliance and Power to the Polls, to address the shortage.

Old Navy, a subsidiary of Gap, Inc., announced on September 1 that its employees would receive a day’s worth of pay if they signed up to work at the polls. Target, Warby Parker, and DC-based coffee chain Compass Coffee will also give workers paid time off to serve as election workers. On top of these efforts, high-profile companies like Starbucks, Twitter, PayPal, Walmart, and Uber have said they plan to give workers time off to vote. Some are offering workers as little as three hours of paid leave while others are giving employees Election Day off.

Poll workers are needed now more than ever. We’re proud to offer paid time off to our team volunteering on Election Day, and we want YOU to join us. By volunteering you are making a real and meaningful difference in our democracy. Check out @PowerThePolls for more info! pic.twitter.com/HsJCtmnvow — Compass Coffee (@CompassCoffeeDC) September 1, 2020

Heather Marshall, a café manager at Compass, told Vox that in previous years, she had voted via absentee ballot, and that the thought of serving as a poll worker hadn’t really crossed her mind when she was a college student. “Given the pandemic, I wasn’t sure what this year would look like in terms of in-person voting,” she wrote via email. “So when [Compass employees] were approached with the idea [to be poll workers], I knew it was something for which I needed to volunteer my time. I want to be any part of the effort to ensure a free, fair, and Covid-19 safe election.”

This push from employers like Compass to staff up the polls is the latest move by corporate America to encourage civic participation, as companies take on a “pro-democracy and pro-voter” stance without fear of alienating the political views of any given customer or employee. In 2018, Bloomberg reported that a record 44 percent of US firms committed to giving workers paid time off to vote in the midterm elections; this was an increase of 7 percentage points from the 2016 election, according to the Society for Human Resources Management. For the 2018 midterms, the outdoor apparel company Patagonia launched a campaign called Time to Vote and enlisted 411 companies that represent over 2 million workers. In addition to staffing up election sites this year, companies are also donating personal protective equipment, disseminating information about how to vote, and even offering up building space, the director of Civic Alliance told the Wall Street Journal.

American consumers and workers increasingly expect corporations to take stances, or at the very least engage on political and social issues. A 2019 case study by the Harvard Kennedy School found that consumers are more likely to buy from companies that have encouraged people to participate in the democratic process. The companies analyzed in the study, which included Snapchat, Spotify, Patagonia, Target, and Gap, had a range of voter engagement programs — from internal efforts directed at employees to public campaigns that sought to reach millions of people.

“What’s interesting is that more and more companies are making their voting policies public, which shifts the burden of knowledge away from the individual,” said Philip Chen, an assistant professor of political science at Beloit College. “Before this, if you didn’t have the civic knowledge or engagement to figure out that you are legally allowed to have three unpaid or paid hours to go vote, you probably weren’t going to vote.”

Employee voting policies, though, fluctuate depending on the company: Patagonia will shut down all of its operations on Election Day (as it did in 2016 and 2018), while Walmart will grant its employees three hours off if the hours of their shift prevent them from voting. In some cases, workers will have to give their supervisor a day’s notice about their need to leave to vote, since managers are creating “voting plans” to ensure that shifts remain staffed on Election Day.

“What’s interesting is that more and more companies are making their voting policies public, which shifts the burden of knowledge away from the individual”

These corporate-driven voter initiatives are a positive development, considering how companies decades ago remained mum on the issue. However, the growing involvement of employers — and the reliance on companies to staff polls and increase turnout — is emblematic of the US being “an outlier in established democracies,” Chen said. The US’s voter turnout rate is behind that of other established democracies: In the 2016 presidential election, the Census Bureau reported that only 61 percent of the voting-age population cast a ballot. That’s low compared to countries like Belgium (87 percent turnout) and Sweden (82 percent); America ranks 26th out of 32 developed democracies when it comes to voter participation.

Voting is not compulsory in the United States, nor is voter registration automatic or simple. Plus, there isn’t a federal holiday for citizens to take time off from work to vote. (Thanks to a federal law passed by Congress in the 19th century, Election Day always falls on a Tuesday in November.) This is unlike what other democracies have: Countries like Austria, Australia, Luxembourg, and Singapore mandate attendance at the polls, while others like France, Israel, and South Korea vote on weekends or have instituted federal holidays to encourage turnout. In the US, however, each state has established its own voting laws.

“The short answer is, these laws are entirely dependent on the state,” Chen told Vox. “Some states require paid time off, while others have universal vote-by-mail. Some have no requirements and simply encourage employers to allow their workers to vote. Most states, though, have something in the middle where workers have to meet a set of criteria to take off time to vote.”

In 13 states, Election Day is a paid holiday for state employees, although workers might only get a few hours of leave. Meanwhile, in places like Oregon and Washington, residents have ballots mailed out to them, so voting is a task primarily completed at home. With more companies actively encouraging their employees to vote and serve as poll workers, that could likely contribute to an improvement in turnout.

Yet it’s difficult to predict how the coronavirus pandemic and the Postal Service slowdown will affect the 2020 election and voter participation. During the primaries earlier this year, the Washington Post reported that some half a million mail-in ballots were rejected as a result of late delivery or voter error. Plus, as Recode’s Adam Clark Estes reported, mail service has recently been disrupted nationwide due to Covid-19 and a series of cost-cutting policies instituted by its new postmaster general, Louis DeJoy. Voting rights advocates and politicians are encouraging citizens to make a plan and vote early, and tech companies like Snapchat and Facebook are rolling out “voter checklist” features for users to easily register.

Companies are trying to reduce institutional barriers to voting, but political scientists aren’t exactly certain how having a federal voting holiday or automatic registration would increase turnout, Chen added. “These barriers absolutely have an effect, but it’s hard to figure out the exact effect.” What these corporations are looking to do is “trying to approximate the system we see in other established democracies,” he said. “They’re trying to replicate what we see with paid election holidays, which certainly helps with informing people, and it also looks good from a corporate standpoint.”",https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/9/10/21428934/companies-pay-employees-poll-workers-2020
China’s vow to shut down its ivory trade by the end of 2017 is a ‘game changer’ for elephants,China’s vow to shut down its ivory trade by the end of 2017 is a ‘game changer’ for elephants,1.0,"An assistant arranges a carved ivory tusk in the window of a Hong Kong store in October 2015. (Simon Denyer/The Washington Post)

China promised Friday to halt its domestic ivory trade completely by the end of 2017, a decision greeted by environmentalists as offering real hope for an end to a poaching crisis that is wiping out tens of thousands of elephants across Africa.

“China’s announcement is a game changer for elephant conservation,” Carter Roberts, president of the World Wildlife Fund, said in a statement. “The large-scale trade of ivory now faces its twilight years, and the future is brighter for wild elephants.”

China said it would begin phasing out the ivory trade in March and cease processing and trading completely by Dec. 31, 2017.

The Natural Resources Defense Council, a New York-based environmental advocacy group, said the news “may be the biggest sign of hope for elephants since the current poaching crisis began,” while Grace Ge Gabriel, Asia director at the International Fund for Animal Welfare, said she was “overwhelmed with joy.”

“This is great news that will shut down the world’s largest market for elephant ivory,” said Aili Kang, Asia director at the Wildlife Conservation Society. “Ivory traffickers have just lost one of their biggest markets.”

It is a huge step for a country that had previously argued that ivory carving was part of its cultural heritage and where intricately carved ivory items had become popular gifts to grease the wheels of government and business.

The government was moved not just by international pressure but also by changing attitudes among ordinary Chinese. Celebrities such as former NBA star Yao Ming have led campaigns to “stop the buying” of ivory — and simply to educate people that elephants had to die for the ivory to be taken.

There was also a realization that China’s key role in the illicit ivory trade was damaging its image in Africa.

After the market is shuttered, the Chinese Ministry of Culture will help ivory sector employees find other jobs, for example, encouraging “master carvers” to work in museums to help repair and maintain significant ivory works of art, the statement said. The government also pledged to ramp up law enforcement, and educate the public to reject ivory.

Peter Knights, chief executive of WildAid, a San Francisco-based group at the forefront of efforts to change Chinese attitudes toward the ivory trade, called it the “best possible news for Africa’s elephants” and congratulated President Xi Jinping for his leadership on the issue.

Although poaching may have peaked a few years ago, some 20,000 African elephants continue to be killed for their tusks every year, experts say, largely to meet demand from Asia, and particularly China, for ivory.

Africa’s elephant population has dwindled from about 1.2 million 35 years ago to between 400,000 and 500,000 now. Central African forest elephants could be extinct within the next decade if current trends continue, while Tanzania’s elephant population fell by 60 percent between 2009 and 2014, census data showed.

The global trade, thought to be worth around $10 billion annually, is run by international criminal syndicates, sometimes with help from African rebel groups.

But even if a ban is enforced in China, some experts warn that the trade could shift across the border into neighboring Laos, Vietnam and Burma, where large markets flourish selling endangered wildlife products to Chinese consumers. There is also a danger of traders passing off elephant ivory as legal mammoth ivory.

Still, a clear signal from the Chinese government is seen as going a long way toward making ivory as unfashionable here as it is in the West.

China retains a small stock of legal ivory purchased in 2008, when international trade in it was allowed. The state has been gradually supplying that ivory to carving workshops and selling it domestically. But this legal business, experts say, has provided cover for a vast underground trade network.

The announcement follows a pledge by Xi and President Obama in September 2015 to end the domestic trade in ivory in their respective countries. Hong Kong, another major hub for ivory smuggling, announced last week that it would raise maximum penalties for wildlife crime to 10 years and phase out its own trade in ivory by the end of 2021 — although pressure may now mount for it to move more quickly.

In January 2014, China signaled how official attitudes were changing by staging a ceremony to crush six tons of tusks and carved ivory ornaments that had been seized in anti-trafficking operations.

The United States has largely closed down its own ivory market by banning trade at the federal level and in several states, but experts said it still needs to do more in terms of enforcement.

The last bastion of the trade is now Japan, said Knights, of WildAid. He urged global opponents of the trade to shift their attention there.

First Trial of Moderna's Coronavirus Vaccine Produces Immune Response in All Participants,First Trial of Moderna's Coronavirus Vaccine Produces Immune Response in All Participants,1.0,"Results from the Phase 1 trial of Cambridge, Massachusetts biotech firm Moderna's coronavirus vaccine show it is safe and produces an immune response.

The preliminary report of the trial, published in The New England Journal of Medicine Tuesday, reveals that all 45 participants developed so-called neutralizing antibodies that bind to the virus and stop it from attacking other cells. They developed these antibodies at levels comparable to the upper half of COVID-19 survivors. ""The good news is that this vaccine induced antibodies,"" director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Anthony Fauci told Bloomberg News. ""Not just any kind of antibodies, but neutralizing antibodies.""

Public health experts agree that a vaccine is necessary to return life to normal in the wake of a pandemic that has infected millions and killed almost 575,000, according to Reuters. More than one vaccine will probably be required, because it will be difficult for any one company to produce the billions of doses needed, The New York Times pointed out. ""None of us are safe unless all of us are safe,"" Columbia University virologist Dr. Angela Rasmussen told The New York Times. ""It's not just us. It's everybody in the world."" The Moderna vaccine candidate was the first to be tested on human subjects, and Tuesday's published paper confirms the positive results reported by the company in May.

In the trial, 45 people aged 18 to 55 received two doses of the vaccine 28 days apart, according to Reuters. They received doses of either 25, 100 or 250 micrograms. More than half of the people who received the middle dose experienced side effects like fatigue, chills, headache and muscle pain and 40 percent of them developed a fever after the second dose, according to Bloomberg. Three of the 14 people who received the highest dose suffered severe side effects, but the company has decided to stop testing that dose. Fauci said the side-effects were normal and not a cause for concern, but other experts disagreed. ""Man, that is a lot of adverse events,"" Tony Moody, a doctor and researcher at the Duke Human Vaccine Institute, told Bloomberg. However, Moody also said the amount of antibodies produced was ""really encouraging.""",https://www.ecowatch.com/coronavirus-vaccine-moderna-antibodies-2646411488.html
"After 3 Years Under ISIS, Mosul's Children Go Back To School","After 3 Years Under ISIS, Mosul's Children Finally Go Back To School",1.0,"After 3 Years Under ISIS, Mosul's Children Go Back To School

Enlarge this image toggle caption Jane Arraf/NPR Jane Arraf/NPR

The recess bell rings at the Akha elementary school in Mosul and children come thundering out of the classroom. It's the first day of school.

An ordinary scene, except it hasn't happened for three years in this city. Iraqi forces drove ISIS fighters out of Mosul earlier this year in a battle that destroyed huge parts of the northern city, including hundreds of schools.

""None of us went to school when ISIS was here — we stayed at home,"" says Ali, who is in sixth grade. ""It feels good to be back.""

ISIS sent government teachers home and ran its own schools — focused on religion and weapons training. Even basic math had a militaristic twist, using the image of bullets to teach children to count.

To make up for the lost years, the Iraqi government implemented a system where children could take makeup classes and then sit for exams. If they passed, they moved into the grades they would have been in if school hadn't been interrupted. Junior high and high school students were still sitting for exams while the elementary schools reopened at the beginning of October.

'We want to free the children's minds'

Iraq is struggling with the aftermath of ISIS, which took over huge swaths of territory when it came in in 2014. There is a shortage of almost everything in the schools.

In the classrooms, boys with scrubbed faces and clip-on ties sit at battered desks. Little girls wearing new shoes and jeweled headbands and ribbons in their hair line up against dirty walls covered in graffiti.

""This is our library,"" art teacher Ahmed Abdul Aziz al-Jabouri says proudly. He points to an old bookshelf with a few dozen cartoon paperbacks. He says the teachers donated whatever books they had at home.

""In the future,"" he says, ""we are going to ask students' families to bring books so this small library will grow.""

Jabouri says each student has been asked to bring a flower to plant in the dirt yard at the school entrance. Decorative fountains made of painted clay pots and homemade benches line what teachers hope will be a flourishing flower garden.

""Three years out of school is a long time, so it has affected their minds with all the pressure and the bad treatment. We want to free the children's minds from all those bad thoughts,"" Jabouri says.

'Beginning from zero'

The battle by U.S.-backed Iraqi troops to drive ISIS out of Mosul destroyed most of the schools on the west side of the city and damaged others on the east.

At the education ministry, parents crowd into hallways with charred, blackened walls and wires hanging from the ceiling. Thousands of families who lost birth certificates and other documents when they fled the city are still trying to register their children in school.

Even in towns that suffered relatively little damage, some schools haven't managed to open yet.

Samira Abdul Satar, the principal of a girls' school in the town of Bartella, was sitting in the director of education's office on the day when classes at her school should have started.

""We don't have running water,"" she says. ""It's a big school and there are no cleaners. We need the municipality or someone else to come and clean it, at least, and to bring desks to begin with.""

Ministry officials in the Ninevah school district said they didn't have approval to be quoted. But unofficially, one said: ""We are beginning from zero. We don't have books, we don't have pencils, we don't have anything.""

In one girls' school in east Mosul where classes had started, half of a hallway wall had been blasted out by a rocket-propelled grenade. A classroom next to it was still in ruins.

A caretaker at the school said two or three ISIS teachers had taught a few dozen children from ISIS families there. Because the ISIS interpretation of Islam forbids depicting human or animal figures, the group defaced cartoon characters that had been painted on the walls. On one wall, a black smear of paint obscured the features of SpongeBob SquarePants. On another, the faces of elves and Aladdin were painted over.

'We want you to succeed'

At the Akha elementary school, Principal Yassar Ghanam Shaker lines up the children in the courtyard. In many parts of Iraq, because of overcrowding, students go to school just four hours a day. The boys are the afternoon shift on this day, with a few girls interspersed. Wearing new-looking dresses and their hair held back with white headbands, they primly hold little purses.

""Make sure you're on time,"" Shaker tells them sternly. ""I don't want any absences. We want you to succeed. ""

ISIS used this school as a military base, firing rocket-propelled grenades and mortars at nearby Iraqi forces. During the summer, teachers donated paint and came in on their own time to cover the shrapnel holes with cheerful scenes of Mosul.

One of the shiny new murals depicts the centuries-old leaning minaret, al-Hadba, a quirky and beloved symbol of Mosul. ISIS blew up the minaret and the mosque next to it as its forces retreated.

Shaker, who describes himself as ""100 percent from Mosul"" pauses and chokes up a bit when asked about the lost monument.

""Of course it's historic, but Mosul isn't about monuments,"" he says. ""If al-Hadba falls, God willing we won't fall. If our monuments fall, we will still be here.""",http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2017/10/09/556532909/after-3-years-under-isis-mosuls-children-go-back-to-school

Bonnie Kimball was fired on March 28 by Fresh Picks, which supplied food the Mascoma Valley Regional High School in Manchester, New Hampshire, after telling a student ""tell (your) mom you need money"" but giving the student lunch anyway, according to CBS Boston.

Kimball explained to The Associated Press why she gave the student a pass. ""His family is very well known in this town and I can guarantee that if I called his mother, she would have come right in and paid the bill. But I didn't want to get her out of work.

Kimball hasn't heard of any job offer from the company and expressed no desire to get it back, she told CBS Boston.

In a prepared statement, the school district said any student who could not afford a lunch would be with meals, milk, fruits and vegetables.

Kimball's story has gone viral, and even celebrity chef José Andrés took to Twitter to offer Kimball employment at his nonprofit World Central Kitchen. ""The hero is Bonnie Kimball! If she needs a new job we have openings @thinkfoodgroup,"" Andrés tweeted.

Taco Bell extends education benefits to all employees

WLNS) – If you’re looking for a way to improve your education, a job at Taco Bell could be the answer.

Taco Bell announced on Monday that it is partnering with Guild Education to provide education support for all 210,000 team members in its system of 7,000 restaurants in the U.S.

The company says a pilot of the program resulted in a 34 percent increase in retention for those enrolled over the first six months, supporting Taco Bell’s growth and hiring plans over the next five years.

Taco Bell team members will have access to personalized college advisors and tuition discounts for thousands of classes, certificates, and degrees.

“When we surveyed our employees, education support was one of the top three things they asked for,” said Frank Tucker, Global Chief People Officer at Taco Bell.

“The barriers to achieving their education goals were time, money and support. Our partnership with Guild delivers on all of these needs for our employees through access to online classes, financial aid guidance, tuition assistance and a personal counselor to support each student in real time.”

All Taco Bell corporate and franchise employees will have access to Guild’s academic and financial aid coaches and discounts to Guild’s education partners – a network of 80 online non-profit universities and learning providers, offering Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees, programs such as high school completion and English-as-a-second-language and a wide selection of certificates.

Taco Bell corporate employees, along with employees of participating franchises, will also have access to up to $5,250 per calendar year in tuition assistance including books and supplies, paid up front so that employees don’t have any out-of-pocket costs.

Herfel had been feeling pain in the area, but an emergency room doctor said it was an ovarian cyst and gave her pain medication.

Man drops 326 pounds after needing two plane seats in evacuation from Fort McMurray fire,Man drops 326 pounds after needing two plane seats in evacuation from Fort McMurray fire,1.0,"His weight got in the way of someone escaping the Fort McMurray wildfire and Tony Bussey, 43, vowed that would never happen again.

He dropped 326 pounds.

In May 2016, everyone thought the worst of the Fort McMurray fire was behind them and they were out of its reach.​

Bussey, pictured in 2010 with his daughter, Emma, says he hopes his lifestyle change will inspire others. (Submitted)

Workers, including Bussey, a heavy equipment tire changer, had been sent back to camp and things were moving forward, when, unexpectedly, the fire picked up again.

Planes were brought in to evacuate the site.

""The fire, for all the destruction, and for all the hell that it caused … it saved my life,"" Bussey said.

Two seats to carry his weight

When he arrived at the airport, staff shuffled him to the front of the line because of his weight. It was attention he hated but was becoming used to.

Seeing people having to wait because I was too fat to sit next to, that was it for me. - Tony Bussey

At that point, Bussey weighed 567 pounds. He struggled to put on his socks. He wore size 66 pants.

And he needed two seats on an airplane.

""Seeing people having to wait because I was too fat to sit next to, that was it for me,"" he said.

""It was like, 'I've got to do something about this.'""

Bussey fits in just one of the legs of pants he wore two years ago. (Submitted)

He had already escaped the fire once, driving to Edmonton by himself days prior.

But it was this moment — physically taking up two seats and preventing someone else from getting to safety — that changed things.

""I kept thinking, 'Here it is: somebody's wife, somebody's husband, somebody's family member is waiting for their mom or dad or their loved one to come home, and their loved ones have to wait longer now because I'm too fat to sit next to.'

""That had a profound effect on me.""

'No surgery, no anything'

He reached Edmonton. And that's when he started his quest to lose weight.

""Three-hundred and twenty-six pounds gone. All naturally. No surgery, no anything. Just watching what I eat and walking,"" he said.

""I basically went on a low-carb, high protein diet.""

Bussey hopes to run a marathon on the fifth anniversary of the fire. (Submitted)

Even during the evacuation, when he was living out of a hotel room and eating out was his only option, he made the effort.

He took the skin off his chicken and ordered veggies instead of fries. He started walking, gradually increasing his exercise time — first five minutes, then 10.

""Two years ago, I could barely walk to my car,"" Bussey said. ""I could barely fit in my car.""

'There is hope'

He's down to 241 pounds now, having lost more than half his own body weight.

He just bought a pair of size 34 jeans.

It was almost as if you were just waiting to die. - Tony Bussey

Doctors say Bussey, because of the weight loss, has about 20 to 30 pounds of excess skin, which he plans to have removed.

""And then after that, I want to start in the gym,"" he said.

His next goal is to run a marathon. He wants to do it in three years, on the fifth anniversary of the fire.

And he wants to travel. He moved away from St. Lunaire-Griquet on Newfoundland's Northern Peninsula when he was 18. He hasn't gotten home much since because his size made travelling uncomfortable.

Bussey plans to travel more now that it will be more comfortable to do so. (Submitted)

Bussey wants his story to inspire others struggling with their weight.

""You used to think there was no hope. That it was just total despair that you were that big. That there was no going back. It was almost as if you were just waiting to die, as sad as that sounds, but that's all your life was.""

Giant panda no longer Endangered,Giant panda no longer Endangered,1.0,"In a welcome piece of good news for the world’s threatened wildlife, the giant panda has just been downgraded from ‘Endangered’ to ‘Vulnerable’ on the global list of species at risk of extinction, demonstrating how an integrated approach can help save our planet’s vanishing biodiversity.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) announced the positive change to the giant panda’s official status in the Red List of Threatened Species, pointing to the 17% rise in the population in the decade up to 2014, when a nationwide census found 1,864 giant pandas in the wild in China.

“For over 50 years, the giant panda has been the globe’s most beloved conservation icon as well as the symbol of WWF. Knowing that the panda is now a step further from extinction is an exciting moment for everyone committed to conserving the world’s wildlife and their habitats,” said Marco Lambertini, WWF Director General.

“The recovery of the panda shows that when science, political will and engagement of local communities come together, we can save wildlife and also improve biodiversity,” added Lambertini.

While the panda’s status has improved, other species are under increasing threat, including the Eastern gorilla that is now listed as critically endangered, just one step away from extinction, due primarily to poaching.

WWF’s panda logo was designed by the organisation’s founding chairman, the naturalist and painter Sir Peter Scott in 1961. Twenty years later, WWF became the first international organisation to work in China.

Ever since, WWF has been working with the government on initiatives to save giant pandas and their habitat, including helping to establish an integrated network of giant panda reserves and wildlife corridors to connect isolated panda populations as well as working with local communities to develop sustainable livelihoods and minimise their impact on the forests.

These efforts have seen the number of panda reserves jump to 67, which now protect nearly two-thirds of all wild pandas. They have also helped to safeguard large swathes of mountainous bamboo forests, which shelter countless other species and provide natural services to vast numbers of people, including tens of millions who live alongside rivers downstream of panda habitat.",http://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/giant-panda-no-longer-endangered
"YouTubers, Silicon Valley, and fans help MrBeast raise $20 million for tree charity",Teamtrees officially pass the goal of 20 million dollars.,1.0,"YouTubers have surpassed their goal of raising $20 million to help the Arbor Day Foundation plant 20 million trees, with the help of more than half a million donors and some wealthy tech executives. The charity campaign began nearly two months ago, when hundreds of YouTubers, led by Jimmy “MrBeast” Donaldson, teamed up to fight climate change and prove that YouTube “isn’t just a drama fest.”

Donaldson partnered with some of YouTube’s most popular creators to promote the “Team Trees” initiative, including Mark Rober (8.7M subscribers), Guava Juice (14.6M), Marques Brownlee (9.5M), Smarter Every Day (7.4M), Ninja (22.4M), Jacksepticeye (22.9M), and more. More channels participated after Donaldson and friends announced their plans on October 25th.

Through organizers’ videos and charity streams, the initiative quickly found its way to the halfway mark. By October 31st, more than $10 million had been raised, with donations coming in from some friends in very high places. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk donated $1 million, which was beat by Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke, who donated $1,000,001. Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey seemed to make two donations, one for $150,000 and another for $200,000 (representatives for Square and Twitter declined to comment). Naturally, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki also donated — she gave $200,000 to the campaign and made a video with Rober highlighting the cause.

Raising this much so quickly makes Team Trees one of the fastest-growing environmental fundraising initiatives, according to a representative for the Arbor Day Foundation. Trees planted as part of the fundraised will absorb and store 1.6 million tons of carbon, according to the representative. They’ll also help to remove 115,000 tons of chemical air pollution.

By October 31st, more than $10 million had been raised

Team Trees used social media sites like Twitter and even a spot on Jimmy Kimmel to spread awareness outside of YouTube, but they made concerted efforts to ensure news about the initiative spread on YouTube itself. Flooding YouTube with videos about Team Trees on the initiative’s launch day was meant to game the algorithm to promote their content on the homepage. Ensuring that each video was tagged as being about climate change and a charity initiative could have also helped videos reach more viewers.

The fundraiser was built around a joke started by Donaldson’s fans, who suggested he celebrate passing 20 million subscribers by planting 20 million trees. The joke turned into a charity drive — but it’s also been great for YouTubers’ channels. Donaldson’s own video on the initiative saw more than 35 million views, while other creators also saw tens of millions of views on their videos about the fundraiser. It’s one of the more positive moments on YouTube, and a sign of what creators can do when they work together for a good cause.

“We want to show that YouTube isn’t just a drama fest,” Donaldson said in a private video for YouTubers ahead of the campaign launch, as seen by The Verge. “We actually have real influence and can make real change.”

“We want to show that YouTube isn’t just a drama fest”

Trees will start to be planted in January 2020, according to an FAQ for the project. The goal is to have all 20 million trees planted “no later than December 2022.” Although the Arbor Day Foundation operates both within the United States and internationally, many of the trees will be planted in national parks around the US.

Of course, just because the $20 million milestone has been reached, it doesn’t mean donations have to stop.

A Kentucky Republican With a Gay Son Wants to Ban Conversion Therapy,"A Kentucky Republican With a Gay Son Wants to Ban Conversion Therapy | Alice Forgy Kerr, taking a position rare in her party, was moved by seeing the film Boy Erased.",1.0,"A bill to ban the use of conversion therapy on minors in Kentucky is coming from a surprising source.

The lead sponsor of the measure is a conservative Christian Republican, Sen. Alice Forgy Kerr of Lexington, who has a gay son and says the horrors of the practice were driven home when she saw the movie Boy Erased.

“I think it’s religion gone bad,” Kerr said of conversion therapy in a recent interview with Louisville TV station WHAS.

Being gay “can’t be fixed and it shouldn’t be fixed,” she said. “In my Christian faith, I am taught that we are all fearfully and wonderfully made, wonderfully made, and I believe that very strongly.” She has two sons, age 33 and 31; the younger one is gay.

“We’ve got to understand that, wherever we come down on the issue of homosexuality, this bill is about banning conversion torture,” she added.

Kerr introduced her legislation, Senate Bill 85, this month with cosponsors Sen. Julie Raque Adams, a Republican, and Sen. Morgan McGarvey, a Democrat. It would bar mental health professionals from performing conversion therapy, designed to turn LGBTQ people straight or cisgender, on people under 18, or on adults who have a “mental or physical dysfunction” that prevents them from managing their own affairs. Those who violate the law would be subject to discipline, and the legislation would also keep public funds from going to conversion therapy.

In a speech introducing the bill, Kerr said such therapy is based on the “false premise that being LGBTQ is a mental illness,” The Courier-Journal of Louisville reports. She called conversion therapy “discredited” (as it is, by every major medical and mental health organization) and “barbaric,” and noted that it is linked to higher rates of suicide. She urged anyone wanting more information about the practice to see Boy Erased.

The 2018 film, based on Garrard Conley’s memoir, is about a gay youth sent to conversion therapy by his conservative Baptist parents (his father is a minister). It portrays such therapy as horrific and abusive.

Nineteen states and the District of Columbia have banned the use of conversion therapy on minors by licensed professionals, as have numerous cities and counties. Kerr acknowledged her bill may have an uphill battle, as both the House and Senate have Republican majorities, and she is one of the few Republicans to support such legislation. But she’s willing to be patient, and she sees an opportunity to educate members of her party.

“We can keep working this,” she told WHAS. “A friend of mine once said that instant coffee ruined the world. You have to let things percolate.”",https://www.advocate.com/politics/2020/1/30/kentucky-republican-gay-son-wants-ban-conversion-therapy
"Republic of Congo names new national park, home to gorillas, elephants","The Republic of Congo has officially created its fifth national park, lending protection to great apes, forest elephants and other threatened wildlife.",1.0,"The new Ogooué-Leketi National Park is the Republic of Congo’s fifth national park.

It borders Batéké Plateau National Park in neighboring Gabon, and together the two parks form a transboundary protected area covering more than 5,500 square kilometers (2,120 square miles).

The official designation of Ogooué-Leketi National Park comes after three logging concessions that overlapped with the proposed park area were finally closed down.

All of the rights-holding communities that live close to the Ogooué-Leketi National Park were involved in the process of creating the protected area, according to the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Congo program.

The Republic of Congo has officially created its fifth national park, lending protection to great apes, forest elephants and other threatened wildlife.

The new Ogooué-Leketi National Park spans 3,500 square kilometers (1,350 square miles), and borders Batéké Plateau National Park in neighboring Gabon. Together, the two national parks form a transboundary protected area covering more than 5,500 square kilometers (2,120 square miles).

Ogooué-Leketi is also part of the Batéké Plateau landscape, a unique patchwork of large rolling savannas on sandy hills, interrupted by long strips of dense forests and turquoise-blue river valleys. This savanna-forest complex is home to several threatened species, some found nowhere else in Congo, according to a press release from the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Congo program, which has been surveying the area with the country’s Ministry of Forestry Economy since 2004.

In 2009, the IUCN identified the region in which the park sits today as a priority conservation site for the protection of the critically endangered western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and the endangered central chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes troglodytes), said Mark Gately, country director for WCS-Congo.

The forest sector of the new park is also home to several other species, such as the African forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis), forest buffalo (Syncerus caffer nanus), red river hog (Potamochoerus porcus), and several species of monkey including the iconic mandrill (Mandrillus sphinx). The savanna part of the national park, too, hosts a wide range of wildlife. The park has at least six species of rare savanna plants that are specialists of the Kalahari Sands, the substrate that forms the Batéké Plateau, and other savanna specialists like the bush duiker (Sylvicapra grimmia), side-striped jackal (Canis adustus), and several species of birds. The national park area was in fact identified by BirdLife International as a site of high importance for bird conservation in 2007.

The official designation of Ogooué-Leketi National Park comes after three logging concessions that overlapped with the proposed park area were finally closed down. Logging activity had expanded into the proposed protected area since 2013, Gately said, with loggers searching mainly for okoumé trees (Aucoumea klaineana) for use in plywood. All three logging companies, which are still active around the periphery of the park, completed logging within parts of the concessions overlapping the park in December 2016.

“With the support of the Congolese Minister of Forestry Economy, Mrs. Rosalie Matondo, the creation of the park has eliminated logging activity within the protected area boundaries, securing the closed canopy forest habitat that covers roughly a third of the park,” Gately said.

The roads and bridges that the logging companies built into the proposed park area have, however, facilitated commercial bushmeat hunting. Such hunting “is currently the biggest threat to the area’s wildlife and this trade links to cities like Pointe Noire and Brazzaville but also across [the] border towards Gabon,” Gately said.

“Great ape numbers have declined significantly in the area since 2010 and elephants, even if their population seems stable, recently started changing their behaviour — visiting forest clearings more at night than during the day, behaviour that is generally observed in elephant populations that perceive threats from humans in their habitat,” Gately added.

With the logging companies out, the government and WCS-Congo are now working with local communities to draw up a management plan for the national park. While no villages existed inside the area now designated as Ogooué-Leketi National Park, there are five villages very close to the park boundary. The residents of these villages have traditionally used the national park area for their needs, and continue to depend on the forest for their sustenance.

All of the rights-holding communities living near the national park were involved in the process of creating the protected area since the project was launched, Gately said. The boundaries of the protected area were mapped to ensure the villages weren’t incorporated into the national park. The communities also helped identify and map areas of cultural and traditional importance to them.

“The participatory mapping process led the government to … highlight any cultural or natural resource use zones that overlap with critical high ecological value areas, including bais [swampy, mineral-rich meadows], that will be integrated into the park under eco-development zones,” Gately said. “In these identified areas, which will be integrated into the management plan of the park, rights-holding communities will be able to continue traditional and subsistence-based gathering, fishing or hunting. The maps including the limit of the future park and the eco-development zones were validated for each village in order to ensure full consent.”

"Churchill: Fired for confronting racism, Maurice Rucker lands on his feet","Charles Rucker, the Home Depot employee fired for confronting a racist customer last year, has a new job helping parolees find jobs ""I'm Happy Here.""",1.0,"Albany

Nothing I wrote last year generated as much attention, or anger, as the columns about what happened to Maurice Rucker.

Rucker was an employee at the Home Depot on Central Avenue. On a day in July, he encountered an unpleasant (to put it mildly) customer, who was standing in Rucker's line in the Albany store's garden center.

I hate to repeat it all again, but the man called Rucker slow, said he owed his job to Donald Trump and hit him with an additional string of ugly insults.

""You're from the ghetto,"" the man said, who was white.

Rucker, who is black, eventually left his booth, got in the man's face and told him to leave the store. Five days later, Rucker was fired.

If I'm remembering correctly, I heard about Rucker's experience from an acquaintance of his. I initially figured there had to be more to the story, but there wasn't. A Home Depot spokesman at corporate headquarters said the company was appalled by the customer's behavior but defended the firing because Rucker had violated protocol.

Rucker had worked for Home Depot for 10 years.

""Firing a man for defending himself seems unfair,"" Rucker told me then. ""I'm a black man, and I have dealt with all levels of racism all my life. I am not going to accept racist behavior at work, home, the streets or anyplace else.""

Many of you agreed that Rucker had been poorly treated. In fact, the story just about exploded on the internet, with Rucker receiving messages of support from around the world.

Home Depot backtracked and offered Rucker his job back. He declined to return.

Rucker, a visual artist and lead singer for the country-rock-soul band Mozz, was widely known before the column ran. Everyone who I spoke to described him as a gentleman — and a gentle giant. (He's a big guy.) Nobody believed he deserved to be fired.

After the column ran, I heard from a frequent Home Depot customer who purposely chose to line up at Rucker's register, because he enjoyed interacting with him. I heard from a parent who appreciated how Rucker, who ran the store's workshops for kids, had handled their child's birthday party.

And this is the guy the store decided to fire?

I knew, as I was writing the column, that it was going to resonate. I knew people would be angry at the company's decision. I still underestimated the reaction. Rucker seemed surprised by all the attention, too.

A few days ago, I asked Rucker, who is 61, if he had any idea why his story moved so many people. It wasn't about him, Rucker said. It was about disgust with declining civility in what he called the ""age of Trump"" and a growing willingness to say anything at all.

I agree that was part of it, as was people's anger at the simple injustice of it all. But there was also, in many of the emails I received, frequent criticism of how so many employees are being treated by the global economy and the big corporations that increasingly control it.

Many readers focused on how Rucker's salary increased by just 78 cents — from $12 to $12.78 an hour — during a decade with the company. That small increase was partly because Rucker had started at a higher-paid store in the Boston area and took a pay cut when he transferred. Still, it's remarkable that his pay didn't even keep up with the rate of inflation.

It's water under the bridge now, at least for Rucker.

After the publicity, several employers reached out to interview him, including Albany County Executive Daniel McCoy, who had a position open in the probation department. That's the job Rucker ultimately took.

On a recent morning, I visited him in his South Pearl Street office, where he spends his days trying to place recent parolees in open jobs. Some have little experience in the working world, but Rucker guides them through the process and prepares them with interviews.

In short, he helps the parolees get a new start. It's satisfying and important work. Plus, the hours are regular.

""Maurice is just what we needed,"" said Mike O'Connor, his supervisor, who echoed what so many others said by describing Rucker as a kind gentleman. ""I got lucky on this one,"" O'Connor added.

In his early days on the job, Rucker sensed that some of his co-workers were wary of him, fearing his hiring was more about political optics than merit. But Rucker earned trust and won his co-workers over. He looks back at the confrontation and his firing as a fortuitous turning point, albeit a terribly unpleasant one.

""It couldn't have worked out any better,"" Rucker told me. ""I'm happy here.""",https://www.timesunion.com/local/article/Churchill-Fired-for-confronting-racism-Maurice-13511148.php
'He was not dying and that was that' - Woman saved husband's life by performing CPR for 30 minutes at home,'He was not dying and that was that' - Woman saved husband's life by performing CPR for 30 minutes at home,1.0,"Geraldine O'Reilly Bolger, a nurse at St Vincent's Hospital in Dublin, saved her husband Derek's life last summer after he took ill at home

A woman who saved her husband's life by performing CPR on him non-stop for 30 minutes after he suffered cardiac arrest in bed has stressed how important it is for everybody to learn the technique.

Geraldine O'Reilly Bolger, a nurse at St Vincent's Hospital in Dublin, saved her husband Derek's life last summer after he took ill at home in bed on the evening last summer in Stillorgan.

Now she is calling for more and more people to learn the skills, especially school children.

Geraldine was asleep in their Stillorgan home in south Dublin on the night of July 5 last year when she noticed some unusual breathing by Derek at around 12.40am.

Geraldine says: ""I gave Derek a dig in the ribs and asked 'Derek are you OK?' I got no response, so I gave him a bigger dig and shouted 'Derek are you OK?' Still no response, so I sat up and turned on my bedside lamp, glanced at Derek, lifted my mobile and dialed 999. I said I need a cardiac ambulance please, my husband is having a cardiac arrest and gave them our address.

""When I had glanced at Derek, he was a purple black colour with dilated black pupils staring up and to the left. The medic on the phone asked me 'is he on a hard surface?'.

""I said 'no he is in the bed'. He said get him on the floor. At this stage I had walked around to Derek's side of the bed. I felt for Derek's pulse and he had a good pulse. So I got him by the ankles and yanked him onto the floor. His body hit the floor with a loud thud. He later developed a large bruise down the left side. His head bounced twice off the floor, I forgot to put a pillow down first. Derek remained unconscious with foaming at the side of the mouth. I said I'm starting CPR.""

The man on the end of the 999 call began to tell Geraldine how to perform CPR but she quickly informed him she was an Intensive Care Unit nurse and knew what to do.

""On my first thrust of compression I heard a crunch,"" Geraldine said. ""I knew I'd broken cartilage, but I thought that's good I'm in the right place and doing it hard enough.""

Geraldine says that the sheer force of her CPR technique probably helped Derek to survive as he was 'under' for so long.

""It made sure that oxygen still made it to the brain. He was not dying and that was that,"" she said.

The medic on the phone continued to encourage Geraldine and when the ambulance was nearby he instructed her to run downstairs, turn off the alarm, open the front door and turn on the lights before running back up the stairs to ""get back on the chest"".

When the ambulance arrived they took over the job of trying to save Derek's life and that is when Geraldine noticed there was ""a river of sweat"" running down her face.

After 20 minutes a doctor came down to the kitchen where Geraldine was.

""He told me they had shocked Derek nine times, given him adrenaline and other drugs and that they had 'done everything'. It dawned on me then that they were stopping.

""So I pointed up the stairs and said 'well get back up there and keep going, keep going, keep going.' The doctor resumed work and about 15 minutes later he returned to say 'he has an output'.

Derek was brought to Geraldine's place of work, St Vincent's, where he was placed in the ICU ward that she knew so well.

""This was the unit I had worked in for years, but this was the wrong face in the bed,"" Geraldine said.

Geraldine's husband was sedated and because he had been under cardiac arrest for so long there were concerns about the levels of oxygen starvation to his brain.

Meanwhile, he had first degree burns from the friction of prolonged CPR, as well as fractured ribs.

His chest was also cut and scraped from trying to get the hair off in order to get a clean contact for the defibrillator pads.

Geraldine then noticed that she too had an injury, friction burns on her knees from the prolonged CPR.

After contacting her two young sons who were both abroad last summer and telling them the news, Geraldine returned to hospital to monitor her husband as family and friends arrived to offer support.

On July 7, a nursing colleague burst in to the waiting room to tell Geraldine that her husband was awake and after he was taken off life support, Geraldine went in to see him.

""I said: 'Derek you look fantastic.' He smiled at me and asked 'am I dead?' I said 'no you are not'. Then he looked around his arm for his watch and asked me 'am I late for work?' I said 'no Derek you have today off. He said 'I don't know what happened to me'. I said 'you were a bit sick last night, so I brought you into the hospital and you are absolutely fantastic now.

""'I don't remember anything' he said. I said 'well I remember everything'.""

After about a week in the Cardiac Care Unit Derek returned home and is now completely fine. Experts in the field have told Geraldine that anyone who is 'under' for more than 20 minutes usually has some serious issues caused by lack of oxygen to the brain. Derek was under in total for around an hour so Geraldine's CPR technique was vital to both his survival and full recovery.

A consultant the couple met in September told Geraldine “you are a hero, only for you, we would not be having this meeting today"" and Geraldine now believes more than ever that CPR at home is vital to save lives.

""It isn't like you see in the movies on TV,"" Geraldine says. ""It is hard and it won't bring them back in 30 seconds but it works and everyone should be given the chance to learn how to do it, starting in schools.""

"Holocaust survivor: I'm giving $1 million to help wounded American veterans, to express my thanks","Holocaust survivor: I'm giving $1 million to help wounded American veterans, to express my thanks",1.0,"At 83 years old, I am one of the few remaining Holocaust survivors – thanks to the American troops who rescued me in what seems like a lifetime ago.

Since World War II, I’ve felt a deep connection to American troops for saving my life – a feeling that resurfaces every year on Veterans Day and throughout the holiday giving season.

And so this year I’m saying “thank you” to the American soldiers of the 1940s by donating $1 million to organizations serving wounded American veterans today.

My donation to the Wounded Warrior Project and the Services for Armed Forces program of the American Red Cross is my way of giving back, thanking previous generations of warriors for helping me. I hope this inspires others to give back as well.

Even though more than 70 years have passed since my rescue, it’s not too late to give back. That’s a lesson I hope the next generation recognizes, because it’s all too easy to let procrastination give way to inaction. But action is what brings hope to those who need it.

I have met many American people who I am lucky enough to call my friends. First, Americans saved us. Then decades later, they welcomed us.

As a child, I spent most of World War II hiding from Nazi invaders in my native France, where my parents moved after fleeing the pogroms in Poland. Unfortunately, with the German invasion in 1940, we were again at risk. On July 16, 1942, the French police led a big roundup of Jews in Paris. More than 13,000 Jews were detained before being deported to Nazi death camps.

The police came to our apartment at 6 a.m. My parents managed to take me to my aunt’s home. She was married to a French soldier and was protected.

A few hours later, my mother was arrested as she and my brother were trying to get information about my father, who was hiding in a nearby grocery store. A concierge had pointed them out to the police. They ran, but my mother was not fast enough. She was detained and sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp. She perished there – probably within three weeks.

I was 7, and for the next two years I lived on borrowed time, shielded by other families on the outskirts of Paris. The same was true for my future wife, who was also a child in hiding. If the war had continued much longer, we would not have survived.

I vividly remember the arrival of the hundreds of thousands of American troops who landed in Normandy to liberate us in June 1944. They were our saviors, doling out packets of sweets to half-starved, war-weary children who had almost given up hope for freedom.

The gratitude I feel to these men is beyond words. They freed our country and they saved our lives. Without American troops, my family and I simply would not have existed. I think of that every time I look at our family photos.

Since the end of the war, life has been good to me. I’ve had a successful career as co-owner of one of Europe’s largest home appliance retailers, working alongside my brothers. I’ve also enjoyed raising my family, celebrating extended family gatherings of 20 people.

My wife and I have a deep sense of gratitude for America. So in the early 1990s, freshly retired, we bought a home in South Florida. I travel with my wife each winter from our home in Paris to the warmth of Miami Beach. We still appreciate our second home there, where we now spend almost a third of our time.

I have met many American people who I am lucky enough to call my friends. First, Americans saved us. Then decades later, they welcomed us.

But as I watched news stories this fall of hurricanes, flooding and wildfires striking America, inflicting suffering among civilians and veterans alike, I realized that I still had an important task left to complete in my life. I had not yet given back to the American soldiers who saved my life nearly three-quarters of a century ago.

That is why I want to help modern American veterans today. They pursue the tradition of the young men who landed on the shores of Normandy in June 1944 and who I will never forget. In giving this donation, I want to thank Americans with all my heart for coming to rescue us in our hour of need.

But I also want to make a public stand in support of America. I hope that my donation can trigger a movement and lead others to take action. My story shows it’s never too late to give back, especially for a cause that’s close to your heart. If it wasn’t too late for this octogenarian, it’s not too late for you.",http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2017/11/25/holocaust-survivor-im-giving-1-million-to-help-wounded-american-veterans-to-express-my-thanks.html
Serena Williams Donates Tennis Prize Money to Australia Wildfire Relief,Serena Williams Donates Prize Money from First Tennis Win in Three Years to Australian Relief Efforts,1.0,"Serena Williams donated her $43,000 prize from Sunday's ASB Classic Match to Australian wildfire relief efforts.

Williams's ASB Classic victory marks her first title win in three years.

Serena Williams won her first big tennis championship title in three years and is using her prize money to pay it forward.

After taking the top spot at Sunday’s ASB Classic Match in Auckland, New Zealand, the tennis icon announced her decision to donate her winnings from the competition to Australian wildfire relief efforts. Williams’s title win—the first since the birth of her daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr., in 2017—against American player Jessica Pegula resulted in a cash prize equivalent to $43,000.

“I’ve been playing Australia for over 20 years and it’s been really hard for me to watch all the news and everything that’s been happening in Australia with all the fires and over a billion animals and people who have lost their homes,” said Williams. “So I decided that I would donate all my prize money for a great cause.”

This content is imported from Instagram. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.

Since the start of the tragic wildfires in September, the natural disaster has claimed 25 human lives and depleted almost half a billion mammals, reptiles, and birds.

Williams is scheduled to return to Australia next week for the start of the Australian Open, where she has previously won seven of her 23 Grand Slam singles titles. According to CNN , Australian Open organizers are planning to proceed with the competition even with the ongoing wildfires.

“In the unlikely case of extreme smoke conditions, the roofs will be closed on the 3 stadium courts and play will continue in their air-conditioned, air-filtered environment,” stated the official Australian Open Twitter account.

Williams joins a growing list of celebrities who have brought awareness to the ongoing Australian wildfires and donated money toward relief efforts. Leonardo DiCaprio, Kylie Jenner, Nicole Kidman, and Hilary Duff are all stars who have donated to the Australia Wildfire Fund, and even Queen Elizabeth II and members of the royal family have spoken out in support of Australia.

Austria is turning site of Hitler's birth into a police station to repel neo-Nazis,Austria is turning site of Hitler's birth into a police station to repel neo-Nazis,1.0,"Austria's Interior Minister Wolfgang Peschorn announced Tuesday that the country will turn the birthplace of Adolf Hitler into a police station in the hopes of preventing it from becoming a neo-Nazi shrine.

""The future use of the house by the police should send an unmistakable signal that the role of this building as a memorial to the Nazis has been permanently revoked,"" Peschorn said in a statement.

Neo-Nazis have reportedly long frequented the house in downtown Braunau am Inn, turning it into a pilgrimage site of sorts. The government has tried to step in and stop that from happening for quite a while, but the building's owner had refused sell it even though the interior ministry had taken over the main lease in 1972. The owner also refused to renovate the building, which meant it was difficult to rent to tenants who would turn it into an administrative, educational, or social services building as required by the government. So it remained challenging to prevent Hitler's admirers from flocking to it, even as support for Nazism dwindled. But the government seized the building in 2017, and will now hold a redesign competition for architects that will begin this month as the building transitions into the hands of law enforcement.

The timing of the announcement is not insignificant, as some far-right parties have continued to make gains in Europe. Read more at The New York Times. Tim O'Donnell",https://theweek.com/speedreads/879727/austria-turning-site-hitlers-birth-into-police-station-repel-neonazis
Japan has officially recognised a same-sex couple as foster parents,"Japan has officially recognised a same-sex couple as foster parents, marking a first for the country and signalling a growing recognition of LGBTQ rights in Japan.",1.0,"Japan has officially recognised a same-sex couple as foster parents, marking a first for the country and signalling a growing recognition of LGBTQ rights in Japan.

The city of Osaka recognised two men, one in his 40s and one in his 30s, as foster parents on Wednesday.

A teenage boy has been living under their care since February.

""I am happy we became foster parents [and recognised] as a single household, not just as individuals,"" the older of the two men told The Japan Times, who added that the boy was now ""living a comfortable life.""

The couple were certified as foster parents after the city determined that they ""understood the foster care system and had the financial wherewithal to raise a child.""

The couple had submitted their request to be recognised as foster parents in late 2015. They had to undergo lectures, training, scrutiny and a screening by the city's social welfare panel before they were certified.

The legal recognition comes amid what appears to be a society warming toward recognising the rights of LGBTQ people in the country.

Earlier last month, Japan updated its national bullying prevention policy to include protection for LGBTQ students.

In 2015, the Shibuya district in Tokyo was the first in Japan to recognise same-sex marriage, with the ward issuing certificates recognising same-sex unions as ""equivalent to marriage.""",http://mashable.com/2017/04/06/lgbtq-japan-osaka/#sjzeJnlh9iq5

But what started as a peaceful protest took a turn and became “violent and destructive around 2:40 p.m.,” Seattle police said. Several cars were set on fire, including police and transit vehicles and dozens of downtown businesses were tagged with graffiti, damaged or looted, including Nordstrom, Target, Old Navy, and T-Mobile.

Police at times deployed flash bangs to disperse crowds and pepper-sprayed demonstrators who got close to police lines. Although many dispersed, dozens remained downtown setting fires and breaking into retail stores after Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan issued a 5 p.m. curfew.

But as the sun began to rise in downtown Seattle, another sight was seen: community members turning out to help clean up the streets and secure and board up businesses.

Seattle Police Department Chief Carmen Best and Mayor Jenny Durkan were both downtown by 9 a.m. surveying the damage and speaking to volunteers helping clean the streets.

Chief Best said she was ""totally inspired"" by what she saw from the community turning out to help clean their neighborhood and city.

“I’m totally inspired. It’s totally gratifying and so wonderful and heartening to see all of these people out here. Volunteers helping to clean up the destruction, and the graffiti, and all of the damage from last night,” said Chief Best. “I’m really hopeful that calmer heads will prevail today and they won’t come into our beautiful city and make it look like this.”

Mayor Durkan said that Saturday was a “tough day for our city,” but said she loved seeing people coming downtown to help clean up and move forward.

“We can’t let the violence and the destruction that happened override the message of Mr. Floyd’s death. People were rightfully protesting, there was many peaceful protests, but obviously, it degenerated very quickly,” Mayor Durkan said. “What I love to see here is so many people coming downtown to help. To help clean up, to remove graffiti, to reclaim the city that they love. That’s the spirit we have to be about going forward, is people coming together and find a way to really acknowledge the challenges that we have, make them better, but still love our city.”

After seeing what happened Saturday, Brian O’Kelly said he drove in from Woodinville Sunday morning to help with the cleanup effort.",https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/downtown-seattle-protest-cleanup/281-6d71487c-1951-4ef8-a86d-be02e480f684
Colin Kaepernick will help provide legal assistance for Minneapolis protesters after death of George Floyd,Colin Kaepernick will help provide legal assistance for Minneapolis protesters after death of George Floyd,1.0,"Colin Kaepernick will provide financial assistance to protesters in Minneapolis who need legal representation.

In posts on Twitter and Instagram on Friday afternoon, Kaepernick said legal assistance will be paid for by his Know Your Rights Camp. The group is devoted to educating and empowering young people of color, and developing a new generation of leaders.

“In fighting for liberation there's always retaliation. We must protect our Freedom Fighters,” Kaepernick said.

Minneapolis has been rocked by protests following the death of George Floyd. Floyd, who was black, died Monday after a white police officer knelt on his neck for eight minutes, ignoring Floyd’s cries that he couldn’t breathe and witnesses’ pleas to stop. A bystander recorded the encounter.

The officer, Derek Chauvin, and three others who did not intervene were fired. Chauvin was arrested Friday.

Police used tear gas and water cannons on what were largely peaceful protests Tuesday in Minneapolis. The demonstrations have become more violent since then, with several buildings burned and looted. On Thursday night, a police station was taken over and set ablaze.

OPINION:After George Floyd's death, do you still think Colin Kaepernick's knee was the problem?

Kaepernick had expressed support for the protesters Thursday.

“When civility leads to death, revolting is the only logical reaction,"" he said in posts on Instagram and Twitter. ""The cries for peace will rain down, and when they do, they will land on deaf ears, because your violence has brought this resistance.

“We have the right to fight back!”

Floyd’s death is another example of the police brutality against people of color that prompted Kaepernick, then a quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, to begin protesting in 2016.",https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2020/05/29/george-floyd-colin-kaepernick-offers-protesters-legal-help-minneapolis/5284550002/

As coronavirus cases again surge across the country, the outdoors remains a rare and safe refuge for Americans, particularly for those struggling with anxiety or depression due to the pandemic.

On Wednesday, those hoping to reap the benefits of fresh air and the unseasonably warm weather in much of the country can explore national parks and forests for free in honor of Veterans Day.

And the Department of Veterans Affairs announced U.S. military veterans and gold star families will be granted a lifetime of free access to national parks, wildlife refuges and other federal lands managed by the Department of the Interior.

""With the utmost respect and gratitude, we are granting Veterans and Gold Star Families free access to the iconic and treasured lands they fought to protect starting this Veterans Day and every single day thereafter,"" said Secretary of the Interior David L. Bernhardt.

The access passes, called America the Beautiful, currently cost $80 per year and grant entry to more than 2,000 federal recreation sites spread out across more than 400 million acres of public lands, including Yosemite, Grand Canyon, Arches and Mount Rushmore National Memorial.

To get the free pass, veterans must provide some form of identification showing they were in the armed forces or the U.S. National Guard and Reserves. Gold star families are those who have lost a family member who was serving in a war or a military operation outside of the U.S. or in an international terrorist attack.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention encourages people to visit parks and camps: ""Staying physically active is one of the best ways to keep your mind and body healthy.""

The agency advises adventurers to follow general COVID-19 prevention guidelines, including avoiding crowded parks and campgrounds, practicing social distancing, wearing a mask and washing hands often. The CDC also recommends visiting parks and recreation areas that are close to home.",https://www.npr.org/2020/11/09/933277526/veterans-and-gold-star-families-granted-lifetime-passes-to-national-parks

Kidderminster Shuttle

STOURBRIDGE, England — A 101-year-old British man has returned home after beating coronavirus, according to the hospital that treated him.

The man spent two weeks battling the virus at the Alexandra Hospital in Redditch, England, according to Worcestershire Acute Hospitals National Health Service Trust. The BBC identified the man as Keith Watson; the hospital released only the patient's first name.

The hospital shared a photograph of Watson with staff in a post that said: ""Well done to everyone on Ward 12 at the Alexandra Hospital for looking after Keith so well for the past two weeks.""

Health experts and government officials have long warned the virus preys on the elderly, putting a centenarian such as Watson at high risk.

Matthew Hopkins, chief executive of Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust said: “We are delighted that Keith could be safely discharged home. This is a huge morale boost for our staff who are working day in day out to provide the best possible care for our patients.”

The BBC reports Watson went to the hospital for treatment after a fall but tested positive for COVID-19 after he developed a fever.

The news of Watson's recovery comes on the same day that the condition of Britain's leader continued to improve, according to a statement. Prime Minister Boris Johnson was moved out of an intensive care unit where he was being treated for coronavirus to a regular hospital ward.

Britain's death toll was nearing 8,000 on Thursday, according to Public Health England, increasing by nearly 900 in a 24-hour period.

Chance the Rapper Hosts Holiday Party to Help the Homeless,Chance the Rapper Hosts Holiday Party to Help the Homeless,1.0,"‘Tis the season for giving, and Chance the Rapper is no Scrooge.

The 24-year-old hip hop star hosted a holiday party at The Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago last week to raise money for homeless children. According to an analysis by the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless (CCH), there are over 82,000 homeless people in the Windy City, while more than 18,000 public school students do not have a home.

“Being the city that has one of the worst and coldest winters in America, I think it’s important to take some time to appreciate and work with and work for the homeless population in Chicago,” Chance told the crowd at the event, reports ABC local affiliate WLS.

In addition to hearing from the Chicago rapper, attendees were treated to dancing and a live performance from the Chicago Children’s Choir, all for $15 per ticket. Needy students, however, were free of charge. The proceeds and goods collected at the event will be donated toward Chicago’s homeless.

The party, which was titled “A Night at the Museum,” was organized by Chance’s non-profit, SocialWorks, in collaboration with several other community groups like Bargains in a Box, which donated hundreds of backpacks full of toys for Chicago families. “It takes a little bit of effort from a lot of people to make a huge impact on a family, to change the way their holiday goes and it’s what the season’s about,” said Bargains in a Box VP of Strategy and Development Brad Nardick, according to Fox 32 Chicago.

“We know that a lot of homelessness isn’t seen, it’s hidden. It’s really important for people to recognize when you see someone on the street that’s just a sliver of the problem,” said CCH Executive Director Doug Schenkelberg.

Chance, who often uses his star power to shine a light on Chicago Public School (CPS) children, recently paid a surprise visit to fifth-graders at Adam Clayton Powell Jr., Paideia Academy. During his visit, the Grammy Award-winning artist revealed that SocialWorks received a $1 million donation from Google’s charity arm to help fund CPS.",http://www.blackenterprise.com/chance-rapper-holiday-party-homeless/

"When a California city gave people a guaranteed income, they worked more — not less","When a California city gave people a guaranteed income, they worked more — not less - Stockton’s experiment shows what $500 per month in “free money” can do for employment, mental health, and more.",1.0,"The city of Stockton, California, embarked on a bold experiment two years ago: It decided to distribute $500 a month to 125 people for 24 months — with no strings attached and no work requirements. The people were randomly chosen from neighborhoods at or below the city’s median household income, and they were free to spend the money any way they liked. Meanwhile, researchers studied what impact the cash had on their lives.

The results from the first year of the experiment, which spanned from February 2019 to February 2020, are now in. And they’re extremely encouraging for its participants, and for advocates who see unconditional cash transfers as an effective way to help people escape poverty.

The most eye-popping finding is that the people who received the cash managed to secure full-time jobs at more than twice the rate of people in a control group, who did not receive cash. Within a year, the proportion of cash recipients who had full-time jobs jumped from 28 percent to 40 percent. The control group saw only a 5 percent jump over the same period.

The researchers wrote in their report that the money gave recipients the stability they needed to set goals, take risks, and find new jobs. One man in his 30s had been eligible for a real estate license for over a year but hadn’t gotten it because he just couldn’t afford to take time off work. Thanks to the freedom offered by the extra $500 per month, he said, his life was “converted 360 degrees … because I have more time and net worth to study … to achieve my goals.”

Critics of cash assistance programs often say that handing out “free money” will make people less inclined to find jobs. But in the research done to date, unconditional cash does not tend to disincentivize work. In several programs — from Alaska and North Carolina in the US, to Finland and Spain in Europe — it has had no effect on employment either way. In some cases, it seems to embolden people with an entrepreneurial bent; for instance, in Japan, initial survey results have shown that recipients are 3.9 times more interested in launching a new business.

Employment aside, there are clear benefits to unconditional cash programs. The Stockton experiment — which was conducted as a randomized controlled trial and underwent an independent evaluation — adds to the growing body of evidence from basic income experiments around the world, which shows that getting unconditional cash tends to boost happiness, health, school attendance, and trust in social institutions, while reducing crime.

More benefits — and some limitations — of Stockton’s guaranteed income trial

There were other benefits from the Stockton program. Cash recipients reported being less anxious and depressed than the control group. On average, the recipients “experienced clinically and statistically significant improvements in their mental health that the control group did not — moving from likely having a mild mental health disorder to likely mental wellness over the year-long intervention,” according to the researchers.

The cash also enabled recipients to help their family and friends. For example, one woman used the cash to help her siblings buy school clothes for their kids and to help her daughter-in-law pay for car insurance. Another bought diapers for her grandchildren.

This isn’t the first time we’ve seen cash programs have positive ripple effects on the broader community. In Kenya, cash transfers have stimulated the economy and benefited not only the recipients themselves but also people in nearby villages.

It’s worth noting a wrinkle in the Stockton trial: Each participant was given $500 per month on a debit card so that researchers would be able to see how they were using the money. However, 40 percent of it was either withdrawn as cash or transferred to an existing bank account, so researchers had to rely on participants to tell them where the money went.

Of the money tracked on the debit cards, recipients spent most on necessities like food (37 percent), home goods and clothes (22 percent), utilities (11 percent), and car costs (10 percent). They spent less than 1 percent on alcohol or cigarettes.

Though these numbers can’t capture the full picture, they offer a counter to harmful stereotypes and faulty assumptions: that people who become poor get that way because they’re bad at rational decision-making and self-control, and that they’ll blow free money on frivolous things or addictive substances. The evidence does not support these beliefs.

The Stockton experiment was a small study with only 125 cash recipients, so the findings should be seen as offering supporting evidence on the effectiveness of cash programs rather than as definitive standalone proof. Nevertheless, the results of this philanthropically funded program — officially known as the Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration (SEED), which received a $1 million grant from the Economic Security Project — help underscore that poverty is a lack of cash, not character, and usefully add to the body of evidence that free money doesn’t disincentivize employment — it can actually boost it.

The implications for policy, during the pandemic and beyond

The message that free money can actually improve job prospects comes at a critical moment, as the Biden administration tries to push through a pandemic aid package that would include direct checks to millions of Americans.

The pandemic has made the idea of direct payments more popular. With the Covid-19 crisis generating so much financial loss and uncertainty, advocates have argued that citizens desperately need some sort of income floor. And against this backdrop, SEED has spawned something much bigger: Mayors for a Guaranteed Income, a coalition of mayors who are pushing for the US to implement a federal guaranteed income. Both SEED and the mayoral coalition are the brainchild of Michael Tubbs, the former mayor of Stockton.

For years now, Tubbs has promoted the idea that a guaranteed income could transform life for Stockton residents, but he’s also made clear this experiment is about a lot more than just his city. “Stockton is a proxy for America: its diversity, its people,” he said. “It’s a place that’s emerging and has big, bold ideas.”

Guaranteed income is a big, bold idea that could improve life for millions of Americans if implemented more widely. That said, it’s not a cure-all for the systemic obstacles that keep people from a healthy, stable life.

As the SEED researchers wrote in their report, “Guaranteed income should not be considered as a singular approach for household stability, but rather as one policy option to be implemented alongside others to shore up market failures.” Other policy options include increasing the supply of affordable housing and raising the minimum wage.

For now, only the first year’s worth of data from the Stockton experiment is available; we have to wait until 2022 for the full results. But the first-year findings signal that guaranteed income programs — combined with better public policy — could go a long way toward fighting poverty.",https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22313272/stockton-basic-income-guaranteed-free-money

But then a kind stranger in front of her in line offered to pay--the whole bill.

She had no idea who the stranger was until a cashier clued her in: It was the rapper Ludacris.

Therra Gwyn-Jaramillo has been ""struggling on and off,"" since her beloved husband died of cancer in the summer of 2014. ""There wasn't a part of my life that wasn't destroyed - emotional, physical, financial,"" Gwyn-Jaramillo told CBS News.

She was left to take care of ""a practical menagerie of rescued animals,"" her disabled brother and her home. While she has been freelance writing to keep her head above water, a recent hit of $4,000 for home repairs and a late check put her in a dire situation in July.

Thankfully, a friend stepped in to help and provided her with a $250 Whole Foods gift card.

Therra Gwyn-Jaramillo pictured with one of four of her rescue dogs. Therra Gwyn-Jaramillo

So, she went to Whole Foods, but at the checkout counter realized she didn't have enough money on the card to cover her items. That's when the stranger in front of her stepped in.

""I had zero interaction with him before he decided to buy my groceries. I tried to put things back and he said, 'I said I got this. All of this. Don't put anything back!' recounts Gwyn-Jaramillo. ""He started putting the stuff I was going to put back onto the conveyor belt. I was stunned.""

Gwyn-Jaramillo says she responded to the ""nice-looking man,"" by ""crying.""

""I finally managed to say 'What is your name?' and introduce myself. He said, simply, 'Chris,' and shook my hand,"" Gwyn-Jaramillo recounted. She spoke with the stranger after his kind deed, telling CBS News, the man asked her about her rescue dogs after noticing dog food on the conveyor belt.

'I talked to him through my tears and finally asked, 'Who ARE you?' says Gwyn-Jaramillo. ""He looked at me and said 'Just a person. Just a guy.' I kept thinking, 'Does he know? Does he know he's an angel? ""

It turns out the stranger was not, in fact, ""just a guy,"" after all.

Gwyn-Jaramillo said while he looked familiar, and says she is a fan of the Grammy-winning rapper, she didn't place him until a cashier filled her in.

""WHAT I screamed,"" Gwyn-Jaramillo told CBS News. ""People were smiling and laughing (and probably rolling their eyes that I just now 'got it' about who he was).""

She says she was inspired to write, a now viral, Facebook post about her encounter.

LEGO hope to make most of their products from sustainable sugarcane by 2030,LEGO launch their first sustainable blocks made from sugarcane – and they hope to roll it out to most products by 2030,1.0,"On August 1, 2018, LEGO launched their first sustainable building bricks.

LEGO wants the majority of its production to be sustainable by 2030.

The new bricks are made of sugarcane plastic and are shaped like plants.



Danish toymaker LEGO has high ambitions for its sustainability program: by 2030, the company intends to manufacture most of its products and packaging using environmentally friendly materials or recycled sources.

In 2018, the company took its first step towards these goals by introducing plastic blocks made of plant-based materials — in the shape of plants. The company announced the introduction of sustainable LEGO blocks in March this year.

From August 1, they were available to customers in selected countries. Elements of the set will also appear in other sets of blocks over the course of 2018, according to Business Insider Polska .

LEGO's new blocks are 98% polyethylene, made from sugar cane.

The material use of sugarcane plastic is in line with the guidelines of LEGO's partner World Wildlife Fund (WWF) but LEGO blocks are still not biodegradable.

""At the LEGO Group we want to make a positive impact on the world around us, and are working hard to make great play products for children using sustainable materials,"" said Tim Brooks, Vice President of Environmental Responsibility at the LEGO Group in March.",https://www.businessinsider.com/lego-go-eco-friendly-with-blocks-made-from-sugarcane-2018-8/?r=AU&IR=T
"Spain is getting rid of streets named after fascist leaders, dedicating them to women instead — Quartz","Spain is getting rid of streets named after fascist leaders, dedicating them to women instead",1.0,"Though Francisco Franco’s totalitarian Spanish regime was toppled nearly 40 years ago, its legacy is still present in the country. Walk through the cities of Spain, and you’re likely to find streets named after regime members like general José Millán Astray, attorney Adolfo Muñoz Alonso, minister José Enrique Varela, and many more (link in Spanish).

But not for long.

In February, the government—applying a 2007 law that promised to get rid of the marks of autocratic heritage in public spaces—announced it would retire these street names. Now, cities around the country are renaming them after women, answering the complaint that about 90% of streets in Spain’s cities are named after men—and those honoring women usually reference saints (link in Spanish).

Janette Sadik-Khan, former New York City transportation commissioner, once famously said, “if you can change the street, you can change the world.” If she’s right, Spain is on its way to a metaphorical revolution. Since 2005, the city of Cordoba has enforced a mandate that half of new streets be named after women. In Barcelona, the total number of streets named after women went from 7% in 1996 to 27.7% in 2010 (link in Spanish).

To further correct the imbalance, Valencia will now name 80% of its new streets after women, and Bilbao, Oviedo and Cádiz plan to follow that example.

Many of the streets have or will be named after Spanish women targeted during Franco’s regime, including activists, revolutionaries, and civil rights fighters, such as Soledad Cazorla, the first public prosecutor to specialize in gender violence. Others will carry the names of women of remarkable talent, from Spain and the rest of the world, who distinguished themselves in fields such as physics, or equal rights movements. In the city of Léon, where the selection of name is made by popular vote, a recent group of possible street names included American civil rights activist Rosa Parks, Mexican painter Frida Kahlo, English novelist Jane Austen, and Spanish inventor Ángela Ruiz Robles.

Other countries should take note: the lack of streets named after women is far from just a Spanish problem. In Rome, for instance, only 3.5% of streets carry a woman’s name. In 2015, a study of seven world metropolis (London, Paris, San Francisco, Mumbai, New Delhi, Chennai, and Bangalore) found that only 27.5% streets were named after women.",http://qz.com/850588/spain-streets-named-after-women/
A billionaire is opening a new mental health center in Colorado to treat veterans and their families,A billionaire is opening a new mental health center in Colorado to treat veterans and their families,1.0,"About half of U.S. military veterans who served in Iraq or Afghanistan don’t receive the mental health treatment they need, and the vast Veterans Health Administration system often doesn’t offer care for veterans’ families or for many veterans who were not honorably discharged.

So, on Monday, a new clinic funded by one of the nation’s wealthiest men and linked with the University of Colorado will officially open in Greenwood Village to help meet the need.

“I think we’ll be able to get folks in and get them the help they need when they’re motivated to seek it,” said Anthony Hassan, the CEO of the Cohen Veterans Network.

The Cohen Veterans Network is the charitable project of Steven A. Cohen, a former hedge fund titan who, with an estimated net worth of $11 billion, is ranked by Forbes as the 133rd-richest person in the world. In 2016 — at the urging of his son, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran — Cohen pledged $275 million to build a network of veterans clinics across the country.

Denver’s clinic is among 10 so far spread out in military towns and major cities. The clinics serve all post-9/11 veterans, regardless of whether they were honorably discharged or not. The clinics also provide services to veterans’ family members or other people — such as close friends or girlfriends or boyfriends — whom the veterans identify as caregivers.

“It’s the family that’s the primary support system for the veteran,” said Gillian Kaag, who holds a doctorate in psychology and is the Denver clinic’s director.

The idea is to create a welcoming environment with as many ways as possible for veterans and their families to access mental health services. The clinic’s 10,000-square-foot space on East Orchard Road is decorated with art by local veterans or military families. There are rooms for one-on-one therapy sessions but also family rooms and a community room. Yoga classes are planned.

The clinic’s No. 1 goal, as Kaag put it, is to get veterans and their families, “back to better.”

Services will be provided free of charge to people without insurance. Those with insurance can access care for only the cost of a copay — usually just a few dollars.

The clinic hopes to serve 500 to 1,000 patients in its first year. It also hopes to expand, eventually establishing a satellite clinic in Colorado Springs and offering telehealth services to veterans across Colorado and in neighboring states, Hassan said.

Kaag said all patients calling in for the first time will speak with an intake coordinator on the same day. The clinic plans to offer initial evaluations within a week of a patient’s first contact. Staff will conduct regular patient satisfaction surveys.

The clinic’s partnership with CU — especially with a brain health treatment center for veterans and another center that cares for people with depression — will provide access to a greater array of services while also creating research opportunities, Hassan said.

“We’re not here to do it all,” Hassan said. “We’re here to fill gaps.”

Rivera told the newspaper he expects 150 to 200 students in the 500-student senior class to apply for college, but that number could go higher. He said he hopes the donation will encourage students to apply to college early, which may give them a better chance of being accepted and receiving financial aid packages.

""My hope is that it's an incentive for kids to do the right thing,"" Rivera told AJC.

Rivera, who became superintendent in 2016, is entitled to a bonus every three years, but said his work alone isn't what earns him the extra cash — it's the work of the entire school system's employees. ""I don't believe that a bonus provided by the board should be earned on the backs of the teachers,"" Rivera said.

The news about Rivera's donation was shared on the school district's Facebook page. Many people thanked him for being so caring toward the students and a true leader.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/school-superintendent-donates-his-10000-bonus-to-high-school-seniors-applying-for-college/
Microsoft will pay hourly workers regular wages even if their hours are reduced because of COVID-19 concerns – TechCrunch,Microsoft will pay hourly workers regular wages even if their hours are reduced because of COVID-19 concerns,1.0,"As more COVID-19 cases are identified in the United States, some companies are asking employees to work from home if possible. But that impacts the jobs of people who work in on-site operations, including many who are paid by the hour. Today Microsoft said that it will continue paying all vendor hourly service providers in Puget Sound and Northern California their usual wage, even if their work hours are reduced.

The announcement specifically refers to Microsoft workers in the Puget Sound region and Northern California, but the company said it will “[explore] how to best move forward in a similar way in other parts of the country and the world that are impacted by COVID-19.”

In a blog post, Microsoft president Brad Smith wrote that employees in those regions who can work from home have been asked to do so.

“As a result, we have reduced need in those regions for the on-site presence of many of the hourly workers who are vital to our daily operations, such as individuals who work for our vendors and staff our cafes, drive our shuttles and support our on-site tech and audio-visual needs,” he said. “We recognize the hardship that lost work can mean for hourly employees. As a result, we’ve decided that Microsoft will continue to pay all our vendor hourly service providers their regular pay during this period of reduced service needs.”

Smith added, “While the work to protect public health needs to speed up, the economy can’t afford to slow down. We’re committed as a company to making pubic health our first priority and doing what we can to address the economic and social impact of COVID-19. We appreciate that what’s affordable for a large employer may not be affordable for a small business, but we believe that large employers who can afford to take this type of step should consider doing so.”

Microsoft is among several tech companies that have asked employees in places where COVID-19 cases have been identified to work from home, like Washington state and California, including Google, Lyft and Square. Concerns about the COVID-19 have also led to the cancellations of major events, like Mobile World Congress and Google’s I/O developer conference.",https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/05/microsoft-will-pay-hourly-workers-regular-wages-even-if-their-hours-are-reduced-because-of-covid-19-concerns/
Bernie Sanders Turned His Inauguration Meme Into a Sweatshirt for Charity,Bernie Sanders Turned His Inauguration Meme Into a Sweatshirt for Charity,1.0,"Bernie Sanders’ campaign has turned the viral photo of him bundled up at Joe Biden’s inauguration into a new sweatshirt, with all proceeds going to charity.

The “Chairman Sanders Crewneck” — named to honor Sanders’ assumption of the powerful Senate Budget Committee chair now that Democrats control the chamber — is on sale now for $45, with 100 percent of the proceeds going to Meals on Wheels Vermont. The absurd popularity of the meme, however, seems to have already caused a glut in orders, with a note on the site cautioning, “Due to overwhelming demand for this item, it may be a few weeks until you receive your sweatshirt.”

The photo of Sanders at the inauguration, taken by Brendan Smialowski for Getty Images, was probably the most unexpectedly memorable image to come out of Biden’s inauguration. The photo captured Sanders at his normcore best: crossed legs, crossed arms, big fuzzy mittens over his hands, face mask properly covering nose, mouth and chin, yet also just slightly askew. Capping it all off, Sanders’ gray jacket was clearly the same one he was wearing in the “I am once again asking… ” meme that emerged during his 2020 presidential bid (if anything, it’s just proof that a person truly only needs one good coat).

The photo of Sanders quickly took off as a meme, with people dropping the seated Senator into classic paintings, movie stills, album covers, historical photos and other memes. His pose was also perfect fodder for reaction memes to convey annoyance at everything from unnecessary meetings to four-band concert bills.

Sanders, for his part, seemed generally amused, though mainly unfazed by his latest meme-ification. During an interview with Seth Meyers on Late Night Thursday, Sanders said of the photo, “I was just sitting there, trying to keep warm, trying to pay attention to what was going on.”

And in classic Sanders fashion, rather than focus too much on the memes, he took the opportunity to shout out the Vermont schoolteacher, Jen Ellis, who made his eco-friendly mittens and has already sold out the rest of her supply.",https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/bernie-sanders-meme-inauguration-sweatshirt-charity-1117854/
Police identify missing dog by seeing if it 'sings' along to a tune,Police identify Missing Husky By Seeing If It Will Sing Along to Its Favorite Tune,1.0,"This is the heartwarming moment police identified a missing dog by testing to see if it could 'sing' along to its favourite tune.

The Siberian Husky was played a few songs before it burst into a series of ear-splitting howls when his track was played.

When the dog was found the suspected owner was contacted who insisted they would be able to identify him by playing two songs.

The owner said that his husky would sing along to the Israeli sitcom Shemesh theme tune or introduction to the children's programme, Arthur.

He had been reported missing by his owner who lives in the city of Beer Sheva, in the Southern District of Israel.

A dog that matched the description of the missing husky was spotted by police officers when they were out on patrol.

A husky howled to the theme tune of Israeli sitcom Shemesh when police played it for him

The husky was found with a group of teenagers who said that he looked malnourished when they found him in a field.

Suspecting that it might be the missing dog, police contacted the owner - who was not identified - to suggest that he drive over to check.

He said that was not necessary - they would be able to tell if it was his animal when they played the theme music to the programmes.

The video shows the instant, unmistakable reaction when officers played the right songs using the unusual identification method.

After officers passed on the good news, the overjoyed owner and beloved pet were then seen enjoying an emotional reunion.",http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5607759/Police-identify-missing-dog-testing-sings-favourite-tune.html

Chef José Andrés turns his restaurants into community kitchen,"Chef José Andrés is transforming eight of his acclaimed restaurants in New York City and Washington, DC, into gourmet soup kitchens for those who are struggling to make ends meet in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic",1.0,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.

It’s not all dried beans and packaged ramen — a Michelin-starred chef is serving up free lunch in cities ravaged by the coronavirus.

Chef José Andrés is transforming eight of his acclaimed restaurants in New York City and Washington, DC, into gourmet soup kitchens of sorts for those who are struggling to make ends meet in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic.

While the to-go only meals cost $7 for guests who can afford it, volunteers running the community kitchens will be flexible with patrons who may be out of work or financially constrained due to a near shutdown of daily life. There’s also an option to donate a meal to someone else who might need it.

“Those who cannot afford to pay we will welcome as well,” Andrés said in a statement, adding that many of his restaurants will otherwise be closed.

In New York City, where Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered all restaurants to offer only take-out or delivery, Andrés’ Little Spain’s Spanish Diner in Hudson Yards will operate as a community kitchen from its glass garage doors. The rest of the mercado will remain closed. Some of Andrés’ other restaurants in Washington, DC, will also be serving to-go food.

The community kitchen will be open from noon to 5 p.m. daily beginning Tuesday, March 17, offering only takeout service. Also, all his employees are getting paid leave for at least the first two weeks.

It’s among the measures restaurants around the world are forced to take to address the pandemic. In New York City, restaurants such as Osteria 57 in Greenwich Village are offering discounted menus with to-go service.

But many say they may not be able to weather the financial impact. Jeremy Merrin, who operates the city’s Havana Central chain of Cuban eateries, told The Post last week that his business has dropped 50 percent in recent weeks.

“I’ve lost over $100,000 in catering and events through August, business that I won’t make up again,” Merrin told The Post. “The biggest question right now is whether I stay open or close to preserve my cash.”",https://nypost.com/2020/03/16/chef-jose-andres-turns-his-restaurants-into-community-kitchen/
TPS for the Children,Toyota collaborated with four children's hospitals to reduce a certain type of blood infection by 75%. They used production principles.,1.0,"TSSC Advisor Scott Dickson joined forces with Amy Taylor, clinical manager of Gastroenterology, and other members of the staff at Children's Health in Dallas to find a solution to the problem of central line-associated blood stream infections.

Children's Health staff meet daily to review and tweak their processes, in keeping with the principles of the Toyota Production System.

The hospital employs quantitiave methods to track their progress and identify opportunities for further improvement.

Scott Dickson has enjoyed a very rewarding career over his 15 years with Toyota, including the past five as a senior advisor in the Toyota Production System Support Center (TSSC).But he’s happy to admit that his collaboration with four children’s hospitals in 2016 was especially meaningful.“When you see a sick child at a hospital, it gets pretty emotional,” says Dickson. “If there’s any way we can do something to help them, we’re going to do it. I felt very blessed to get to do this.”In this instance, Dickson’s work put him in partnership with Children’s Health in Dallas, Cook Children’s Hospital in Fort Worth, Texas, Children’s Hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio, and Children’s Hospital of Kings Daughter in Norfolk, Virginia. All shared a similar challenge: Far too often, young patients fitted with a central line – a plastic tube placed in a large vein that routes to the heart – were contracting infections. In medical speak, such events are referred to as Central Line Associated Bloodstream Infections or CLABSIs.According to a study published in the, approximately 250,000 CLABSIs occur annually at hospitals across the country. These infections are serious but often can be treated successfully. However, such countermeasures cost more than $6 billion annually, according to a study published in theAll four of the institutions in the TSSC project were baffled and frustrated by this persistent issue. After all, doctors and nurses at each hospital were following strict hygiene protocols. Yet, somehow, harmful bacteria as well as other germs were getting past their defenses.In keeping with the TPS principle of(or “go and see”), Dickson spent time at each hospital observing and taking notes. That unbiased perspective proved to be the turning point. In each case, healthcare practitioners were following the proper steps to ensure they were germ free. But the rooms in which the children were being treated? That was a very different story.So, for example, while a nurse might don sterile gloves to operate a medical device, he or she might inadvertently place that device on a counter or blanket that was not sterile.“What they thought was the problem and what was actually the problem turned out to be very different things,” says Dickson. “There’s no way we would have figured it out if we hadn’t spent time at each site and talked with the nurses on the floor.”Once they’d identified the culprit, Dickson said the next step was to apply Toyota’s problem solving methodology to come up with a solution. Then it applied TPS standardization principles so that everyone who might come in contact with patients knew exactly what steps to follow.That included the use of sterile pads to serve as a barrier between a potentially contaminated surface and the medical devices being used to treat the children — such as the chest hubs that are often used in such circumstances.“The way we systemically break down a problem was completely foreign to the people at the hospitals,” says Dickson. “In the end, their reaction was: ‘Oh, my gosh. We never thought of that.’”Through the first six months of full implementation, the objective was to reduce the number of CLABSIs by 50 percent at the four hospitals.“It’s now been more than a year and infections are down 75 percent,” says Dickson. “They’re absolutely thrilled with the progress we’ve made and, if at all possible, looking to eliminate these infections all together.”In keeping with TSSC’s mission, Dickson says he’s helped the hospital partners integrate TPS principles into their ongoing operations so that they can isolate and solve other problems on their own, without Toyota’s help.“They’ve standardized the process,” he says. “Every floor has a visual board where they track their progress. They do audits. And they have a huddle meeting every morning to discuss any events that might have occurred the day before. They problem solve them immediately. Before, they depended on monthly reports.“It all comes back to how we observe and think and then teaching them how to observe and think,” he adds. “TPS works, and not just in manufacturing. I’ve been very fortunate to be involved in many of these projects. But when you can do something to help children, it does make it even more special.”",http://toyotadriverseat.com/community/tssc-childrens-hospitals.htm
Ex-NFL player who made $25 million quit football at age 29 to become a farmer,Ex-NFL Player Who Made $25 Million Quit Football At Age 29 To Become A Farmer to Donate to Food Pantry,1.0,"YouTube

In 2009, Jason Brown signed a five-year, $37.5 million contract with the St. Louis Rams that made him the highest-paid center in the NFL.

Five years later, after earning more than $25 million of that contract, Brown is a farmer who is helping to feed the hungry.

CBS News caught up with Brown in Louisburg, North Carolina, where he runs a 1,000-acre farm after learning how to grow crops on YouTube.

Brown was drafted 124th overall in 2005 and played nine seasons in the NFL before getting cut by the Rams in the spring of 2012.

At age 29, he still had plenty of NFL years ahead of him. He wasn't playing at the level he was in 2009, but his career was far from over. He had interest from numerous teams, including an offer from the Baltimore Ravens.

But he walked away from the game. The NFL world was surprised, and ESPN ran a story with the headline, ""The Curious Case Of Jason Brown.""

""My agent, he told me, 'You're making the biggest mistake of your life,'"" Brown told CBS. ""And I looked right back at him and I said, 'No I am not.'""

CBS

Brown is doing this to help the less fortunate. He grows sweet potatoes and other vegetables and donates his harvest to food pantries. According to the New & Observer, he has given away 46,000 pounds of sweet potatoes and 10,000 pounds of cucumbers this fall.

CBS

""When you see them pop up out of the ground, man it's the most beautiful thing you could ever see,"" he said of harvesting the sweet potatoes.

It does look pretty fun:

Brown went to school at the University of North Carolina. He had no idea how to farm back in 2012. He learned on YouTube.

Guy Fieri helped raise $25 million for restaurant workers in need during the pandemic,Guy Fieri helped raise $25 million for restaurant workers in need during the pandemic,1.0,"As the host of Food Network's ""Diners Drive-ins and Dives,"" Guy Fieri has probably met more restaurant workers than anyone else in the U.S. But when the pandemic hit, the two industries he works in – TV production and restaurants – were shut down.

""I kind of feel like 'Happy Gilmore,'"" Fieri told CBS News. ""He's a hockey player that plays golf. I'm a cook that also does TV.""

Fieri was able to film some of his Food Network shows from his home in Northern California. But like many people, he had a tough year.

""We were separated from my parents for Christmas. Lost some really wonderful friends during this. So, there's been enough to really bum me out, bum us out and get us all down,"" he said. ""But on the other side of it, there's so many people that have it so much worse.""

The host and restauranteur wanted to use his platform to help people in the industry he's spent his life working in. ""You know, so many people work in the restaurant industry in multiple jobs, second jobs, single moms, single parents, students, retirees. And the restaurant industry is massively important to our communities,"" Fieri said.

""And so, when I saw this coming, I said, 'We got to do something to get some money to these folks,'"" he continued.

Fieri joined the Restaurant Employee Relief Fund. With partners like Fieri, and more than 50 companies, the fund collected 15,000 individual donations and raised close to $25 million.

The fund gave $500 grants to 43,000 restaurant workers in all 50 states. Nearly 60 percent of the recipients were women and 50 percent were people of color. ""The reason was, there's a lot of folks that, for various reasons, don't have the resources, have the time, have the ability to get that money,"" he said.

""There was a story that was said to me about someone saying, 'I live in a building with a bunch of people who work in the service industry, and none of us have any money – I don't even have anyone I can borrow money from because nobody I know has any money.' When you start hearing those kinds of things...there's nothing more important.""

Now, the two industries Fieri works in are coming back to life. He's been able to get back on the road to film some episodes of ""Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives,"" or ""Triple D"" – and meeting restaurant workers.

""As I was leaving the 'Triple D' location, getting in the car to go to the next 'Triple D' location, this young manager came out from the restaurant,"" he said. ""She came to me and said, 'You know, I got the money.' I said, 'Oh, that's so awesome.' She said, 'The money was great, but it was just awesome to know that people I don't even know care about how I'm doing.' And I was like, 'Man, that's the whole reason we did this.'""",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/guy-fieri-helped-raise-25-million-for-restaurant-workers-in-need-during-the-pandemic/
How Detroit Tigers pitcher Matt Boyd is saving 36 girls in Uganda,"Detroit Tigers' Matthew Boyd and his wife Ashley Boyd are saving children in Uganda from sex slavery. ""The bad guys aren’t smarter than us. We can end this. We can outsmart them. """,1.0,"These are the children of Detroit Tigers pitcher Matthew Boyd:

One of the girls was working as a sex worker at a bar when she was saved. Another was sold into marriage when she was 9 and her husband forced her into prostitution.

And a third girl was abandoned by her mother after delivery and left on a road.

Matt and his wife, Ashley, have essentially adopted 36 girls in Uganda, trying to protect them from the sex slave industry. The Boyds buy the girls food and clothing, and rent for their home, and get them sandals, and pray for them, and worry about them, and make sure they are safe.

The mission is massive and jaw-dropping in its scope and goal. This isn’t just another professional athlete slapping his name on a charity. The Boyds have created their own nonprofit, Kingdom Home, completing the process a few weeks ago. It was exhausting, time-consuming work.

The Boyds are raising money to buy land to expand in Uganda. Over the next three years, they want to build four new homes, so they can bring in more girls because the need is so great.

“You know what?” Matt says. “We can end child sex trafficking in Uganda. The bad guys aren’t smarter than us. We can end this. We can outsmart them. We can beat them to the kids. We can protect them.”

To do that, they have to raise money. Because this mission has grown bigger than they ever imagined.

And that is why Matt is here, strolling through the concourse at Joker Marchant Stadium, still wearing his cleats, looking out of place in his uniform, mingling with the fans, like he got lost on his way to the dugout before the start of an exhibition game in Lakeland, Florida, the spring training home of the Tigers.

Heads turn. Is that Matt Boyd? What’s he doing up here?

“Are you allowed to do this?” Ashley asks.

“I asked Gardy and he said I could,” Matt says, of Tigers manager Ron Gardenhire.

The Tigers organization has been extremely supportive of the Boyds’ passion to help these girls, giving them support, advice and assistance.

“OK,” she says. “If Gardy says so, then you are good.”

It is early March and a crowd begins to swell, as the Boyds start selling tickets to a March 16 fundraiser at Topgolf in Tampa, trying to raise money for Kingdom Home. They will hold another fundraiser May 20 at Topgolf in Auburn Hills.

“We are hoping to raise $50,000 at this event (in Tampa) — we are shooting for the stars here,” Ashley says. “The whole (Tigers) team is coming.”

The Boyds have jumped headfirst into a complicated, global issue that made headlines recently when a sex trafficking ring was discovered in Jupiter, Florida, that allegedly had been servicing high-profile names like Robert Kraft, the billionaire owner of the New England Patriots. Kraft pleaded not guilty to charges of soliciting prostitution.

An estimated 3.6 million adults and 1 million children were victims of forced sexual exploitation in 2016, according to a study from the United Nations' International Labor Organization.

But the Boyds are trying to fight this issue from the other side, trying to protect the kids who are most vulnerable.

[ Once a sick kid himself, Tigers' Matthew Boyd now inspires others ]

'What are we supposed to do?'

It started one year ago during spring training.

Ashley and Matt were sitting shoulder to shoulder on a couch, in a rented house in Lakeland, talking to Carl Ralston, the director of Remember Nhu, a nonprofit that works to prevent child sex slavery around the world by sponsoring 108 homes in 16 countries.

“We were on Skype, or maybe, it was FaceTime,” Ashley Boyd said.

Ralston told the Boyds about Dorothy Stella Alue, a woman in Uganda, who was giving shelter to 36 girls but she fell into a financial crisis after her husband died. She lost her home and desperately needed help. Ralston gets requests like this constantly. Upon further screening, nine times out of 10, red flags pop up and Ralston declines to help.

But Ralston said that Dorothy’s situation checked out perfectly.

“He just laid out her story,” Ashley said. “We didn’t know where he was going with it. Maybe, he’s just going to ask for money, I don’t know. But then he actually asked if we would wanted to start our own organization to support them. We were shocked. It wasn’t something we expected.”

There was something appealing about it — Matt and Ashley have a deep Christian faith and were searching for a way to serve.

But it was tantalizing, confusing and frightening.

“We said we want to think about it, pray about it,” Ashley said. “We are trying to figure out how to run our own lives, let alone a nonprofit organization. We didn’t immediately jump on it. It was also very daunting. We just brought our first child into the world and now, here, we are going to be responsible for 36 children in Uganda?”

At the time, Matt was entering his third season with the Tigers, a team on the rebuild. He is not a superstar but he’s got a massive heart and wanted to use his platform for something good.

[ Family, faith helped Matthew Boyd raise his game for the Tigers ]

Ashley had always felt a calling to help others, like there was a fire burning deep inside her. She had worked for Remember Nhu out of college.

But they just had a girl, Meira, who is now 1½.

“Ashley and Matt are a great young couple,” Ralston said. “When they heard that Dorothy's husband unexpectedly passed away and that the children literally were struggling to have food to eat, their hearts went out to the children and Dorothy. Ashley and Matt listened very intently and asked great questions about the situation and how they could help.”

The more the Boyds thought about it, the more they prayed about it, they came to a realization. “This is what we were supposed to do,” Ashley said. “That was the start of something way bigger than we ever would have known.”

That started a whirlwind of phone calls, emails and conference calls. Who exactly was Dorothy? Who were these girls? How much danger were they in? What do they need?

And how does somebody set up a nonprofit?

“How does this even work?” Ashley Boyd said. “It was so quick.”

Life in Uganda

Dorothy, a 29-year-old mother of three children, said she started the home seven years ago with her husband after they rescued 25 girls who were being ferried to a city to work as commercial sex workers.

“She kept finding all of these girls, who had been rescued out of situations, who had nowhere to go,” Ashley said. “So she and her husband took them in. Just decided to let this be their mission.” Some of the girls were rescued from the sex trade, others from female genital mutilation and forced early marriages. Others were abandoned or orphaned.

Dorothy had lost her house after her husband died in July 2017.

“My in-laws became wild and turned against me,” Dorothy wrote in an email to the Free Press. “I just lost everything including my academic credentials. They burnt down my house with everything that belonged to me, even my ID card, I just had to apply for a new one. This was because they knew I would inherit my husband's portion of land which they did not want. I moved to a nearby small town and rented a house where I was staying with the girls.”

The rented house didn’t have running water. The girls had to walk 2 kilometers, or about 1.25 miles, every day to a river to get fresh water. Dorothy had no source of income to feed, clothe, pay school fees or pay for medical bills for the girls. She was thinking about abandoning the girls until she reached out in desperation to Remember Nhu and passed the screening process.

“Dorothy is amazing,” Ashley said. “She has a heart for rescuing girls. It kind of stems back to her personal history. She was going to be sold as a childhood bride to her neighbor. She was a little girl.”

Dorothy was a victim of female genital mutilation when she was 10. Before she had healed from the process, her parents received cows and goats from a 55-year-old man. “Which were meant to be my bride price,” Dorothy said.

She ran away from home and found refuge at a Catholic church. “At the church I found a kindhearted and loving nun who upon hearing my story had compassion over me,” Dorothy said. “She took me to live with her friend in Kampala (Uganda’s capital city).”

Dorothy has made it her life mission to help children. And her mission became the Boyds’ mission.

“They loved the girls from the first time they read our story,” Dorothy said. “They devoted themselves to helping us by offering us shelter, food, education by paying the girls' school fees and even spiritual nurture.”

Ashley has a methodical brain like a lawyer but a heart for social issues. She went into hyper-speed, working to create an organization, raising money, going on conference calls, doing research and getting supplies, trying to help in the short term while creating a long-term plan.

“Matt and Ashley have brought a very big difference to me and the girls too,” Dorothy said. “Initially we didn't have a good home, but now we have a home, though rented, but it's a good place. I could not afford buying clothes for the girls but through these wonderful couple, the girls have clothes and even sandals under their feet.

""We now have three meals every day because of Matt and Ashley. We have water running on our tap, we no longer walk the long journey we used to walk in search for water. The girls have good beds and beddings to sleep on. They have balls to play with, which were brought by Matt and Ashley. They go to school in uniform just like the other children. We just feel at home all courtesy of Matt and Ashley. There is a lot Matt and Ashley are planning to do for us and we just thank them so much and pray for them.”

Dorothy calls Matt and Ashley “God sent.”

Ashley calls Dorothy “amazing.”

“She has devoted her life to helping others,” Ashley said. “She chooses joy for the children. She knows she must be a mother to them all and show them the love every child deserves. Being a mother myself I know this can be exhausting to give so much of yourself. But she does it with a constant smile. She is also a beacon of light to her community. People come to her daily to take on more children or for help in other ways because they know what kind of person she is.""

The Boyds' visit

After the Tigers’ 2018 season, Ashley and Matt traveled to Uganda to visit the girls.

But Matt wasn’t exactly comfortable.

“You are going through areas where it looks like a Jason Bourne movie,” he said. “That’s the best way to describe it. It’s scary. For the safety of the girls, we don’t want to say where the home is. It’s special. You come back and it puts things in perspective.”

Ashley laughed when she heard Matt’s description of Uganda.

“It’s so funny,” Ashley said. “He was on edge the whole time. He was Jason Bourne the whole time. Meanwhile, I feel at home. It was wonderful. I felt at peace. Uganda is beautiful. It’s very lush, green rolling hills, super fertile ground, lots of beautiful wild flowers, nothing you would see anywhere else. It’s just incredible.”

The L-shaped house is surrounded by a security fence. Several bedrooms have bunk beds.

When Matt and Ashley arrived, the girls burst out singing.

“It was a long-awaited visit that the girls really yearned for,” Dorothy said. “They were so happy to see them. Some of them could not control their tears as they burst into songs of prayer and thanksgiving. To the girls, Matt and Ashley are their dad and mom.”

The Boyds gave every girl a backpack, a new pair of shoes and school supplies. A church donated homemade dresses for every girl.

“It was Christmas on steroids,” Ashley said. “It was so fun. But they were so respectful. We would hand it to them and they would like, curtsy. Like, thank you. They would walk away and show their friends, all giddy — ah! You know? It was really cute. We came the next day and they were in their new dresses and shoes and they made a song for us.”

The Boyds also brought along letters from the girls’ sponsors. Anyone can sponsor a girl with a $120-a-month donation. About a quarter of the girls are fully sponsored, half are partially sponsored.

“The girls loved the letters,” Ashley said. “They loved seeing the pictures and reading about their families that are supporting them.”

And yes, Matt gave out some baseballs.

“It was amazing being there, seeing the girls be so happy, just like any other kid should,” Matt said.

Every day that the Boyds visited the home, the girls would sing and dance.

“Like we were their honored guest, which is so humbling,” Ashley said. “But just to get to know the girls. I knew their stories and I felt like I knew them, but to meet them and spend time with them and talk to them and see them interact with each other, it was really cool to see each of their different personalities. They live a world away and they have been through things that I could never relate to. But at the end of the day, we are all human. There are the girls who are the natural leaders. There are the girls who are the natural caregivers, who looked after the younger ones. The girls who loved sports. The other ones who love crafts. It was cool to see their different personalities.

“We care for them like they are our own. They are part of our family.”

'We love them ... like our own family'

Ashley, as Matt says, is the “brains” of the operation.

“Dorothy and I are constantly talking back and forth on emails — we’ll talk about everything,” Ashley said.

“We sent the wire today.”

“How are the girls doing on their winter vacation?”

“Hey, is so and so feeling better? I remember she had the flu.”

“Will you fill out the budget?”

“We hold her accountable to fill out spreadsheets, how she uses the funds,” Ashley said.

“We are pretty involved in knowing what is going on in their day-to-day lives. You gotta be thankful for technology in that regard.”

They plan to go back to Uganda next fall after the Tigers’ season.

“We are hoping to bring a group this time, whether it’s sponsors or donors,” Ashley said.

The Boyds are giving these girls more than a safe place to live. They

are trying to prepare them for life. The girls do chores, washing clothes or washing dishes.

The Boyds plan to implement a vocational training program and will pay for each child to attend a university, if they choose that route.

“Our goal is for them to no longer be at risk for child sex slavery,” Ashley said. “If we give them a skill and a value beyond selling their bodies, they will be successful and we will reach our goal.”

But the Boyds, as well as Dorothy, worry about other girls in Uganda who are being married off at a young age.

“Many of the marriages don't work out and so the girls run away to brothels to work as sex workers in order to earn a living and also provide for the children they got from the broken marriages,” Dorothy said. “Some have contracted sexual-related diseases like HIV/AIDS and have died. Their lives are miserable. They cannot afford the basic needs. They don't go to school. Sometimes, I just wish I got a big place and resources, too, to accommodate and reach out to many whom I have personally met and shared their stories with me.

""Some want to go to school but they cannot afford it. They have nowhere to stay especially those who are orphaned. Some have turned to the streets. They have no shelter, no food, no clothes and no one to listen to them. Some have turned into thieves, snatching people's property. Due to this, they are beaten even to death.”

The Boyds' home in Uganda is filled to capacity, so they want to expand.

“We will need new Dorothys and new aunties, but we are turning people away at this point. We are hoping that won’t be the case for too long,” Ashley said.

And it’s only going to get more complicated. The Boyds recently announced that Ashley is now expecting her second child, a boy.

And the Boyds now carry a mixture of emotions — the joy of helping others and the stress of such a massive responsibility, worrying about 36 girls on the other side of the world.

“We love them all like our own family,” Ashley said.

This is such a remarkable, young couple, doing such a remarkable thing. They feel responsibility to care for the children and protect them and to set them on the right path.

“We can end child sex trafficking in Uganda,” Matt repeats.

His eyes tighten and he has such a determined look, no different than when he’s on the mound.

But they can’t do it on their own.

Walgreens Worker Stops Man Trying To Rape Woman Inside Bathroom,Walgreens manager saved a shopper from a sex attack when he heard her screaming in the bathroom and rushed to the rescue,1.0,"NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — A Walgreens worker stopped a man who was trying to sexually assault a woman inside the store’s bathroom in the Bronx, police said.

The 50-year-old victim was getting out of the bathroom at a Walgreens on White Plains Road just before 3:45 p.m. Thursday when police said the suspect pushed her back inside.

He knocked her to the ground, covered her mouth and tried to take off her pants, according to police.

The worker heard the victim screaming for help and pulled the suspect off of her, police said. The suspect ran off on White Plains Road towards East 239th Street.

“I was shocked because it could have been me right, could have been anybody,” Sheneca Nelson told CBS2’s Jessica Layton.

“That’s incredible, it happened here in Walgreens in the middle of the day — just shows how sometimes unsafe we are,” Randy Kearse added.

The unsuspecting woman was over powered and violently shoved back into the restroom. Thankfully a store manager heard the screams as the suspect tried to pull down the victim’s pants. He burst in and pulled the bad guy away.

A sign posted Friday said the restroom is out of order. The door appeared to have been dusted for the perpetrator’s prints.

Police sources said they have the suspect on video running out of the store 9 minutes after he walked in.

Walgreens wouldn’t answer CBS2’s questions, or allow an interview with the courageous employee, but customers couldn’t stop singing his praises.

“He’s a hero indeed,” Allie Berry said.

“He’s an angel and thank god he was around,” Tracey Cooper added.

The victim was treated at Jacobi Hospital. She described the suspect as having a foul odor.

Women in a village near the Wildlife SOS Elephant Conservation and Care Centre in the northern city of Mathura reportedly began producing the colourful, pyjama-like garments after staff at the centre warned temperatures were approaching sub-zero at night.

The conservation centre takes in rescued elephants who have previously suffered chronic neglect and beatings from cruel handlers.

The scientists at Germany’s BioNTech (BNTX) who helped develop a coronavirus jab with US pharma company Pfizer (PFE) have used the same technology to develop a vaccine which they say cures multiple sclerosis (MS) in mice.

Both use a piece of genetic material called mRNA that is injected into a person's arm and forces the body's cells to produce a protein that help against the respective diseases for which the jab has been developed.

In the case of COVID-19, if a person later contracts the disease, the immune system is able to quickly fight it by creating antibodies before the virus can spread.

BioNTech CEO Ugur Sahin led research showing that an mRNA vaccine might also work in multiple sclerosis, Fierce Biotech, a pharma news outlet, reported.

Sahin's team showed that an mRNA vaccine encoding a disease-related autoantigen successfully improved MS symptoms in sick animals and prevented disease progression in rodents showing early signs of MS.

Sahin, along with colleagues at BioNTech and scientists at the Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz, hypothesised that an mRNA vaccine could help the immune system tolerate specific MS-related proteins without compromising normal immune function.

WATCH: What is being suggested to help curb the spread of coronavirus?

READ MORE: UK approves BioNTech and Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine for use

With the MS vaccine, the mRNA technology stops the body's immune system from attacking neurons in the brain and spinal cord which can lead to the loss of bodily function.

Clinical trials on mice revealed the jab not only stopped the disease from progressing but restored some motor skills which had been lost.

The German startup has been at the forefront of the vaccine race.

It announced on Tuesday that it plans to supply an additional 700 million doses of its 19 COVID-10 vaccine thanks to a new factory in Germany and new European guidelines that allow for an extra shot to be extracted from each vial.

It, along with Pfizer, had originally pledged to make 1.3 billion doses in 2021 but now believes it can provide as many as 2 billion.

Story continues

Last month, the UK became the first western country to grant emergency authorisation of the COVID-19 vaccine it created.

Sahin has previously expressed confidence that its COVID-19 vaccine is effective against a new mutation of the disease that recently emerged out of the UK.

Earlier this year, BioNTech warned that there would be gaps in the supply of its vaccines until others are rolled out, as it continues to work with Pfizer to boost production.

The company has been slow to provide its shot in the European Union due to late approval from the bloc’s health regulator — the European Medicines Agency — and the small size of the order placed by Brussels.

Sahin told Germany’s Spiegel: “At the moment it doesn’t look good – a hole is appearing because there’s a lack of other approved vaccines and we have to fill the gap with our own vaccine.”

While the United States ordered some 600 million doses of the BioNTech/Pfizer shot in July last year, the EU placed an order for only half that size in November.

The UK ordered 40 million doses in total, enough to inoculate 20 million people, under a third of the total population of 67 million.

"When students were bullied because of dirty clothes, a principal installed a free laundromat at school","When students were bullied because of dirty clothes, a principal installed a free laundromat at school",1.0,"(CNN) The teenage girl screamed and fought with the school security officer when he tried to check her bag.

""The police later told me she had dirty clothes in her bag because she was homeless and didn't want anyone to know,"" Akbar Cook, the principal of West Side High School in Newark, New Jersey, told CNN. ""She was fighting for her pride.""

Cook said many students at West Side faced humiliation because they didn't have anything clean to wear.

So when school starts September 4, there will be a new facility in the building: a free laundromat.

Students pick out their favorite detergent in the new laundry room.

Shame keeps students away

Kids who could not afford to wash their clothes faced intense teasing when they showed up in dirty outfits. Classmates sometimes snapped photos and tagged the students on social media.

""I've seen a few kids in the back of the class talk about one of the people in front of the class and how they smelled and how their clothes looked dirty,"" student Nasirr Cameron told CNN affiliate WCBS.

Cook heard the students talking, too. He saw the posts and quickly suspected that the bullying was a top reason why 85% of his students chronically missed school.

""These are kids, good kids who want to learn, that are missing three to five days a month because they were being bullied because they were dirty,"" Cook explained to CNN. ""I even changed the school uniform to darker colors so they could go more days without cleaning them, but even with that, students were struggling to have them look clean enough to attend.""

So two years ago, the principal applied for a grant from a foundation associated with one of Newark's main utility companies, PSE&G. He received $20,000 to turn an old football locker room into a school laundromat.

A clean start to the school year

The renovations are now complete. The room has five washers, five dryers and a growing stock of detergent donated from around the country.

Student Rah-Asia Marrow stocks the shelves with donated laundry detergent for the student laundromat at West Side High School.

""As the story has spread, we have been receiving packages of detergent at the school and through our Amazon wish list page,"" Nicole Daniel, the school's operating assistant, told CNN.

School social worker Jamila Hammond told WCBS it feels good to know that they can help students who wanted to go to school but felt disgraced by their clothing.

""Many times the students may come in because they're embarrassed, they don't look the same, somebody's complaining about a body odor. I would say, 'OK, baby, then we're going to have to do it the old way.' We have soap, we have water. But now with this laundry room we don't have to do that,"" Daniel said.

The room is open to students free of charge between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. An adult supervisor keeps an eye out during those hours and helps pass on the important life skill of being self-reliant; one scoop of detergent and one measure of dignity at a time.

Principal Akbar Cook poses with a few of the graduating students of the West Side High School class of 2018.

""We are trying to teach them to navigate their pride,"" Cook said. ""My kids are fighters -- they just need good ways to fight for themselves, and then take pride in what they can do.""",https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2018/08/21/health/iyw-school-laundry-room-trnd/index.html
"By turning medical scans into adventures, GE eases children's fears",Children's Hospitals convert MRI and CT Scanners to interactive adventures to avoid frightening children.,1.0,"An MRI system at the University of California San Francisco Benioff Children's Hospital features a cable car theme. Credit: GE Healthcare

SHARE GE Healthcare industrial designers Erik Kemper (left) and Doug Dietz helped develop the idea of transforming the often-frightening process of MRI and CT scans into an adventure for children. Mark Hoffman

By of the

Waukesha — The sight of a terrified little girl about to have an MRI scan gave Doug Dietz a different perspective on his work as an industrial designer at GE Healthcare — and led to a project that has turned imaging departments at 27 children's hospitals into small theme parks.

The idea that eventually emerged from a mix of brainstorming and research — with some persistence thrown in — was to transform a frightening medical test into a voyage on a spaceship, a visit to a pirate island and other adventures.

Imaging departments became elaborate sets. Technicians became amateur actors with scripts. And children were given starring roles.

""Children would cling to their mom's leg and start crying, and you would have to pry them off,"" said Kathleen Kapsin, radiology director of Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, part of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. ""Now they walk in and they are excited.""

Imagine being a 6-year-old child about to be fed into the bore of a large, noisy machine and then being told not to move for 10 minutes, 30 minutes or longer.

That's what computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography — commonly known as CT, MRI and PET scans — entail.

Even some adults panic in MRIs with small bores, or openings.

Children often told the designers at GE Healthcare that the bore of the machine was the scariest part of the room.

""One of our designers said it looks like everything your mother told you stay away from,"" said Erik Kemper, also a designer.

Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh had to sedate almost every child younger than 9 who needed an MRI scan, Kapsin said, and more than 80% of the children who needed a CT scan.

An MRI scan typically lasts more than 30 minutes, a CT scan about 10 minutes.

Sedating a child meant calling an anesthesiologist and administering medication through an intravenous line.

Children would be terrified. Parents would be worried. And the hospital's expensive imaging equipment could do far fewer scans each day.

That was before the hospital worked with GE Healthcare to come up with what is now known as the Adventure Series.

Fewer than 27% of the children who needed MRIs and fewer than 3% of the children who needed CT scans had to be sedated in the fiscal year ended June, Kapsin said.

The genesis of the idea for the Adventure Series came from Dietz's visiting a children's hospital to see an MRI machine that he had helped design. During the visit, he saw a terrified girl clinging to her parents before a scan.

""It just broke my heart,"" Dietz said. ""It was just an awful experience.""

He remembers her parents catching each other's eyes.

""You could tell they didn't know what to do to help their daughter get through this experience,"" he said.

Dietz realized that he and the other industrial designers in Waukesha needed to use their skills to improve the patient's experience during imaging tests.

Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh — which had learned that finding ways to distract children lessened the need for sedation — was intrigued.

""There is nothing like one of your main customers telling you this is a great idea,"" Dietz said. ""Their timing was just perfect.""

Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh would become a key partner, with its interest making the project a priority.

The designers in Waukesha — one of GE Healthcare's five design studios worldwide — work in a large, open, somewhat disheveled room. It is a place where people still use pencils and occasionally even crayons.

The first brainstorming session took place at a day care center. Dietz made bag lunches for the designers. They then talked to doctors, staff at the Betty Brinn Children's Museum in Milwaukee and more children.

There was no one moment when someone came up with the idea for the Adventure Series. Instead, the idea gradually took shape.

Variety of themes

The series consists of a variety of themes for the different tests. For an MRI, it is a space voyage, with technicians telling children that the spaceship is about to go into hyper-drive when the machine becomes loud. For a PET scan, it is Camp Cozy, because children need to be calm and the test takes about 45 minutes.

GE Healthcare also has developed themes for specific hospitals. For a children's hospital in San Francisco, for example, it designed a theme around cable cars.

JWD-Creative, a Milwaukee ad agency, helped write the scripts and develop the artwork for the Adventure Series.

Part of the process is preparing kids for the scan, such as giving them coloring books tied to the theme the day before the test.

""We used the children's imagination to our advantage,"" said Kapsin of Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. ""Instead going to the CT scanner, you are going to Pirate Island. And when you go in, we have a monkey on a swing, so they can play with the monkey.""

GE Healthcare estimates that the Adventure Series costs $50,000 to $100,000 for each ""room"" with imaging equipment.

The biggest expense can be goggles without any metal parts that can work inside an MRI machine. The goggles, which cost about $40,000, enable a child to watch a DVD tied to the theme or one of his or her choice.

The cost can be more than offset, however, if a hospital can do more scans a day and doesn't have to buy another MRI or CT-PET scanner.

""The best way to keep a child motionless is to keep them engaged and entertained,"" Kapsin said.

The technicians at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh initially were skeptical of the idea. That quickly passed.

""We saw children excited and children happy instead of crying and upset,"" Kapsin said.

The technicians soon started getting into the role-playing, wearing scrubs that matched the theme and suggesting toys tied to the theme to give the children at the end of the scan.

The project now is cited as a model of innovation. Dietz has given TED talks on creativity and been featured in a book by Tom and David Kelley of IDEO, an international design firm in Palo Alto, Calif.

He also can tell a story about hearing a child asking her parents after a scan if they could do it again tomorrow.

""That probably was the biggest reward I could ever have,"" he said.",http://archive.jsonline.com/business/by-turning-medical-scans-into-adventures-ge-eases-childrens-fears-b99647870z1-366161191.html/
"Justice Ginsburg 'up and working' after breaking ribs, nephew says","SCJ Ruth B. Ginsburg out of hospital and ""doing great""",1.0,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is “up and working” and making jokes after being hospitalized with rib fractures, her nephew said on Thursday at the premiere of a new movie about her early career fighting for women’s equality.

FILE PHOTO: U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg participates in taking a new family photo with her fellow justices at the Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C., U.S., June 1, 2017. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo

Daniel Stiepleman, who wrote the script for the film “On the Basis of Sex” about his aunt’s work as a young lawyer, with input from the justice herself, told Reuters the 85-year-old Ginsburg was “doing great.”

“The last I heard she was up and working, of course, because what else would she be doing, and cracking jokes,” he said. “I can’t promise they were good jokes but they were jokes.”

Ginsburg was hospitalized in Washington after suffering three fractured ribs from a fall. Hours later, Hollywood got its first look at the new film about her pioneering work.

“On the Basis of Sex” stars Felicity Jones as a young Ginsburg and Armie Hammer as her tax attorney husband Martin, in a story about a landmark discrimination case the pair argued in 1972. Director Mimi Leder described the movie as the “origin story” of the justice, who became a hero among U.S. liberals.

“She is a woman who, like countless generations of women before her and since, withstood the subtle slights and overt discrimination of the culture around her,” Leder told the audience at the movie’s world premiere. “She is a woman who changed that culture with her.”

The film, which will debut in U.S. theaters in December on Christmas, depicts Ginsburg as one of just nine women at Harvard Law School in the 1950s, and later struggling to find a firm that will hire a Jewish woman as a lawyer.

“I wanted to show someone who, when they’re younger, didn’t have all the answers,” Jones told Reuters on the red carpet. “She was making mistakes, finding out who she was, had a very young family, her husband wasn’t very well.

“She was juggling a lot of difficult things at the same time,” Jones added, “but always (had) this absolute commitment to the law.”

The film chronicles a case involving Charles Moritz, a single man who was denied a $296 tax deduction because he was a male caregiver. Ginsburg and her husband successfully argued that the denial represented gender-based discrimination.

The new grants will offer $20 million to more than 100 organizations supporting such causes as wildlife and habitat conservation and climate programs.

DiCaprio announced the grants at a climate change conference at Yale University hosted by John Kerry. “We are proud to support the work of over 100 organizations at home and abroad,” DiCaprio said. “These grantees are active on the ground, protecting our oceans, forests and endangered species for future generations — and tackling the urgent, existential challenges of climate change.”

The Oscar-winning actor went on to push for urgent action to shift from fossil fuel reliance to renewable energy. “There exist today many proven technologies in renewable energy, clean transportation and sustainable agriculture, that we can begin to build a brighter future for all of us,” he said. “Our challenge is to find new ways to power our lives, employ millions of people and turn every individual into an advocate for clean air and drinkable water. We must demand that politicians accept climate science and make bold commitments before it is too late.”

Said Terry Tamminen, CEO of the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation: “This round of grants comes at a critical time. With a lack of political leadership and continued evidence that climate change is growing worse with record-breaking heatwaves and storms, we believe we need to do as much as we can now, before it is too late.”

We’ve officially annihilated a second strain of polio. Only one remains,We’ve officially annihilated a second strain of polio. Only one remains,1.0,"A crippling strain of polio virus is no more. Officials confirmed Thursday that global health efforts have wiped it out, moving humanity one step closer to completely eradicating the highly infectious virus from the planet.

The obliterated strain—wild poliovirus type 3 (WPV3)—is one of only three wild strains of polio. It is the second to be globally eradicated. Health officials declared WPV2 eradicated in 2015. That leaves only one wild strain remaining: WPV1.

This “historic” announcement falls on World Polio Day and is based on the recent conclusion of the independent Global Commission for the Certification of Poliomyelitis Eradication, set up in part by the World Health Organization. The announcement comes after years of careful and painstaking global surveillance to certify that WPV3 no longer exists anywhere in the world, apart from specimens preserved in secure containment. The last known case of WPV3 occurred in northern Nigeria in 2012.

“Wild poliovirus type 3 is globally eradicated,” commission chair and vaccine expert David Salisbury declared at a celebration at WHO headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. “This is a significant achievement that should reinvigorate the eradication process and provides motivation for the final step—the eradication of wild poliovirus type 1.”

That final step is not expected to be an easy one. Currently, WPV1 only circulates in two countries: Afghanistan and Pakistan. But vaccination efforts to stop it are plagued by vaccine misinformation and harmful rumors, armed conflicts and insecurity, and fears and misinformation about vaccine-derived polio infections, which are rare but a considerable threat.

Endgame

Polio viruses in general spread via the fecal-oral route, therefore thriving in areas with poor sanitation and low, to no, vaccination. The virus typically affects young children and can cause permanent paralysis and even death in a small number of those infected. Some people infected will have no symptoms, though, making surveillance particularly difficult.

Oral polio vaccines use weakened versions of the virus to train the immune system to fight the devastating disease. Thus, those vaccinated can harbor these weakened viruses in their guts for a short period of time, excreting them in waste. In under-immunized populations with poor sanitation, the weakened viruses can circulate and spread just like the three wild strains.

In rare instances when the weakened strains are able to circulate for extended periods of time (at least 12 months), they can mutate and collect dangerous traits from other circulating viruses, creating hybrid viruses that can, once again, cause paralysis. These cases are called circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV). In well-immunized populations, cVDPVs are not an issue.

In past years, there have been over two-dozen outbreaks of cVDPV in at least 21 countries. So far in 2019, there have been 94 cases of WPV1 (in Afghanistan and Pakistan) and 102 cases of cVDPV worldwide.

The jaw-dropping story behind an NFL coach's search for his family,"Kansas City Chiefs running backs coach, adopted at birth, discovers biological father is his life long mentor.",1.0,"Runs in the Family Kansas City Chiefs running backs coach Deland McCullough went searching for his biological parents. He found them where he never would have expected. E:60 by Sarah Spain Illustration by Jonathan Bartlett for ESPN 09/02/18

Carol Briggs placed her newborn son on the bed and removed all of his clothes. She tried to find herself in his face, searching his mouth, his nose, his eyes. ""Not yet,"" she thought. She saw only his father. She looked him up and down, making a mental note of each of his 10 tiny toes, chubby legs, puffy belly and two little arms reaching up at her. ""In my mind,"" Briggs says, ""that was probably going to be the last time I ever saw him."" It was Dec. 1, 1972, and a big snowstorm had hit the greater Pittsburgh area that week. Briggs had gone sledding with some of the other girls the night before, dragging a cardboard box up and down a big hill that emptied out right at the Zoar Home for Mothers, Babies and Convalescents in Allison Park, Pennsylvania. She woke up in labor around 2 a.m., and just 32 minutes later, she was a mother. She named her baby Jon Kenneth Briggs. Her parents and older brother drove the hour from her hometown of Youngstown, Ohio, to be with her at the hospital. After cleaning out her room at the maternity home and signing some papers, she was back in Ohio the next day, ready to resume her life as a 16-year-old high schooler and National Honor Society member. No one outside of her immediate family and her cousin Robin knew about the baby. Only when she was preparing to sign the adoption papers did Briggs consider sharing the news with the father, a teenage fling who had gone off to college before she discovered she was pregnant. She ultimately decided against it. ""He was a kid too,"" she says. ""He was off at college on a scholarship. I think I may have felt that I kind of got myself in this, I'm gonna do what I need to do to work my way through it."" With her parents' blessing, Briggs had decided that when the child was born, she would put him up for adoption. ""My mother was still cleaning up my room for me once a week,"" she says. ""I wasn't in a position to be anybody's mother. I thought this was best for him, that I allow him to be placed with some family that would be able to give him all the great things that I had coming up because I had a mother and a father. I just didn't want him to get cheated out of anything."" In her last interaction with the adoption agency, Briggs was told that baby Jon had been placed with a doctor and his wife in Columbus, Ohio. IN EARLY 2017, now-Kansas City Chiefs running backs coach Deland McCullough signed on to coach the running backs at USC, having spent the previous six years in the same position at Indiana University. A few months before making the move to southern California, he and his wife, Darnell, welcomed their fourth son into the world. For the fourth time, the couple provided doctors with Darnell's medical history but couldn't do the same for Deland's side of the family. At 44 years old, McCullough knew nothing about where he came from. Growing up in Youngstown, his adoptive mother, Adelle Comer, could tell him only that he was adopted at a very young age and that she had no information about his birth parents. For a long time, that was enough. McCullough wasn't interested in finding them anyway. There was enough trouble in Youngstown those days, and he didn't want to burden anyone who might have bigger things to worry about. Things changed when he had his first child, and as his family grew, so too did his desire to know of his past. He wanted to know who gave him his deep voice and his muscular build and to whom he owed his pensive nature and quiet intensity. He wondered where son Dason got his height and which grandfather or uncle his bespectacled son, Daeh, might favor. He was so hungry for information that he never questioned whether the search might lead him to answers he couldn't handle. ""I didn't know what was going to happen,"" McCullough says. ""I didn't know how people would receive things one way or another. I didn't have a plan. I just knew I wanted to find out."" New laws in Ohio and Pennsylvania had called for the unsealing of adoption records, giving McCullough new hope that he might find his birth parents. In November 2017, more than a year after filling out the requisite paperwork and years after his search began, he finally received his adoption files in the mail. For the first time, he saw his original birth certificate, complete with his name, Jon Kenneth Briggs, and the name of his mother, Carol Denise Briggs. There was no information about his father. ADELLE COMER WAS living in a three-bedroom house on a cul-de-sac in Youngstown with her husband, popular local radio host A.C. McCullough, and their young son, Damon, when she got the call. It was a social worker reaching out to see whether she and A.C. would come see an infant at an adoption agency in Pennsylvania. Not long after the tragic death of their second son, Alex, who died of an intestinal birth defect after just 28 days, the young couple had started serving as foster parents, and they were looking to adopt. In January 1973, they met 6-week-old baby Jon. ""He was asleep in a bassinet,"" Comer says. ""And she put him in my arms, and when he woke up, his eyes were looking straight at me. It was instant connection. Love. Mother-son."" By March of that year, Jon Kenneth Briggs had been renamed Deland Scott McCullough, and he was living at home with his new parents, Adelle and A.C. ""We were still in love, a good couple,"" Comer says. ""We went to church, partied, went to cookouts. We were working together and doing this together and wanting to make a home for our children. We knew that God's hand was in it. Deland came so fast to us. We knew that it was meant to be. Both of us."" But things changed quickly. Comer's father had a stroke, and though A.C. wanted to put him in a nursing home, Comer brought her dad to live with the family in Youngstown. Their marriage deteriorated, and when Deland was just 2 years old, A.C. moved out. ""They went through a lot of hurt and disappointment, but they took it,"" Comer says of her sons. ""I said, 'God gives you an example of what to be and what not to be. You have to make the choice.' And that's all I had to say, and they got it."" When Deland was in elementary school, Comer came home to find that he had cut three gashes into the couch for which she had just finished two years of layaway payments. Kids at school had been teasing him about being adopted, and he accused Comer of loving him less than her birth son, Damon. She explained that she loved the two boys differently, one because he had been in her belly and the other because she had chosen him. After that, Deland McCullough rarely spoke of his adoption. He got good at pretending to be whole. ""The void was there,"" he says. ""I wish that it wasn't, but I think I did a good job of hiding it."" After the divorce, Comer had relationships with a few other men, some of whom were combative and abusive. ""Some men don't understand what respect is,"" she says. ""I've got two sons, and I'm not gonna allow my children to grow up with this type of lifestyle, this drama."" Damon sometimes tried to physically defend her, but then he left for college, and Deland felt too small, physically and emotionally, to step in. His response to the violence was to try to tune it out, become emotionless, put blinders on and dream of a way out of the house and out of Youngstown. Comer acknowledges that she contributed to the chaos in her own way as well. ""Biggest drama queen in the world, OK?"" she says. ""They called me Ma Barker because I'd shoot you and ask questions later."" Comer took Deland with her to therapy for a while, hoping to make things at home a little less turbulent. New boyfriends came and went, but she mostly settled into life as a single mom, taking on multiple jobs to support her sons, including as a switchboard operator at the Cuyahoga County Department of Human Services, a waitress, a social worker and a short-order cook at the local bowling alley. She did her best to rear the boys on her own, but they moved a lot, and she struggled to pay the bills, sometimes having to choose between electricity and a working phone. But Comer stressed the importance of an education, insisting that she see the boys' homework to make sure they were taking it seriously. She taught them the value of a dollar and the importance of faith, demanding that they use a portion of their monthly child support for Sunday school and tithes at church. And she was always shuttling them to activities, from the theater program at the Youngstown Playhouse to football, basketball and track practices. Deland was a bit of a late bloomer in terms of talent, but the passion for football was always there. Early on in pee wee, he heard his name over the loudspeaker and a light went off in his head. He fell in love with the game and started carrying a football with him everywhere he went, even to bed. ""It was an escape,"" he says. ""When I was out there practicing, you didn't think about the electric is off, you know? You didn't even think about anything like that. You were just out there balling, doing your thing and competing and bonding with your friends."" Comer was a one-woman cheer squad, bringing multiple signs to Deland's games and running up and down the sideline rooting him on. One night when her ride didn't show up, she took her son's moped to the game. He looked up in the stands and saw her, still wearing his moped helmet, hollering and screaming for him: ""D-MACK! D-MACK!"" As a junior defensive back, Deland saw himself playing football at a small school or enlisting in the Navy, but an opportunity to show his talent at the running back position his senior year drew the eye of college recruiters. Suddenly, he was being pursued by the likes of Jim Tressel, then the head coach at Youngstown State; Bob Stoops, then the defensive backs coach at Kansas State; and Sherman Smith, then the running backs coach at Miami of Ohio. DELAND MCCULLOUGH LOOKED out the window of his third-period English class at Campbell Memorial High School and saw a tall man emerge from a candy apple red Mercedes-Benz with tan interior and tricked-out gold rims. A few minutes later, he got a pink slip message to leave class and go to the office, where the tall man stuck out his hand and said, with a firm handshake, ""I'm Sherman Smith, the running backs coach at Miami University."" A former star quarterback at Miami, Smith was a second-round draft pick at running back for the Seahawks and went on to play eight years in the NFL. He had a booming voice, thick arms and broad, square shoulders. He walked and talked and carried himself like a former pro; McCullough was immediately drawn to him. ""It was just something about his personality,"" McCullough says. ""The way he presented himself. He had things that I hadn't seen out of a man or mentor. He was on top of his details. He was successful. He had played in the NFL. He got his degree. I wasn't around that type of person. ""The Mercedes was nice, too, you know?"" he laughed. ""That was slick."" As a Youngstown native himself, Smith thought guys from the area were tough, but the coaches told him McCullough was special -- a thin kid, but when he couldn't run around people, he'd go through them. McCullough was serious that day in the office, offering few smiles and answering with a lot of ""Yes, sir"" and ""No, sir,"" but he was also intelligent and expressive. Smith thought he'd very much like to work with him. The feeling was mutual. Despite interest from other schools, the decision to attend Miami University was easy for McCullough, especially after the home visit, during which Smith charmed Comer as well. ""Well, Coach Smith was hard not to love,"" Comer says, laughing. ""I fell in love with him the first time. He was just a gentleman. And he was very attentive and respectful to me."" Smith drove them to visit the school and was back at Campbell Memorial a few months later for signing day, when McCullough signed his letter of intent to play at Miami. When McCullough arrived on campus, the coaches tried to turn him into a wide receiver, but he pushed for an opportunity to work with Smith and the running backs, accepting a redshirt freshman year to pursue the position he believed he was meant to play. ""I would tell the players, 'You may not be looking for a father, but I'm going to treat you like you're my sons,'"" Smith says. ""And so I just looked at every guy like my son. I just wanted to be a positive role model for Deland and exemplify what I thought my father exemplified for me."" ""He was everything,"" McCullough says. ""If anything was going on, I was going to talk to Coach Smith. Everybody in that room gravitated towards Coach Smith just because that's the type of person he was. What he's about rubs off on you, so I always wanted to be around that."" Smith left Miami University after that season to be the tight ends coach at the University of Illinois, but he and McCullough stayed in touch. He watched from afar as McCullough put together a Hall of Fame career in Oxford, rushing 36 touchdowns and setting a school record with 4,368 rushing yards. McCullough was surprised when his name wasn't called in the 1996 draft, but he was invited to a few workouts and ended up signing with the Bengals. He was leading the NFL in preseason rushing before he suffered a season-ending knee injury in Cincinnati's final exhibition game. After a few more looks in the NFL, a couple of seasons in Canada, several more knee surgeries and a brief flirtation with the XFL, McCullough finally accepted in 2001 that the dream of pro football was over. A few years later, married and the father of one son, McCullough took a job teaching communications and coaching football at Harmony Community School in Cincinnati. Despite rising to the ranks of principal and making a good salary, his first taste of coaching gave him the itch to coach full time, and he reached out to his alma mater about an opportunity to join the staff. Smith had followed a similar path, first teaching and coaching high schoolers, then working his way up the ranks from Miami University to the University of Illinois, the Houston Oilers, the Washington Redskins and, finally, the running backs coach for the Seahawks. He was with Seattle when he got a call from McCullough, asking for advice as he started his new job at Miami University. By 2014, McCullough was coaching at Indiana University, and the two were reunited on the field, as Smith welcomed McCullough to Seattle for a coaching internship. He saw firsthand that his former player had a real future on the sideline. He had no idea that off the field, McCullough was consumed by the search for his family. A FEW DAYS before Thanksgiving 2017, Carol Briggs got home from work, sat down on the couch and opened a Facebook message from an unfamiliar man: ""Did you have a baby in 1972 in Allegheny County that you placed for adoption?"" ""Luckily, I was already sitting,"" she says. Briggs had thought often of baby Jon. Every year, she wished him a ""Happy Birthday"" on her Facebook wall, and she regularly searched adoption websites to see if he might be looking for her. Briggs could still hear her mother's voice, saying more and more often in the years before she died, ""You need to find that boy."" Never married and without any other children, Briggs would joke to her cousin Robin that one day baby Jon might show up at her door and walk in to find her home alone, dancing around the house to Funkadelic. She called her older brother, who warned her that the message might be from someone trying to bribe or extort her. She responded anyway, and after a few short messages, she agreed to speak to McCullough on the phone that night after he got out of practice. In the hours before the call, she Googled his name and read every article she could find. She stared at his pictures and tried to find herself in his face. It wasn't hard to see it now: the mouth, the nose, the eyes. McCullough called Briggs from a hallway at USC as he awaited the start of a football family dinner. They spoke as if they'd known each other for years, an easy back and forth as they shared where life had taken them in the 44 years since she'd laid him down on that bed and let him go. She learned that he had never gone to live with a doctor in Columbus, that in fact they had been just a few miles away from each other in Youngstown for all of McCullough's childhood. She likely shopped at the same grocery store as Adelle Comer, perhaps even passing young McCullough in the aisles. She was certain that her sports-fanatic father, now deceased, had read about McCullough's high school exploits in the paper. McCullough was overjoyed to find his birth mother, though a mother had never been what he was missing. ""Within probably the first five or six minutes, he says, 'Who is my father?'"" Briggs says. She took a breath. She had probably told only three people the man's name. After making the decision to not tell the father all those years ago, she had been determined to never let him learn of the baby years later because of careless gossip. She hesitated but decided McCullough had a right to know. ""Your father's name is Sherman Smith,"" Briggs told him. McCullough, leaning against a wall in the hallway, felt as though he might pass out. He started flashing back to all of his memories with Smith and all the times people had joked about him being a carbon copy of his coach. Throughout college, when he returned to coach at Miami University, during his internship with the Seahawks. ""'Man, you and Coach Smith look alike.' 'Man, you all walk alike.' 'Y'all this, y'all this,'"" McCullough says. ""There's no reason to connect those dots because you weren't even thinking about them. A sense of pride that went through me, like, 'Wow, that explains these things.' And then I also start thinking about all the similarities of our path. That just blew me away."" Not only had he known his father for 28 years, but Smith was also his mentor, the man he had looked up to since he was 16 years old. McCullough thought of a photo of him and Smith at Campbell Memorial High, both beaming as he signed his letter of intent to play at Miami University. The same photo he had pinned to the corkboard that hung in his college dorm room. The same photo that was at that moment sitting in a Ziploc bag in the drawer of his nightside table, a bag that had traveled with him through every job and every move. ""If you would have told me to pick who my father was, there's no way I would have picked him because I might have thought I wasn't worthy for him to be my father,"" McCullough says. ""I felt like my blessings came full circle because I'd always wanted to be somebody like him."" ""I could hear him take a big breath,"" Briggs says. ""And I could kind of hear him choke up a little. And finally he says, 'Well, I've known Sherman my whole life.'"" THE NEXT MORNING, McCullough texted Smith asking if they could talk about something important. It was November, and Smith assumed that McCullough had gotten a coaching opportunity he wanted to discuss. Instead, McCullough began by talking about his search for his birth parents, how he had found his biological mother, and she was from Youngstown, just like them. ""Praise the Lord!"" Smith recalls saying. ""What a blessing!"" ""And then he said, 'I asked her who my biological father was, and she said you.'"" Smith was quiet. Sixty-three years old, he had been married to his college sweetheart for 42 years and had reared a grown son and a daughter. He hadn't heard the name Carol Briggs in more than four decades. He never knew she was pregnant, never knew there was a baby. He knew he couldn't deny the possibility that he was McCullough's father, but he wanted proof. Even more, he wanted time to think. He asked McCullough if he could call him back later. Stunned and a little hurt, McCullough agreed. Smith sat in his office. Guilt washed over him. Even though he hadn't been told about the baby, he couldn't shake the feeling that he had let Briggs and McCullough down. He felt awful that he had left Briggs in such a difficult position and regretted all the years he had missed out on being a father to McCullough. He had built a life making a difference in young men's lives. He had spoken to his athletes and his kids about being responsible, being accountable. ""Being irresponsible is not neutral,"" Smith says. ""When you're irresponsible, someone becomes responsible for what you've been irresponsible for."" He thought about what this would say about him as a man and found himself hoping that a paternity test would show that he wasn't McCullough's father. It was a thought that brought him only more guilt. He asked to speak to Briggs. Briggs cried her way through work the day she was set to talk to Smith. ""I hadn't talked to Sherman in 45 years. And after 45 years, this is probably not the icebreaker conversation that you want to have with the guy that you used to fool around with. 'Hey, we've got a 45-year-old son. And how are you?' So, no, I wasn't looking forward to that at all. Not at all."" There was no need to worry. Smith was calm and kind, and the two settled into a nice conversation, catching up for a long time before they even got to talking about McCullough. Smith apologized to her for her having to make such a difficult decision at such a young age, and Briggs explained why she had felt it was best to not tell Smith about the baby. She said that over the years, she just wanted to know that McCullough was OK, and Smith reassured her that her son was a good man. Briggs hung up full of emotion but relieved that Smith wasn't angry with her. Smith hung up feeling much more certain that McCullough was his son. Smith talked to his wife, Sharon, and his brother, Vincent. He talked to his children, Sherman and Shavonne. He thought about McCullough's coaching internship a few years earlier, how Seahawks assistant offensive line coach Pat Ruel hadn't stopped cracking jokes about Smith and his protege acting like a father-son duo. McCullough sent Smith an old article from his days in the CFL, and Smith couldn't believe his eyes. ""I'm looking at this thing and thinking, 'I don't remember taking this picture. I don't remember doing this article,'"" Smith says. ""I'm looking at Deland, and I'm thinking it's me. That got me. ""I called my aunt in Youngstown, and I told her about it. And she'd went on YouTube and pulled up some pictures of Deland, and she called me back. She said, 'Nephew, I can save you the money on the DNA tests.'"" The more Smith thought about it, the more he realized the story wasn't about him and his guilt. It was about McCullough and what he had been through. It was about a life without a father, about the years McCullough had spent looking for his birth parents, hoping to fill a void, wanting to know where he'd come from. ""It was said that humility is not thinking less of yourself, it's thinking of yourself less,"" Smith says. ""I started thinking about Deland."" Sometime in the weeks between that first phone call and the test results, Smith realized that he was hoping he was McCullough's father. That, in fact, he would be devastated if the results came back otherwise. When the test came in, it showed a 99.99 percent chance that Smith was, indeed, McCullough's father. Both were elated. ""I look at it, and I just say it's a God thing,"" Smith says. ""It's grace. It's undeserved. And that's what's made it great for Deland and for all of us, how everyone has embraced this and is excited about our new family."" McCullough understood why Smith had been so curt at first. McCullough had spent his whole life wondering about his birth parents. Briggs had spent her whole life wondering about her child. Smith had gone from zero to a 45-year-old son in one phone call; he needed time. Deland McCullough gathered with his biological parents, his adoptive mother and his extended family at a reunion in July. Ruddy Roye for ESPN A few weeks after the paternity test came back, McCullough had a recruiting trip near Nashville, where Smith and his wife had relocated after his retirement. McCullough made a special trip to see the man he now knew as his father. ""I'm pretty sure he was nervous,"" Smith says of that day. ""I laugh because I'm looking out the window because I know he's supposed to be coming. I'm standing there, and I see he parks at the corner down there. And he's parked there for five minutes. I said, 'What's he doing?' He finally pulls up and gets out the car."" As McCullough walked up the steps to the house, Smith greeted him with open arms and said, ""My son."" It was the first time in McCullough's life that anyone had called him that. ""For so many years that I was around him, the embrace was, 'Hey, Coach, how you doing?'"" Smith says. ""But this is, 'Man, my son.' Maybe I was doing it for me, to help me really, fully understand."" ""I know he was saying it from a place of 'I'm proud. This is my son,'"" McCullough says. ""I'd never heard that. I'd never been referred to like that before -- period. It really hit me hard emotionally. When I sit here at this point, and I'm looking at the things that I've done, I'm happy that I'm able to be somebody that he's proud of."" At first, McCullough was concerned that his adoptive mother might be upset by his relationships with his birth parents. But as soon as he heard that Briggs and Comer had hit it off in their first phone call, he knew everything would be fine. ""All I can say is, 'Are you serious?' Over and over again. 'Are you serious?'"" Comer says of McCullough's journey leading to Smith. ""It's just a miracle that his birth father's been in his life since he was 16, 17 years old. That's my son, and I want nothing but 100 percent best for him. He needed that, and God gave it to him, and it's in God's time."" Both Smith and Briggs are endlessly grateful to Comer for raising McCullough with the wisdom they didn't yet have. ""She did what I couldn't do,"" Briggs says of Comer. ""She was an adult, she was married at the time, so you know she brought him into a family structure. That was what I wanted for him. I wanted him to have what I had, and she gave him that. She gave him all the tools that he needed in growing up to be the successful man that he is right now."" THIS PAST JUNE, the two Miami University Hall of Famers, Smith and McCullough, were back on campus to witness the verbal commitment of McCullough's son, Deland McCullough II, to the RedHawks football team. The younger McCullough is a defensive back, just like Smith's son, Sherman, who played the position at Miami as well. In July, a huge family reunion in Youngstown brought McCullough, Briggs, Smith and Comer together for the first time. All of McCullough's parents in one place, reflecting on nurture versus nature, what is inherited versus what is taught and the many different forms of parenthood. It was both the culmination of a journey and the start of something new for the families that the journey had introduced. A man found his parents, a mother found her child, and a father discovered a son he never knew he was missing. There is no jealousy, no resentment and no regret. There is just gratitude for the winding paths that brought them all together. ""When I look at Deland, the type of guy he is, it was a gift to us,"" Smith says. ""And to think -- Deland felt we were a gift to him."" ""Now I know who I am and where I'm from,"" McCullough says. ""I got all of the pieces to the story. I got them all now.""

Men in Surrey treatment and recovery centre learn how to knit together “It’s like the one thing I can’t cheat, manipulate, cut corners, find loopholes. I have to follow each peg one at a time. It’s kind of like a routine of how I want to live my life from here on out.” — Nelson Mendonca on looming Photo by RICHARD LAM / PNG

Article content Nelson Mendonca is knitting his life together one stitch at a time. Technically, what Mendonca and a group of men at the Phoenix Society are doing isn’t knitting since it doesn’t involve traditional knitting needles. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

Try refreshing your browser, or Men in Surrey treatment and recovery centre learn how to knit together Back to video Instead, they use a loom to knit yarn together. It’s called looming. “At first I thought, ‘People are going to think I’m weird or whatever,’” Mendonca said. “Once I started knitting in public, I didn’t really care what people think. I enjoy doing it and I’m going to do it.” Far from being ostracized, Mendonca has created a new activity at the treatment and recovery centre which helps women and men break the cycle of addiction and homelessness. As many as 10 men at a time are now looming. They’ve made about 200 toques, which have ended up as gifts to loved ones and as donations to a women’s recovery house. They want other toques to go to the homeless and to babies in hospital once the pandemic is over.

Article content They call themselves “toquers.” “A lot of people were curious and wanted me to teach them how to loom,” Mendonca said. “It spread like wildfire around here.” Phoenix Centre, located across from Surrey Memorial Hospital, has 140 men and women who are going through recovery at a time: 60 are in treatment and 80 in transitional housing. Mendonca, 41, has passed through 100 days of addiction treatment and now lives in his own suite. He started looming after being taught by Miss B in Surrey Pretrial, a high security remand detention centre. When he arrived at Phoenix, he felt anxious so he started knitting toques again to keep his hands occupied. Now men at the treatment centre are looming at Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and while watching football on television and attending group sessions with counsellors. “It helps them open up to be focused on something: you’re not thinking about what you’re saying,” he said. “It makes it easier for them to open up and dig deep about certain things.” Photo by RICHARD LAM / PNG They use whatever yarn is around and make up designs on the go. Phoenix has helped with yarn and looms. They’ve also received donations from the public. Mendonca can make a toque in about an hour. The group has started expanding into scarves and plan to try socks. They’ve started making pompons, although there’s a big debate about whether toques should include pompons at all. Some guys have gone so far as to make toques with two pompons. Mendonca said he finds looming therapeutic and peaceful.

Article content “It’s like the one thing I can’t cheat, manipulate, cut corners, find loopholes,” he said “I have to follow each peg one at a time. It’s kind of like a routine of how I want to live my life from here on out.” Keir Macdonald, Phoenix Society chief executive officer, said he’s never seen a knitting group at Phoenix like the one started by Mendonca. Macdonald said the pandemic has changed recreational programs and activities at Phoenix which has led to more down time at the centre. “This was how Nelson passed his time,” he said. “It was a bit cathartic for him and he enjoyed it. It just took off. I think it’s reflective of many others who were looking for something to provide that sense of engagement, community, purpose.” Macdonald acknowledged the high number of overdose deaths in B.C. but also said Phoenix has seen “some amazing success this year that bucks the trend. “What are some of the most pleasing stats for us is that we’re seeing 60 to 70 per cent moving to market housing at the end of that program,” he said. “People are getting employed, people are going back to school and stabilizing.” kevingriffin@postmedia.com

Robyn Fenty a.k.a. Rihanna is truly the gift that keeps on giving. First, her Clara Lionel Foundation donates $5 million to myriad charities to fight COVID-19 relief on March 22. She then follows that up by donating PPE to the city of New York, receiving a personal thank you from half of the nation’s favorite sibling vaudeville act, governor of New York Andrew Cuomo. Just last week, CLF and Jay-Z’s Shawn Carter Foundation joined forces to offer $2 million in grants to support COVID-19 response efforts to support undocumented workers, the children of frontline health workers and first responders, and incarcerated, elderly, and homeless populations in New York City and Los Angeles. And now, CLF has teamed up with Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey to donate $2.1 million each to the Mayor’s Fund for Los Angeles to assist victims of domestic violence affected by the COVID-19 “stay at home” order in the greater Los Angeles area.

The $4.2 million donation will support ten weeks of support including shelter, meals, and counseling for individuals and their children suffering from domestic violence at a time when shelters are full and incidents are on the rise. In a statement, Rihanna, a domestic-abuse survivor, and Dorsey note that while they are starting in Los Angeles they understand that “victims of domestic violence exist all over the world, so this is just the beginning.” Major props to Dorsey; Rihanna; Rihanna’s father, Ronald Fenty, who is currently recovering from COVID-19; and Rihanna’s mother, Monica Braithewaite, for raising such a genuinely good individual.",https://www.vulture.com/2020/04/rihanna-jack-dorsey-donate-usd4-2-million-coronavirus-victims.html
Financial hurdle gone: Alberta first province to eliminate fees for addiction recovery programs,Financial hurdle gone: Alberta first province to eliminate fees for addiction recovery programs,1.0,"After 28 years sober, he lost his house, all his savings and sold all the equipment he owned to pay for alcohol.

Then, Lloydminster senior Bryan Robinson was staring down a $1,800 bill for a 45-day addiction recovery program.

His son came to his aid, paying the tab for his time at the Thorpe Recovery Centre.

""I knew I had to get well,"" he said in an interview on Friday. ""I knew I had to get better.""

Now in a long-term program at Our House Addiction Recovery Centre in west Edmonton, he's been paying $1,200 a month from his old age security and Canadian Pension Plan benefits.

But this month and beyond, his bill will be $0.

That's due to a major shift in the way the Alberta government is funding addictions recovery. For the first time, the province has eliminated fees for people to attend the 72 licensed, publicly funded treatment centres in the province.

The $40 daily cost for room and board will be covered for everyone who does not have health insurance plans that would cover the cost.

Associate Minister of Mental Health and Addictions, Jason Luan, said it's been a goal of his team since the United Conservative Party took office.

""I think we are contributing to a transformational change in the sector,"" he said. ""I wouldn't mind to say our major step forward, this milestone, will signal another best practice that we hope will lead the country with our numbers, with our evidence.""

Luan said families shouldn't have to sell a vehicle or refinance a mortgage to pay for addictions treatment programs. The cost was a huge hurdle, and one he wanted to eliminate.

Associate Minister of Mental Health and Addictions Jason Luan says eliminating user fees for residential addiction recovery programs is good value for money. (CBC)

He said it's also good economics. A 2018 report estimated substance use cost Alberta $5.5 billion in 2014 to pay for health services, police, court and corrections costs and in lost productivity. Every dollar invested in prevention can save another $12 down the road, he said.

His staff calculate the cost at about $8.2 million a year. About $5 million of that will be diverted from the department of Community and Social Services. People who qualified for income support or Assured Income for the Severely Handicapped (AISH) already had their recovery treatment costs covered by the government.

Although about 2,700 people in those programs entered recovery each year, many people whose lives were in crisis didn't qualify for the help. Seniors, post-secondary students and the working poor were left out.

The point of the policy change is to divert people to recovery programs before they lose everything.

Expanding service key part of plan

The loss isn't limited to the person snared by addiction. Lerena Greig helps their families. Executive director of Parents Empowering Parents Society, Greig has seen families spend their life savings to pay for addiction treatment programs.

Sometimes, if a person relapses, they may go through detox and treatment two, three or four times.

She's watched parents' mental and physical health deteriorate while they carry the stress. Some have remortgaged their homes to pay. She's seen the financial and emotional pressure lead to divorces.

She said she's ecstatic the financial barrier has been removed. That's because the largest barrier to recovery is often the willingness of the person to enter treatment at all.

""With addiction, it's kind of like there's a moment of clarity,"" she said. ""And if you don't jump on that moment of clarity when that person decides they want help, that moment is gone.""

With financial barriers gone, will there be enough treatment beds to take patients in their moments of clarity?

The government has been working on that. Luan has pledged to add 4,000 treatment ""spaces"" over four years, bringing the total to more than 12,000 across Alberta. A ""space"" is a bed and staffing to treat patients for one year, but most programs are far shorter.

It's also unclear how successful recovery programs are in the long-term — the government hopes to begin tracking that.

The funding changes could also bring more stability to recovery centres, which are either non-profit or run by Alberta Health Services.

Steven Archambault, director of community engagement and fund development for Simon House Recovery Centre in Calgary, said the 84-bed facility is heavily dependent on community donations.

Rather than receiving funding per patient, centres will now bid on three-year contracts determined by their services and capacity. That could make funding more predictable and allow them to expand their offerings, Archambault said.

He said the changes are exciting.

""Ideally, in the long run, we hope that the recognition will bring a much better opportunity of lowering the stigma that is attached to addiction throughout the country.""

Back in Edmonton, Robinson says saving up his pension earnings is a good first step to preparing for his eventual independence — whatever it looks like.

""Eventually, sooner or later, I've got to start, right? And it takes money to start. Or I'll be back to square one again.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/financial-hurdle-gone-alberta-first-province-to-eliminate-fees-for-addiction-recovery-programs-1.5793854

Taco truck operators showed up some schools to provide teachers with food.

“It’s L.A. What else are you going to bring?” Victor Fernandez said. “It’s tacos. Nobody hates tacos.”

About 50 people picketed outside the Ramon C. Cortines School of Visual and Performing Arts.

Among them were husband and wife Tirsa and Steve Farah, who had a cart offering free coffee and conchas to picketers.

Tirsa said her mother has been a teacher at Garfield High School for 30 years now. They chose this location because it was near her business, Tirsa’s Mexican Café.

“I couldn’t not do it,” Tirsa, 33, said of being out at the protest. “This is history in the making.”

Her family is full of educators. She wore red lipstick, a red bandana and red apron in support of the strike. Tomorrow, she said she plans on joining her mother at Garfield High to offer treats and coffee to the early morning picketers.

“They’re the heroes,” she said of the teachers.

No new cases of Covid-19 in New Zealand for second day running,Zero new cases in New Zealand for a second day in a row,1.0,"There have been no new cases of Covid-19 reported in New Zealand today for the second day in a row, the Health Ministry has confirmed.

Watch the latest briefing here:

The total number of confirmed and probable cases remains at 1497, of which 1147 have been confirmed.

Director-General of Health Dr Ashley Bloomfield said 1402 people have now recovered - up 12 on yesterday, and 94 percent of all cases in this country have now recovered.

There are still just two people receiving hospital-level care, neither are in ICU.

He said 5961 were carried out yesterday and there had now been more than 200,000 tests carried out.

""This milestone of 200,000 tests, which is just over 4 percent of the population, is a significant achievement. I want to recognise everybody who has been tested, as well as the many, many people across the system who have facilitated that happening, it is an incredibly important pillar of our response to Covid-19.""

Dr Bloomfield said today's figures did reinforce that New Zealand was ""on the right path"".

""We can't afford to give away the progress we've made. We do need to remain vigilant.""

He confirmed that the Waitematā DHB's review into Waitakere Hospital will be released at 2pm this afternoon.

'NZ is about to enter a very tough winter'

New Zealand is moving into a phased alert level 2 this week, with retail, malls, cafes, restaurants, cinemas and other public spaces including playgrounds and gyms able to reopen tomorrow. Schools will return to normal classes from Monday 18 May, while bars will have to wait until Thursday 21 May to reopen.

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said today discussions were underway with church leaders, funeral directors, and iwi leaders to see if they could find a way to satisfy the legitimate health concerns.

She said while there will still be restrictions, she was confident there will be a positive resolution.

Ardern said the Health Minister will have more details before the end of the day.

The prime minister said tomorrow's Budget will be delivered in the most challenging economic conditions faced by any government since the Great Depression.

""The coming months and years will be some of the most challenging our country has faced in a very, very long time.""

She said around the world unemployment will rise significantly, businesses will fail and close, government revenue will decline, and this country will also feel the pain.

""New Zealand is about to enter a very tough winter, but every winter eventually is followed by spring, and if we make the right choices, we can get New Zealanders back to work, and our economy quickly moving again.""

She said the Budget will be the first step in recovery from Covid-19.

""We believe that, when times are hard, you don't cut - you invest.""

She said the government will strengthen the blanket of support it provides and investment will also focus on strengthening schools, hospitals, public houses, roads and railways.

""The notion that, in this time of need, we'd make cuts to essential services so many New Zealanders need more than ever is not only immoral, it's economically wrong.""

Ardern said it will be a ""jobs budget"".

""If anything, the last few months have shown us that, united, we are a formidable force and if we channel that energy into a goal, collectively, we are stronger for it.""",https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/416516/watch-live-ashley-bloomfield-and-jacinda-ardern-on-nz-s-covid-19-response
"New Yorkers in poll want mandated vaccines, regardless of family religious beliefs","New Yorkers in poll want mandated vaccines, regardless of family religious beliefs",1.0,"Nearly 80 percent of New Yorkers in a new poll said vaccinations should be required for kids before they can go to school, regardless of family religious beliefs.

Support for required vaccinations is strong among Democrats, Republicans and independents, according to the latest Siena College poll. Over 75 percent of Republicans, 86 percent of Democrats and 70 percent of independents were in favor.

The latest poll was conducted earlier in March through telephone calls to 700 registered voters in New York. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.2 percentage points.

Vaccine exemptions for kids in school have made headlines in recent months as several parts of the country battle measles outbreaks.

Rockland County outside New York City has been dealing with a measles outbreak since last year. So far, the outbreak includes 147 confirmed cases.

The outbreaks have pushed some officials to take a second look at religious exemptions for vaccines. A new bill in the New York Legislature would allow minors to get vaccinated even if their parents object.

Others in states including Texas have been looking to make vaccine exemptions even easier to obtain.

Measles was largely eliminated in the U.S. after the vaccine was introduced in the 1960s, but some health officials are concerned about potential resurgence given growing opposition to vaccines among some.

The Siena poll also found broad support for making New York's property tax cap permanent.

""Making permanent the property tax cap has strong support from every party and every region,"" Siena pollster Steven Greenberg said in a news release.

Sixty percent of Republicans and independents favor a permanent cap as do 58 percent of Democrats, the poll found.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo has said a permanent tax cap is a must for this year's budget and the state Senate already passed a bill on the issue.

The Assembly has yet to act.

Graham Hughes/The Canadian Press

Canadian offensive lineman Laurent Duvernay-Tardif won’t be helping Kansas City defend their Super Bowl title.

The 29-year-old from Mont-Saint-Hilaire, Que., became the first player to opt out of the upcoming NFL season due to the COVID-19 pandemic Friday. Kansas City’s starting right guard earned a medical degree from McGill University and has been working to fulfil his requirements to become a doctor in the off-season.

He has been on the front lines of the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic this summer and said in a social media post that if he is going to take any health risks, it will be to help patients.

“This is one of the most difficult decisions I have had to make in my life but I must follow my convictions and do what I believe is right for me personally,” Duvernay-Tardif said in a message on Twitter. “This is why I have decided to take the Opt Out Option negotiated by the League and the NFLPA and officially opt out of the 2020 NFL season.

“Being on the frontline during this offseason has given me a different perspective on this pandemic and the stress it puts on individuals and our healthcare system. I cannot allow myself to potentially transmit the virus in our communities simply to play the sport that I love.”

The NFL and its players association agreed earlier Friday to an opt-out clause for the upcoming season. Those who choose to voluntarily will reportedly receive a US$150,000 stipend rather than their contractual salary while those with medical opt outs will receive $350,000.

The deadline to opt out is Aug. 3.

Duvernay-Tardif signed a four-year deal in February 2017. He recently renegotiated the contract and was scheduled to receive a base salary of US$2.75 million this season.

Kansas City welcomed rookies to training camp earlier this week, though most of their time was spent undergoing tests for COVID-19 and routine physicals. Veterans such as Duvernay-Tardif were expected to arrive in the coming days.

Kansas City drafted Duvernay-Tardif in the sixth round of the 2014 NFL draft out of McGill. He’s been a starter at right guard since 2015 and helped Kansas City win the Super Bowl last season, their second overall but first in 50 years.

Why Global Citizens Should Care

Equal rights for all people is vital to achieving the targets set by the UN Global Goals, including ending all forms of discrimination against marginalised and vulnerable groups, including people who are LGBTQ+. Join us here in taking action to support the Global Goals and achieve equality for all.

Botswana's High Court has decriminalised same-sex relationships in a unanimous ruling welcomed by the LGBTQ+ community in the southern African country and beyond.

Same-sex relationships were previously criminalised by the colonial-era section 164 of Botswana's penal code.

According to the code, same-sex relationships are “against the order of nature.” The code stated that homosexuality should be punishable by between two and seven years in prison.

Announcing his ruling on Tuesday, Justice Michael Leburu said discrimination has no place in Botswana.

“A democratic society is one that embraces tolerance, diversity, and open-mindedness,"" he said.

He added that continuing to criminalise sexuality and gender identity holds societies back from reaching their full potential, saying: “Societal inclusion is central to ending poverty and fostering shared prosperity.”

The ruling by Justice Leburu comes after Letsweletse Motshidiemang, a 21-year-old student at the University of Botswana, took on the law by bringing the case to court in March.

“I am in a sexually intimate relationship with a man. I have no doubt that this will be the case for the rest of my life. My friends, roommates at the University of Botswana have accepted me, even at the University of Botswana I feel free and accepted,” he said at the time.

“By virtue of one or more of these provisions of the law, I am prohibited from expressing the greatest emotion of love through the act of enjoying sexual intercourse with another consenting adult male that I am sexually attracted to and who is also sexually attracted to me, as consenting adults,” he said.

In many parts of the world, LGBTQ+ people are rejected, attacked, and discriminated against. In Africa, the discrimination is often fuelled by governments that continue to criminalise same-sex relationships.

At the moment, only 24 out of 54 countries in the continent recognise LGBTQ+ people’s right to exist and thrive. Meanwhile, last month, Milimani high court in Nairobi, Kenya, ruled against decriminalising same-sex relationships.

""This judgement can make a massive change for our lives. This is what excites me the most. The judgement means so much,” said Anna Mmolai-Chalmers, coordinator of at the LGBTQ rights group Legabibo.

She added: “The court has upheld our dignity, our privacy, and our liberty ... It means freedom.”",https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/its-no-longer-a-crime-to-be-gay-in-botswana/?linkId=72658985
Woman marries the man who saved her life during Las Vegas mass shooting,Woman marries the man who saved her life during Las Vegas mass shooting,1.0,"The couple on the night of the festival, just before the mass shooting, and at their courthouse wedding (Picture: @Tragedytolove)

Chantal Melanson was enjoying a night out with friends at a country bar when a stranger came over to chat.

It was day two of the Route 91 Harvest festival in Las Vegas. She was busy dancing with her girlfriends so she laughed at the man who introduced himself as Austin Monfort and kept enjoying herself.

She had no idea that just 24 hours later, that stranger would help to save her life during one of the worst mass shootings that has ever happened in America.

In the weeks that followed, they supported each other, despite Chantal being based in Canada and Austin in California, and soon fell in love, eventually having their legal wedding last November.

They were planning to return to Las Vegas for a huge wedding celebration this May with friends and family but it has been postponed due to coronavirus.

Chantal tells Metro.co.uk: ‘We’ve dealt with everything by focusing on the positive.

‘There was a reason we met when we did. We needed each other in this chaos.’

Chantal, now 29, only went to the festival because a friend called a few weeks before with a spare ticket.

She was able to get some time off work so travelled from Alberta, Canada to Las Vegas for the three day event from 29 September until 1 October 2017.

Chantal and Austin visiting London together (Picture: @Tragedytolove)

Austin, now 24, was at the event with a few of his friends celebrating his friend’s 21st birthday.

Their paths first crossed in Gilley’s – a famous country music bar – on the second night.

After being told off by Chantal for his lack of cowboy boots, Austin kept trying his luck and smiled at her across the dance floor.

They took this picture together less than an hour before the shooting started (Picture: @Tragedytolove)

Eventually they started chatting and dancing together and realised there was a spark.

Chantal says: ‘It just felt like we knew each other forever. We went to grab a bite after the bar and exchanged numbers.’

The next day, when Chantal’s friends wanted to go shopping, she decided to head to the festival early and messaged him to ask if he wanted to meet up.

Austin was there already. They made their way towards the stage and bumped into his friends so she decided to stay dancing and listening to the music together, even after her friends arrived.

Just after 10pm, Stephen Paddock opened fire on the crowd, shooting from his suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel above the crowd, as Chantal and Austin and the rest of the 22,000 attendees watched Jason Aldean on stage.

Chantal says: ‘We thought it was fireworks at the beginning since all big concerts usually have some kind of fireworks, however when it wasn’t stopping, everyone dropped to the ground.

‘We were on the ground across from each other so we both were looking at each other. We stayed on the ground for a while and the shots were not stopping.

‘Austin’s friends parents told everyone to run to safety because the shots were non stop.

‘Everyone ran in different directions but Austin stayed with me and we ran together. We ran across the entire festival grounds stopping a few times to get shelter.’

Austin held onto her tightly and guided her out of the grounds to escape the gun fire.

58 people died in the crowd during the shooting and 869 people were injured. The perpetrator shot himself in his hotel room and was later found by police.

Luckily, Chantal, Austin and their friends escaped unharmed.

Chantal adds: ‘We eventually ran onto a side street and jumped into a taxi with a lady already in the car.

‘We were about to leave, when another lady was running towards us holding her leg and stomach – she had been shot.

‘We were all strangers at that point but tried to help one another and rush to the hospital. We stayed in the hospital overnight due to lockdown and Austin never left my side.

‘He held me throughout the night and kept me safe. After what we had just gone through, he was my safe place.’

Together in Canada (Picture: @Tragedytolove)

The afternoon after the shooting Austin flew home to California but Chantal’s flight was the following day.

When they were both safely at home, they continued to FaceTime everyday and quickly fell in love.

Chantal says: ‘He was the only person I wanted to talk to. It just felt so right and safe talking to him after what we went through. He told me he would come visit me in Canada.

‘Six weeks later he made his promise! And we never spent more than six weeks apart either me going to California or him Canada.’

Being together hasn’t been easy for the pair due to immigration rules.

Chantal explains: ‘We had very important life conversations earlier on since we were from two different countries we had to figure out what life would be like if we stayed together and made this work.’

The proposal (Picture: @Tragedytolove)

Austin proposed on 8 March 2019 after 18 months together in Laguna Beach.

Chantal says: ‘Laguna has been our little getaway since our relationship started. We loved to escape to Laguna for a day or two and just soak all of it in, just me and him.

‘He brought me to our favourite beach and there was no one around. It was perfect.

‘His heart was beating out of his chest when he gave me a hug and he got down on one knee and proposed, followed by a beautiful three course meal.’

Their courthouse wedding day (Picture: @Tragedytolove)

Austin even wore cowboy boots on the beach, in a nod to their first conversation, and he pulled the ring out of one boot to ask the question.

After the proposal, they decided to apply for a K1 Visa, which means that the fiancé of a U.S. citizen can move to be with them but they must marry within 90 days.

After 10 months, in September 2019, the visa was finally granted.

It means that Chantal is unable to work in the U.S. until her green card is granted, but she was excited to get to live with Austin in San Diego.

‘We drove from Alberta Canada to San Diego, California. It was the most exciting road trip ever!’ Chantal says.

‘We had a courthouse wedding for our visa on 1 November as we had to get legally married within 90 days of me entering the country.

‘We made it very small but I still wanted a few pictures taken because it was still a very important day.’

Since then, the couple had been planning a huge wedding for family and friends in Las Vegas for 8 May this year, but sadly it has been postponed due to coronavirus.

‘It’s been a bit stressful as so much planning has gone into it with my whole family living in Canada and his California,’ Chantal adds.

‘However through it all we are just so grateful that we both get to be quarantined together and not in different countries!’

They plan to rearrange their wedding party and celebrate their remarkable love story when lockdown is over.

Please look at the time stamp on the story to see when it was last updated.

SALT LAKE CITY – A Utah school is trying to give homeless students something to ease the obstacles of daily life – a peaceful place to shower and clean their clothes.

East High School officials estimate they have between 50 and 100 students who don’t have access to a shower or a washing machine on a daily basis, according to KSTU.

“A lot of them don’t have them in their own homes, and a lot of them are afraid to ask like their friends or someone else,” said senior Emily Beatse.

Beatse said she feels for these classmates. She’s even seen them hiding around the theater department.

“Cause we have a washing machine and dryer for our costumes, but they’re always very sneaky and they come in during a Saturday rehearsal and hide down in the shop and do it while everyone is up rehearsing,” Beatse said.

Principal Greg Maughan said these students shouldn’t have to live in the shadows. He said everyone who enters this school has the right to be clean.

“I don’t want to go to work if I don’t have clean clothes, I don’t want to go to work if I wasn’t able to shower,” Maughan said.

So the school has provided two new wash rooms, complete with a shower and a washing machine and dryer, that students can use before, during, or after school.

“It’s to feel like they fit in, to feel like they are part of something, and they don’t stand out,” Maughan said. “And the more likely they are to attend, the more likely they are to succeed in class, to graduate and to move on to college and a career.”

Going above and beyond to help students at East High is nothing new. Every day, volunteers are stocking shelves in the school’s food pantry. Without donations from community members and local businesses this pantry and the wash rooms would not be possible.

Maughan wanted to give a special thank you to Chapman-Richards Cares, a local non-profit group that provided the washing machine.

“When my children were at East, the socio-economic makeup of the school was completely different, a lot of credit goes to the administration and to the community who said ‘this is something we need let’s get it started,'” said volunteer Carol Lear.

These wash rooms are scheduled to officially open at some point next week. The student body is trying to come up with a creative name for them. Some suggestions include, The Leopard Lounge or Leopard Laundry.

Britney Spears' father loses bid to retain control of delegating her investments,Britney Spears' father loses bid to retain control of delegating her investments,1.0,"Britney Spears’ battle to remove her father’s conservatorship over her estate continued Thursday as a judge denied her father's objections to how her conservatorship will be delegated.

Britney Spears filed a petition with the court last year to remove her father and to place a financial institution as the sole conservator over her estate. Her attorney, Samuel D. Ingham III, argued last year that the singer was afraid of James ""Jamie"" Spears and would rather a professional financial institution take over her estate.

Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Brenda Penny denied the singer’s petition last year but appointed Bessemer Trust as a co-conservator along with James Spears.

Objections raised by James Spears' attorney, Vivian Thoreen, on how the co-conservatorship would be delegated were rejected Thursday. One objection raised by Thoreen asked that James Spears have the power to delegate investment powers, an issue that was a point of debate between the two attorneys Thursday.

Ingham told the court that the nature of a co-conservatorship is that James Spears' powers as sole conservator, appointed by the court in 2019, would be reduced. Thoreen argued that the court orders should be consistent with the 2019 order that gave him sole conservatorship.

""There's no intent or desire to create unequal power or decision-making as between the two, your honor,"" Thoreen argued. ""This is a way to make it consistent and to not take away powers that Mr. Spears as a conservator had.""

Thoreen also denied a concern raised by Ingham that James Spears would delegate the investment powers to a third party, stating that her client simply wanted ""to be able to delegate the investment decision making authority to Bessemer.""

The objection was denied by the judge. Both James Spears and Bessemer Trust are expected to work together on a budget and investment proposal for Britney Spears' estate following Thursday's hearing.

“My client looks forward to working with Bessemer to continue an investment strategy in the best interests of his daughter,"" Thoreen said in a statement after the hearing.

""My client Jamie Spears has diligently and professionally carried out his duties as one of Britney’s conservators, and his love for his daughter and dedication to protecting her is clearly apparent to the court,"" the statement said.

Another hearing on the conservatorship is scheduled to take place next month.

The pop star’s legal struggle is under new scrutiny following the New York Times’ release of “Framing Britney,” a documentary that followed Britney Spears’ rise to stardom and the media pressure that’s often blamed for her public breakdown in 2007.

James Spears has been her legal conservator for 12 years.

Fans of the singer launched a #FreeBritney movement amid the legal battle, alleging that James Spears has abused what was meant to be a temporary conservatorship. “Framing Britney,” released last week on Hulu, interviewed a number of the activists behind the movement, as well as Britney Spears’ former assistant.

Junior Olivas, a fan who credited Britney Spears’ for helping him through difficult times, was among the #FreeBritney protesters who demonstrated in front of the Los Angeles courthouse while her case was being heard.

“My heart said, ‘No matter what, you’re taking your butt there, and you’re going to help her just the way she helped you,'” Olivas said in the documentary.

A number of celebrities have posted support for Britney Spears following the release of the documentary, including Bette Midler and actress Sarah Jessica Parker.

James Spears defended his conservatorship to Page Six last year, telling the tabloid that he loved his daughter.

“All these conspiracy theorists don’t know anything,” James Spears said. “The world don’t have a clue. It’s up to the court of California to decide what’s best for my daughter. It’s no one else’s business.”

Sam Asghari, who has been dating Britney Spears since 2016, criticized his girlfriend’s father in an Instagram Story on Wednesday and said he had “zero respect” for the man.

“In my opinion, Jamie is a total d---,” Asghari said. “I won't be going into details because I've always respected our privacy but at the same time, I didn't come to this country to not be able to express my opinion and freedom.""",https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/britney-spears-father-loses-bid-retain-control-delegating-her-investments-n1257502?cid=sm_npd_nn_fb_ma&fbclid=IwAR1HHW0YEWTe_x5WxqH6nQm6c2hRDvQa95v1XBLn0yjC4S5JheHle6cDAAM
Video shows fisherman performing C-section on dead shark and releases 98 pups into wild,Fisherman performs C-section on dead shark and releases 98 pups into wild - 'It was a very overwhelming feeling when they started popping out',1.0,"A fisherman performed a caesarean section on a dead shark he accidentally caught and released 98 pups into the wild.

Mathew Orlov, 46, hooked the sevengill 8ft 8in shark off the coast of Barwon Heads in Victoria, Australia.

He said the female had been attacked by another shark and had died before he captured it, but noticed the stomach of the animal was moving.

Mr Orlov then cut open the dead shark to remove the pups, which took nine minutes.

Whether or not the sharks will survive without the mother is unknown.

“As soon as she was on the boat we saw the seven bite marks from another shark,"" he said.

“I could feel through the line when she was being attacked. As soon as we pulled it up I knew was mauled by another shark.

“When I saw the belly moving, instinct kicked in. I’ve never done anything like this before, but I’ve fishing long enough to know we needed to get the pups out as quickly as possible.

“It was a very overwhelming feeling when they started popping out, I got this adrenaline rush. I was just dumbfounded there was so many, we counted 98.”

Mr Orlov said he cooked and ate the dead shark.

“As a fisherman, I catch fish to eat. The meat from this shark fed lots of my family members,” he said.

“I love the ocean and respect they’re an important part of the ecosystem.

“I think the pups chance of survival are high – they swam off quite healthily.

“Some people online have said I should have just thrown it back, but they don’t understand how sharks work.”

Sevengill sharks live for around 30 years and give birth to large litters of between 80 and 95 pups.

Large sharks, such as great whites, can be a threat to sevengill sharks.

Reports of cannibalism among sevengills have also been recorded.

Nearly extinct tigers found breeding in Thai jungle,Nearly extinct tigers found breeding in Thai jungle,1.0,"The critically endangered Indochinese tiger has been found to be breeding in a Thai jungle, providing hope for a subspecies whose total population may number only a couple of hundred.

Conservation authorities in Thailand, along with two international wildlife organisations, released photographs of new tiger cubs in the country’s east.

The images support a scientific survey that confirmed the existence of the world’s second breeding population. The other breeding ground is in the Huai Kha Khaeng wildlife sanctuary in western Thailand.

The Department of National Parks of Thailand, the anti-trafficking group Freeland and Panthera, a wildcat conservation organisation, said only 221 Indochinese tigers were estimated to remain in just two Asian countries, Thailand and neighbouring Myanmar.

The group said it had been tracking the tiger population since 1999 and, for the first time last year, camera traps had photographed six cubs from four mothers.

“Poaching for the illegal wildlife trade stands as the gravest threat to the survival of the tiger, whose numbers in the wild have dwindled from 100,000 a century ago to 3,900 today,” the agencies said in a statement.

It noted the tigers’ “remarkable resilience given wildlife poaching and illegal rosewood logging” in the eastern jungle.

Indochinese tigers are smaller than the better-known Siberian or the Bengal subspecies, which is the most numerous with a total population estimated at 3,500.

Tigers, which once ranged across much of the region, are all but extinct in southern China, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and much of Myanmar. Although there is no evidence of their medicinal effect, tiger bones are used in traditional Asian remedies such as “health tonics”.

Alan Rabinowitz, the chief executive officer of Panthera, said in a video call from New York that Thailand had “one of the best-protected and best tiger areas left in the world”.



“Thailand has shown that you can protect tigers and bring them back. They can do this now in the eastern forest complex as they have done in the western forest complex,” he added.

Panthera said on its website that only 8% of tiger sites had a confirmed breeding population, meaning the photos were “a huge – and rare – win”.

It said: “A breeding population here means that the future of this subspecies is less precarious and could potentially even expand – tigers here could disperse and repopulate Cambodia and Laos, where no breeding populations persist.”

India Will Ban All Single-Use Plastics by 2022,India saying it will ban all single use plastics by 2022,1.0,"News

First comes the leak, then comes the flood.

2018 will be remembered as the year the world waged war on plastic waste — and the revolution has just got serious.

India announced it will ban all single-use plastics by 2022 in the most important leap forward against plastic pollution to date.

Take Action: Call on Governments to Say 'No' to Single-Use Plastics

Prime Minister Modi delivered the bold plan on Tuesday, described by the Guardian as the “most ambitious” move yet against global plastic pollution.

India is the fastest-growing economy in the world, and home to 1.3 billion people. Approximately 15,342 tonnes of plastic waste are wasted by Indians every single day, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), and about 60% of that is recycled — far higher than the global average of 14%.

The quest for material prosperity cant lead to environmental degradation. We must remember that an unclean environment hurts the poor and vulnerable the most. pic.twitter.com/yBX7q6IfQn — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) June 5, 2018

It comes just days after Tamil Nadu, a southern Indian state home to 72 million people, announced it will ban single-use plastics like polythene bags and bottles. That ban will come into force from next year, and will exclude some essential goods like milk, medicines, and oil, according to The Hindu.

It’s part of a wide series of reforms announced for World Environment Day on Tuesday, which India is hosting in 2018.

“The choices that we make today will define our collective future,” said Modi. “The choices may not be easy. But through awareness, technology, and a genuine global partnership, I am sure we can make the right choices. Let us all join together to beat plastic pollution and make this planet a better place to live.”

“Environmental degradation hurts the poor and vulnerable the most,” he continued. “It is the duty of each one of us to ensure that material prosperity does not compromise our environment.”

India also announced a campaign on marine litter, and a move to measure plastic in coastal waters, according to the Guardian. Prime Minister Modi also pledged to make 100 national monuments, including the Taj Mahal, litter-free.

If Modi can deliver on this promise to ""abolish all single-use plastics in India by 2022"", it will be a huge step forwards. It also makes @theresa_may's ""ambition"" to ""end avoidable plastic waste in the UK by 2042"" look ditheringly, dangerously slow. https://t.co/WVe8xXvqp3 — Robert Macfarlane (@RobGMacfarlane) June 6, 2018

On Tuesday the UN released their biggest ever report on plastic pollution. It confirmed that over 50 states were taking action on the issue, including total bans on plastic bags in Kenya and Rwanda. The report also revealed that the Galapagos is set to ban single-use plastics, Sri Lanka will ban styrofoam, and China will insist on biodegradable bags only.

However, the report concluded that far more still must be done to stop plastic entering oceans and rivers.

Approximately 380 million tonnes of plastic are created globally every year — and 8 million tonnes enter the ocean, putting sea life at risk. Remember the whale that died in Thailand after eating 80 plastic bags just last week? It’s the rule, not the exception.

The average plastic bag can take up to 1,000 years to break down — but Modi’s announcement proves that momentum towards tangible change can happen overnight. All it takes is political will — and as Al Gore once told Global Citizen, that is in itself a renewable resource.

Global Citizen campaigns to achieve the UN’s Global Goals, which include action on improving life on land and life below water, and on creating sustainable cities and communities. You can join us by taking action on these issues here.",https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/india-plastic-ban-single-use-2022-modi-pollution-w/

Article content With its tangerine-blushed peel, the Colorado Orange apple had one seemingly insurmountable strike against it. Long-lasting and hardy with a sweet-tart taste, its only obstacle was skin-deep: At a time when people were looking to buy red apples, it just so happened to be orange. “It lost out, like so many of the thousands and thousands of apple varieties that have gone extinct,” Jude Schuenemeyer, who founded the Montezuma Orchard Restoration Project (MORP) in southwestern Colorado with his wife Addie, told NPR in December. “It lost out because it wasn’t the shiny, red apple.” We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

Try refreshing your browser, or Lost apple found: 'Elusive' Colorado Orange apple, thought to be extinct, resurrected Back to video The Colorado Orange was in its heyday in the late 1800s. A winter apple, its flavour blossomed over time, Jude explained. As people made their way through stores of summer and autumn apples, it sat in root cellars improving with each passing day. Once Christmas had arrived, the Colorado Orange — with its “tremendous complexity” — was ready to eat and would only get better leading up to July.

Article content It lost out because it wasn’t the shiny, red apple Jude Schuenemeyer Despite its admirable culinary attributes, by the mid-20th century it had started fading into obscurity — pushed out by a move towards monoculture. “When the Red Delicious came out around 1900, it was just another apple,” Jude recently told CNN. “By 1920, it became the dominant apple. It was a shiny, red apple that grew pretty well everywhere.” Now, after nearly two decades of searching, the Schuenemeyers have rediscovered the Colorado Orange, and hope it will soon be available at farmers’ markets, restaurants and grocery stores. They first read about its unique qualities at a county fair. In 2014, they thought they had found the “lost” apple, but it turned out to be a false alarm. Despite the accounts of “many old-timers,” genetic fingerprinting revealed it to be a York Imperial.

Article content Photo by Courtesy of the Montezuma Orchard Restoration Project Continuing their search over the years, there were more disappointments. But in December 2017, they had reason to be hopeful. The owner of a tree in Canyon City claimed it was a Colorado Orange and “the apples looked the part: oblate, ribbed, yellow and orange in colour, obviously a late-winter apple,” Addie told CNN. They sent samples to horticulture scientists at the University of Minnesota for DNA testing and the results — “unique, unknown” — encouraged them. The next step was comparing some of the specimens they had gathered to four watercolours, each painted by a different United States Department of Agriculture artist in the early 1900s. “After comparing the possible Colorado Orange apples to the watercolours, including cutting them open and comparing the insides, we had an added degree of confidence of having found what we were looking for,” the couple wrote in their newsletter. “If only we could match it to a known horticultural specimen. But how to do that if all were lost?”

Among the 83 replicas of ribbon-winning apples from horticultural fairs past — each logged and indexed — was the Colorado Orange. The shape and colour were a match. “We cannot taste or smell or cut it open for comparison, of course, but this may be as close as we get,” the couple wrote. “Now we are 98 per cent sure give or take three per cent we have found the elusive Colorado Orange apple.”

Article content In order to reestablish the once-lost apple, the Schuenemeyers have since started growing their own trees, which they’ve given to several farmers in the state. “We are the beneficiaries of the gift given to us from 150 years ago,” Jude told CNN. “But, it does us no good to be the only persons growing (it). Our steps now are to get it out to the people.” They’ve received such an extraordinary number of requests for the Colorado Orange, they recently announced they’re placing five trees up for auction. The first auction will end on Oct. 3 and the minimum bid is $100, including shipping within the U.S.; proceeds will fund MORP’s preservation work.

San Jose: Homeless people will be paid $15 an hour to pick up trash in ‘hotspots’,San Jose: Homeless people will be paid $15 an hour to pick up trash in ‘hotspots’,1.0,"San Jose is home to some beautiful architecture and brilliant art, but also to freeway on-ramps and creek embankments that are littered with ugly trash and debris.

Now, the city is launching a new effort to clean up dirty parts of town, and it’ll help dozens of homeless people get back on their feet at the same time.

Starting in November, San Jose will pay more than 25 homeless residents at least $15 an hour to pick up trash at more than 40 “hotspots” around the city.

“We are working to transform lives,” Mayor Sam Liccardo said during a press conference at Downtown Streets Team’s San Jose office Thursday morning to announce the new program.

The organization, which works to end homelessness, and Goodwill will hire and manage the workers. Normandin Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ram offered steep discounts on two trucks to support the effort. The ultimate goal is to help participants transition into full-time employment.

The litter hotspots identified stretch across the city, from Senter Road near Capitol Expressway to Willow Street under Highway 87 and Mabury Road near Interstate 680.

One of the hotspots that crews will patrol is around the Tully ballfields on Tully Road near Galveston Avenue, where Little League families have complained recently about an increasingly unsafe environment. A number of homeless people live near Coyote Creek, which runs alongside the ballfields, and the area is often strewn with litter.

Jonathan Fleming, president of the nearby Senter Monterey Neighborhood Association, said he’s “extremely excited” about the new program.

Fleming, who proposed a similar idea earlier this year as part of an unsuccessful bid for a seat on the City Council, said he thinks the program will give participants a sense of purpose. And he’s hopeful workers who clear debris from the area can talk with residents of the nearby encampments and encourage them to help keep the area clean by gathering their trash together rather than allowing it to litter the ground.

“I’m very optimistic and hopeful that it will help,” Fleming said.

In addition to helping beautify San Jose and giving the city’s homeless residents an opportunity to work, Liccardo said the program is an effort to “change the narrative.”

Too often, people see trash on roadsides or creek embankments and place blame solely on homeless people, the mayor said, when “the fact is, it comes from many sources.”

Christine Gonzalez, a domestic violence victim who lost her home after battling a drug addiction and spending years couch surfing, completed an application to participate in the program. Gonzalez said she’s been volunteering with Downtown Streets Team for several years — and receiving gift cards for basic necessities in return — but appreciates the opportunity to earn a paycheck.

The program will initially be funded through a $200,000 litter abatement grant approved by the City Council earlier this year, but there’s no set end date and officials would like to see the program continue.

“We want to see this pilot be successful,” said Chris Richardson, of Downtown Streets Team.

Trish Dorsey, vice president of mission services at Goodwill of Silicon Valley, said the program will create a supportive environment to help people transition back into working.

“Goodwill’s mission aligns perfectly with the mayor’s initiative by giving people a hand up versus a hand out,” Dorsey said.

Gerald Caison, who has also experienced homelessness, thinks the new program will help people build up a sense of integrity.

The end of plastic? New plant-based bottles will degrade in a year,The end of plastic? New plant-based bottles will degrade in a year,1.0,"Beer and soft drinks could soon be sipped from “all-plant” bottles under new plans to turn sustainably grown crops into plastic in partnership with major beverage makers.

A biochemicals company in the Netherlands hopes to kickstart investment in a pioneering project that hopes to make plastics from plant sugars rather than fossil fuels.

The plans, devised by renewable chemicals company Avantium, have already won the support of beer-maker Carlsberg, which hopes to sell its pilsner in a cardboard bottle lined with an inner layer of plant plastic.

Avantium’s chief executive, Tom van Aken, says he hopes to greenlight a major investment in the world-leading bioplastics plant in the Netherlands by the end of the year. The project, which remains on track despite the coronavirus lockdown, is set to reveal partnerships with other food and drink companies later in the summer.

The project has the backing of Coca-Cola and Danone, which hope to secure the future of their bottled products by tackling the environmental damage caused by plastic pollution and a reliance on fossil fuels.

Globally around 300 million tonnes of plastic is made from fossil fuels every year, which is a major contributor to the climate crisis. Most of this is not recycled and contributes to the scourge of microplastics in the world’s oceans. Microplastics can take hundreds of years to decompose completely.

“This plastic has very attractive sustainability credentials because it uses no fossil fuels, and can be recycled – but would also degrade in nature much faster than normal plastics do,” says Van Aken.

Avantium’s plant plastic is designed to be resilient enough to contain carbonate drinks. Trials have shown that the plant plastic would decompose in one year using a composter, and a few years longer if left in normal outdoor conditions. But ideally, it should be recycled, said Van Aken.

The bio-refinery plans to break down sustainable plant sugars into simple chemical structures that can then be rearranged to form a new plant-based plastic – which could appear on supermarket shelves by 2023.

The path-finder project will initially make a modest 5,000 tonnes of plastic every year using sugars from corn, wheat or beets. However, Avantium expects its production to grow as demand for renewable plastics climbs.

In time, Avantium plans to use plant sugars from sustainable sourced biowaste so that the rise of plant plastic does not affect the global food supply chain.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/16/the-end-of-plastic-new-plant-based-bottles-will-degrade-in-a-year?
"“World first”: South Australia achieves 100pct solar, and lowest prices in Australia","""World first"": South Australia achieves 100pct solar, and lowest prices in Australia",1.0,"South Australia – maligned by conservatives over the world-leading share of wind and solar in its grid – now boasts the cheapest wholesale electricity prices in the country, even as it reaches “world first” levels of 100 per cent solar power.

The Australian Energy Market Operator, in its latest Quarterly Energy Dynamics report, confirms that South Autralia – as first reported exclusively by RenewEconomy three months ago – served all of its electricity demand for more than an hour shortly after mid-day on October 11 through rooftop and utility scale solar.

AEMO says this is a world-first in a grid of this size, and occurred in a December quarter when South Australia posted the lowest wholesale electricity prices in the country – thanks to the growing share of wind and solar and the increase in rooftop solar PV which is reducing grid demand.

“South Australia’s quarterly average price fell 57 per cent to $29/MWh, representing its lowest average since Q2 2012,” AEMO says, adding that these continued price reductions “were largely a function of its lowest quarterly average demand on record, and increased wind and solar output in Victoria and South Australia (328 MW on average).”

This is important recognition for a state unfairly maligned by conservatives, and Australia’s federal Coalition government in particular, for its ground-breaking shift to wind and solar, which critics say had led to the highest electricity prices in the world.

But the truth is that South Australia has long suffered high electricity prices than other states, thanks to its former dependence on expensive gas and coal, and it began to search for cheaper renewable energy options as far back as the 1970s.

When wind and solar prices fell dramatically over the past decade it seized the moment, and is now reaping the rewards, so much so that the state Liberal government has set new goals for “net 100 per cent renewables” by 2030, and a 500 per cent renewable energy target by 2050 reflecting its desire to export clean energy to neighbouring states and overseas.

AEMO points out that the growth in wind and solar has allowed some states, for the first time, to break the nexus between gas prices and electricity prices. So while gas prices have been going up, mostly due to events in international markets, local electricity prices have been mostly falling, thanks to the increase in wind and solar.

South Australia also posted new record lows for what is termed “minimum operating demand” – the demand not served by the growing amounts of rooftop solar, as did Victoria.

Wind is now setting the wholesale price more often than before, and up to eight per cent of the time in South Australia, which also continues to experience the most “negative pricing” events – 17 per cent of the time in the last quarter, a situation worsened by increasing network constraints and transmission line outages.

In South Australia, this resulted in some gas generators trying to shut down to dodge the negative prices and being forced by AEMO to stay online, but this situation will be dramatically reduced over the coming year as new “synchronous condensers”, which do not burn fuel, will come on line and will reduce the need to have gas generators operating at times of high wind and solar output.

Across the main Australian grid, known as the National Electricity Market, AEMO says that increased coal-fired generator outages, coupled with low operational demand, and increased wind and solar shaped the NEM supply mix.

Average black coal-fired generation decreased by 707 MW over the same period a year earlier, reaching its lowest level since late 2014. The decline in generation occurred mainly in New South Wales which fell to its lowest quarterly average on record; a function of increased outages – including for unit upgrades – low operational demand, and displacement by wind and solar. Gas, touted as the essential “transition fuel” by the federal government, fell to its lowest Q4 output since 2005, mainly due to lower operational demand and displacement by wind, solar and hydro. Grid solar generation reached a record quarterly high of 1,018 MW on average, surpassing the previous record set in Q4 2019 by 193 MW. This was mainly a result of new capacity entering the system over the last year as solar irradiation during the quarter was lower than Q4 2019. Average wind generation was 2,441 MW, with the largest increase compared to Q4 2019 occurring in Victoria (+223 MW) followed by Queensland (+93 MW). Quarterly NEM emissions declined to the lowest quarterly level on record at 30.5 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2-e), while the NEM emissions intensity equalled the previous quarterly record low of 0.7 tonnes of CO2-e per megawatt hour.",https://reneweconomy.com.au/world-first-south-australia-achieves-100pct-solar-and-lowest-prices-in-australia/
Ex-Royal Marine and Iraq war hero is selling his medals to pay for four-year-old tot’s £200k treatment for rare cancer,Ex-Royal Marine and Iraq war hero is selling his medals to pay for four-year-old’s £200k treatment for rare cancer,1.0,"A FORMER Royal Marine who served in the 2003 Iraq War is selling his war medals to help fund a four-year-old’s £200,000 cancer treatment.

Veteran Matthew Goodman, 35, read about little Lottie Woods-John's battle with neuroblastoma and decided to step in and help the family.

Despite never meeting Lottie, the married father-of-one, from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, felt touched by her fight and listed his three service medals on eBay.

Matthew, a duty manager at a leisure centre, said: “When I came across Lottie’s campaign, I was heartbroken to read her battle against childhood cancer.

“Her prognosis means she has 85 per cent chance of relapse.

“As a father myself, I couldn’t imagine seeing my baby daughter, Freya, suffering like that and I knew I had to help in some way.

“My medals were just sitting in the drawer doing nothing, and I thought they could be used for something worthwhile.

“They were awarded for the sacrifices I made, but I’m happy to forgo that honour if it means helping a little girl in desperate need.”

Matthew, who served in the Royal Marines for five years, hopes to fetch the maximum amount for his medals to contribute towards Lottie’s fund for further treatment in the US.

In June 2016, Lottie's parents, Charlotte Woods, 36 and David John, 44, an events manager, received the crushing news that their little girl had cancer.

Initially they thought their daughter was suffering from a tummy bug after persistent vomiting.

But when her stomach started to swell, Lottie was rushed to A&E at St Peter’s Hospital in Chertsey, Surrey.

Sadly, doctors discovered a melon-sized tumour in her stomach and she was diagnosed with rare childhood cancer: neuroblastoma.

Less than 100 children in the UK are diagnosed each year, with most sufferers aged under five years old.

It recently claimed the life of Bradley Lowery who melted hearts during his five-year battle with the rare cancer.

Lottie’s parents were told their daughter had aggressive stage 4 cancer which had spread to her bones and bone marrow.

The youngster immediately underwent chemotherapy and, in October last year, had a 13-hour operation to remove 95 per cent of the 12cm tumour.

Now the tot is undergoing immunotherapy to zap the rest of the cancerous cells in her body, but desperately needs an innovative vaccine treatment available in America.

Charlotte, Lottie’s full time carer, who lives in Addlestone, Surrey, said: “Lottie has been given 20 per cent chance of surviving the next five years and there's an 85 per cent chance of the cancer returning.

“At the moment Lottie’s health is up and down. One minute she’ll be happily playing in the garden and the next, her temperature will spike and she’ll be rushed to hospital in an ambulance.

“We are living day to day and don’t know what the future holds.

“The vaccine treatment prevents the cancer from returning, so Lottie needs the cutting-edge treatment straight away, meaning we need the £200,000 imminently.

Charlotte, who has two other children, Georgia, 18 and Jack, 16, added: “When Matt contacted me to tell me he wanted to sell his medals to help towards treatment costs I was speechless.

“He risked his life for those medals and the fact that he’s not even met Lottie, but wants to help keep her alive is mind-blowing.

“I can’t thank him enough.”

Matthew, who served in Afghanistan, Iraq and Northern Ireland, said: “Raising that amount of money is a monumental task.

""If people stand up and support families like Lottie’s then it makes all the difference.

“I hope to set a really nice example to my daughter when she grows up.

Noah Irvine receives national award for his effort to create a national suicide prevention plan,Canadian teen who pressured law-makers to create a more comprehensive suicide prevention plan awarded with a national award.,1.0,"Irvine accepted the Samara Canada Everyday Political Citizen Award Tuesday in Toronto

Noah Irvine didn’t intend on becoming the poster boy for mental illness and suicide prevention, but the Guelph teenager is promising to use his new-found notoriety to continue to press for change from all levels of government.

For Irvine, winning the Samara Canada Everyday Political Citizen Award is one more opportunity for him to push for the creation of a national suicide prevention plan and to advance the discussion on mental illness.

“I never wanted to use my parents’ deaths to get something in terms of recognition, I used it so people could understand what the actual face of mental illness and suicide is in Canada,” said Irvine.

He accepted the award Thursday in Toronto.

Irvine’s story went national this summer when he expressed his displeasure with the lack of response he received after writing letters to every member of parliament in Canada, challenging them to take action and address the country’s suicide crisis.

Since then, he has received a personal phone call from the Prime Minister of Canada, met with the federal Health Minister and received a standing ovation from the Ontario Legislature, to name just a few of his achievements.

Irvine doesn’t plan on going away or giving any of them a break.

“Out of all of this, what I have learned is, as much as the government will promise a lot, it’s up to us as Canadians to hold them accountable,” he said.

Irvine said his experience in engaging the conversation at the political level is an example of how democracy should work.

“Many politicians promise lots of things and then say they will get back to us, but it’s up to us to hold them accountable. I think I’ve done a pretty good job of that,” he said.

Last year, Jill Goodreau was teaching Irvine in her Grade 11 intro to Psychology, Sociology and Anthropology at GCVI in Guelph.

Knowing the history of his family, Goodreau suggested Irvine write a letter about his experiences.

In the letter, Irvine explained how he lost his mother to suicide when he was just five years old and about the loss of his father in 2015 to mental illness.

His father was 40 when he died and his mother was just 24 years of age at the time of her suicide.

“At the time the plan wasn’t to necessarily send it to anybody, but to write it and get a mark. He did his research and the letter came back well written and articulate,” said Goodreau.

She challenged him to actually send the letter off. It was Irvine’s idea to send it to every member of parliament across the country.

“I think by channelling his frustration into the letters, he took it beyond what my expectation was,” said Goodreau.

“It was just a pebble that he grew into a mountain,” she added.

Goodreau said the change she has witnessed in Irvine since has been incredible.

“He’s gone to speak at other schools about his experience. He was the kid that wouldn’t do any presentations in class. The confidence that it has built and the honouring of his parents has been truly remarkable,” she said.

Irvine said the experience of writing the letters has given him the encouragement to pursue a university education.

“I had never really considered post-secondary at all. I have a learning disability and it really affects every facet of how I learn and how I do in school.”

“It’s only because of this that I realize you may be labelled with something, but you can become more than that. I think I have proven it,” he said.

No final decision has been made, but Irvine is considering applying for a Political Science program or History.

“I am doing a lot more than I ever though I could without a high school diploma. How much could I do with one and with a university degree?” he said.

Irvine now lives with his grandparents and credits his entire family with supporting him while he has been dealing with the national spotlight.

“Obviously it’s not easy to see your brother or your sister on national television and knowing they are not around anymore, but some family have told me it’s good to know they didn’t die for nothing. Their deaths actually contributed to some form of change, some sort of conversation was started because of their deaths,” said Irvine.

Stories like Irvine’s — of students meeting and exceeding their expectations — is one of the reasons Goodreau said became a teacher and she said she is so proud of his decision to pursue a higher education.

“He has to go into politics. I have told him he has to be a political advocate for mental health. He has the skills to be able to do that,” she said.

Irvine was one of four winners in the under-30 category of the Samara Canada Everyday Political Citizen Award and, at age 17, this year’s youngest recipient.

Samara Canada is a charitable organization dedicated to reconnecting citizens to politics.

Kendall Anderson, managing director of Samara Canada, said Irvine is a prime example of an everyday political citizen.

“He took that personal issue and raised it to the political level. Not everybody who is going to be experiencing the things he experienced will be able to do that, so he is really giving a voice to the people who would be otherwise unheard,” said Anderson.

Irvine said it was an honour to have been nominated with such a group of politically-engaged young people.

“To be nominated and then to be picked among other people who are doing amazing things for this country — moving forward with issues they care about and wanting to do more in their communities — I think it’s excellent,” said Irvine.

He said the ceremony will give him an opportunity to meet other young people engaged in the political process.

Irvine also sees the ceremony as an opportunity to get his foot in the door in having face-to-face conversations with the senators expected to be in attendance.

Irvine has spoken with many members of parliament, but so far has met with very few members of the Red Chamber.

“When you’re unelected it’s hard to find you. They’re a little harder to get a hold of,” said Irvine.

A federal mental health secretariat would provide a spotlight focusing on mental health at the highest levels of government, said Irvine, and he would like to see mental health ministries created within provincial governments.

Goodreau said the fact Irvine sees the ceremony as an opportunity to continue to advance the conversation instead of simply accepting praise is one of the things that makes his story so compelling.

“He did not do this to pad a resume or get a course credit. This is very real for him,” she said.",https://www.guelphtoday.com/local-news/noah-irvine-receives-national-award-for-his-effort-to-create-a-national-suicide-prevention-plan-785832
"Surgeons repair spina bifida in fetus for 1st time in Canada, hospitals say",Surgeons repair spina bifida in fetus for 1st time in Canada,1.0,"For the first time in Canada, a team of surgeons has successfully performed in-utero surgery to repair a form of spina bifida, two Toronto hospitals say.

On Tuesday morning, Mount Sinai Hospital and the Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) introduced Eiko Crisostomo, now almost three months old, and her parents at a news conference in Toronto.

Eiko, seen here in Mount Sinai Hospital's neonatal ICU, was delivered by caesarean section on Aug. 19 — more than two months after having surgery inside her mother's uterus. (Mount Sinai Hospital)

Eiko's parents, Romeo Crisostomo and Romeila Son, learned their baby had spina bifida at their 20-week ultrasound.

""Usually that's that time when you find out the gender,"" Son told reporters. ""We were very excited to finally have a girl after having four boys.""

But they were ""devastated"" to find out that their daughter would be born with a form of spina bifida called myelomeningocele, and would likely suffer brain damage and be in a wheelchair, she said. Son was especially worried her daughter would be in pain and exposed to repeated surgeries during her life.

Myelomeningocele affects about 120 to 150 babies in Canada every year, and occurs when the spinal column fails to close during fetal development.

The spinal cord comes out and is exposed to amniotic fluid, which becomes acidic, said Dr. Greg Ryan, head of Mount Sinai Hospital's neurosurgery team and one of two doctors who led Eiko's surgery.

Eiko was diagnosed with a form of spina bifida called myelomeningocele. Her spinal cord came out of the spinal column. This diagram shows what it looks like before and after in-utero surgery. (Mount Sinai Hospital )

The resulting damage to the spinal cord nervous system causes various degrees of paralysis. Many children need a permanent shunt to relieve pressure on their brains. According to Mount Sinai Hospital, fewer than half of children with spina bifida live independently when they become adults.

Son was determined to do whatever she could to help her baby and upon learning the in-utero procedure is performed in the U.S., was prepared to go.

But she met with doctors at Mount Sinai Hospital who had done in-utero surgeries before for other conditions, and they said they were prepared to offer it to her there.

""I wasn't scared,"" Son said on Tuesday. ""I had zero doubt and 100 per cent confidence.""

On June 4, a joint team of doctors and nurses from Mount Sinai and SickKids performed the surgery, when Eiko was at 25 weeks gestation. Her mother was given a general anesthetic, and the team inserted a needle through her abdomen to temporarily anesthetize and paralyze the fetus.

They then made incisions into the uterus to reach the fetus and close the skin over the spinal defect. The team also replaced amniotic fluid lost from the uterus during the procedure through a catheter — a critical step to keeping the fetus healthy.

More than two months later, on Aug. 19., Eiko was born by caesarean section.

Eiko's parents and four brothers are thrilled with the new addition to their family. (Mount Sinai Hospital)

Now almost three months old, Eiko's parents are hopeful about her future, as she smiled and wriggled in her father's arms while her mother spoke on Tuesday. At home, Eiko is ""doing very normal baby things,"" Son said.

""Right now, her brain is stable, her legs are moving and kicking as you can see,"" Son said. ""All of our prayers were answered. She's our little miracle.""

The in-utero surgery does not guarantee Eiko will not be affected by spina bifida, but research done in the U.S. shows it improves her chances.

According to a U.S. study published in 2011, provided by Mount Sinai Hospital, brain malformations were reduced by one-third; children were half as likely to need walking aids or wheelchairs, and the need for brain shunts was reduced by half.

Since Eiko's surgery in June, the hospitals said Tuesday they had done the procedure three more times.

Son said she is happy that the in-utero procedure is now available to parents ""on Canadian soil.""",http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/spina-bifida-repaired-in-utero-canada-1.4400782
War veteran's 'amazing' recovery from coronavirus at the age of 98,98 yo WW2 veteran who contracted both Malaria and Cholera during forced labour at a Japanese POW Camp beats COVID19.,1.0,"Get our daily Echo newsletter for the biggest stories and breaking news Invalid Email Something went wrong, please try again later.

A 98-year-old war veteran who came down with coronavirus amazed hospital staff with the speed of his recovery from the potentially deadly disease.

The family of George Boag-Munroe feared the worst when he tested positive for Covid-19 while being treated for pneumonia at Aintree Hospital.

If that wasn't enough, only a few days before he had suffered a significant fall at home, injuring his head and splitting his elbow open.

But after two weeks in hospital, George, who was a Far Eastern prisoner-of-war during World War Two, was declared well enough to return home by doctors.

Proud grand-daughter Alison said: ""The nursing staff were amazed he recovered so quickly.

""Even before he was discharged, he was dressed and up and about. At one point he was mistaken for a visitor who had made it to the ward!

""He is still suffering slightly from his head injury and doesn't understand the full impact of the virus that he has recovered from.

""He is unsure what the fuss is about and I don't think he realises the severity of it.""

George, who will be 99 in November, grew up in Anfield and worked as a bike messenger around Liverpool before being conscripted into the Royal Army Ordinance Corps in 1939.

His amazing wartime record includes being taken prisoner by the Japanese in February 1942 after travelling to Singapore, and being held in prisoner of war camps both there and in Thailand.

He worked on the infamous Burma Railway, and suffered from many tropical diseases including malaria, beri beri, tropical ulcers and cholera.

George only narrowly avoided being in Nagasaki when the US dropped the atomic bomb on the city because the boat that was taking him there was torpedoed and sunk. He was taken back to Thailand instead.

Because of his long captivity, he'd been feared dead by his family back home in Liverpool. Once he returned home, he said he had no desire to travel again and only wanted to see Liverpool win the Northern League Cup that year.

George is typically modest about his wartime experiences and still attends St George's Hall Service of Remembrance every year on Remembrance Sunday.

Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban loaned the team plane to Mavs guard J.J. Barea so he could bring supplies to his native Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria.

Tim MacMahon of ESPN passed along the news and noted Barea is scheduled to return Tuesday night with his mother and grandmother.

The 33-year-old Puerto Rican national team standout started a YouCaring crowdfunding effort after Hurricane Maria, which has already raised over $140,000 from 850 donors.

On Monday, Barea confirmed he finally reached his parents Sunday to confirm they were safe after an extended wait following the storm, per Eddie Sefko of the Dallas Morning News.

""They're OK,"" he said. ""But it's still rough there.""

Chandrika Narayan of CNN reported Maria left ""apocalyptic"" devastation in its wake, including ""flooding, crippled communications, decimated buildings"" and ongoing threats, led by the potential collapse of the Guajataca Dam.

Nicole Friedman of the Wall Street Journal noted the hurricane caused ""estimated $40 billion to $85 billion in insured losses,"" most of which occurred in Puerto Rico.

Denmark rids itself of foreign debt for first time in 183 years,Denmark rids itself of foreign debt for first time in 183 years [X-post from /r/Europe],1.0,"A debt milestone for Denmark.

The country will pay off its last foreign currency loan worth $1.5 billion (€1.4 billion) on Monday – ridding itself of any FX debt obligations for the first time in at least 183 years.

Data from the Danish central bank shows the last time the central government was near paying off all its foreign currency loans was back in 1894 – when FX debt totalled less than 1 per cent of GDP.

The country first raised its foreign debt in 1757 when it issued a loan worth half a million rigsdaler from Germany and the Netherlands. Historically, Denmark has raised foreign currency debt to bulk up its FX reserves but vast amounts of currency intervention in recent years – designed to keep a lid on its krone peg with the euro – led Danish FX reserves to hit an all-time record back in 2015.

Swelled

“The central government has not needed to raise any loans in foreign currency, and the loans have been gradually repaid”, the central bank said on Monday.

The country’s foreign debt bill first swelled to finance the wars of the 19th century and later as the Danes embarked on deficit-financed spending in the 1980s but obligations have been steadily shrinking since the financial crisis.

Still, Denmark’s last FX repayment also does not mean the country is without any central government debt, only that it is all now denominated in krone.

Denmark’s overall debt-to-GDP ratio is one of the lowest among Europe’s major economies, standing at 38 per cent and is expected to fall to around 36 per cent in 2018 according to the European Commission.

An Ohio family is celebrating the recent homecoming of their 17-month-old daughter, who has already beaten cancer twice.

Grace Rosian, who has Down syndrome and was born two months prematurely, was diagnosed with a form of leukemia at birth. Grace underwent her first rounds of chemotherapy at just two days old.

While she was given the all-clear to head home after two months, the cancer returned in the form of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in August 2017. Because the treatment carries a high-risk of infection, Grace was hospitalized for eight months, during which she received 10 spinal tap procedures so that she could receive the chemotherapy directly into her spinal fluid.

LAWSUIT ALLEGES MICHIGAN ILLEGALL OBTAINS NEWBORNS' BLOOD

“With everything Grace has been through, she’s always been a happy baby,” Valerie Revell Rosian, Grace’s mother, said on the Cleveland Clinic newsroom blog. “I don’t think a single day went by that we weren’t able to get a smile out of her.”

Rosian said that since her daughter has been born, the family has only had her home for about five or six months, with the rest broken up into hospital stays and doctor visits.

“On her pictures for her first birthday, it hurts my heart to look at them,” Rosian told People magazine. “We tried so hard to make it special for her, she was so sick. She looked so sick.”

“When I got the news that I could take her home, I was like ‘I can breathe now,’” Rosian told People. “It felt good but strange because most of my time with her had been at the hospital. When I got to have her home, it felt good because now I can be the mom. I can be the mom 100 percent.”

"African cheetah to be re-introduced in India after it was declared extinct 68 years ago- Technology News, Firstpost",African cheetah to be re-introduced in India after it was declared extinct 68 years ago,1.0,"Press Trust of India

Experts from the Dehradun-based Wildlife Institute of India have visited four places in Madhya Pradesh to look for the best habitat for the reintroduction of cheetah in the country, a senior forest official said. The country's last spotted cheetah died in Chhattisgarh in 1947. Later, the cheetah — which is the fastest land mammal — was declared extinct in India in 1952. The Wildlife Institute of India (WII) some years back prepared a cheetah re-introduction project. The Supreme Court in January this year gave its approval to introduce African cheetahs to suitable habitat in India on an experimental basis.

A WII team some days back visited the Kuno Palpur sanctuary in MP's Sheopur district, the Nauradehi sanctuary in Sagar district, the Gandhi Sagar sanctuary on the northern boundary of Mandsaur and Neemuch districts and the Madhav National Park in Shivpuri district, the official said.

""WII's faculty of wildlife science dean Dr Y V Jhala and two other scientists inspected the four places to evaluate whether these habitats are conducive for cheetahs,"" Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forests, wildlife wing, J S Chauhan, told PTI.

The home for cheetahs would be picked up considering their prey base, safety and topography.

""Madhya Pradesh had in the past been home to cheetahs. The state has a long conservation history; we have the habitat. We also have a successful trans-location record,"" Chauhan said, referring to the tiger re-introduction programme in the Panna Tiger Reserve (PTR) in 2009.

MP houses six major tiger reserves, including Bandhavgarh, Pench and Kanha tiger reserves.

""For the cheetah re-introduction, many things stand in our favour. We have already written to the central government that we are very much interested (in the plan),"" Chauhan said.

The cheetah was declared extinct from India in 1952.

The animal is considered vulnerable under the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)s red list of threatened species, with a declining population of less than 7,000 found primarily in African savannas.

The Supreme Court earlier this year set up a three-member committee to guide the National Tiger Conservation Authority on the cheetah re-introduction project.

The panel has asked the WII to carry out a technical evaluation of all possible sites for the re-introduction of cheetah in the country.",https://www.firstpost.com/tech/science/african-cheetah-to-be-re-introduced-in-india-after-it-was-declared-extinct-68-years-ago-9090871.html
Reading matters: Books can make a big difference in a child’s life and school performance; adults needed,"Experts know that reading to toddlers & babies, can make a big difference in children’s reading abilities later in school. But does giving away free books to low-income families with young children help with early reading? An analysis of 44 studies of book giveaway programs concludes that it does.",1.0,"

The Hechinger Report

Literacy experts have long known that reading to toddlers, even babies, can make a big difference in children’s reading abilities later in elementary school. But does simply giving away free books to low-income families with young children help with early reading? An analysis of 44 studies of book giveaway programs concludes that free stuff does work.

Three researchers from the Netherlands and Australia looked for all the high-quality studies they could find on book giveaway programs, which reach millions of children under 5 in North America and Europe, and focused on the ones that compared the early literacy of children who received books with those who didn’t. Despite the large number of studies that made the cut (44), only three giveaway programs were analyzed by all of them: Bookstart, Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library and Reach Out and Read. (Multiple studies of the same program tested how the program worked with different kids and in different places.)

The three programs are quite different. Bookstart, a program that originated in the United Kingdom, gives only one or two free books on one or two occasions. Imagination Library, launched by American country music star Dolly Parton, mails a new book a month from birth to age 5. Reach Out and Read uses health professionals instead of the postal service; pediatricians and nurses hand out books out during regular checkups and are trained to tell parents that reading is important for cognitive development. At some health clinics, volunteers model effective book reading strategies for parents. Some of the programs give books to all families who want them regardless of income, but the studies mostly focused on low-income children — the intended target audience.

All three programs worked when measured by how much parents read to children and by how much kids’ early literacy skills improved. But the program that used healthcare professionals to give out the books and personally tell parents to read them achieved the largest literacy gains.

“Participation in any book giveaway program yielded a positive effect,” said Ingrid Willenberg, one of the researchers, by email. “[But] we found that programs like Reach Out and Read, that involve interaction with parents and provide guidance on how to read, showed a greater effect.”

Willenberg, a senior lecturer at Australian Catholic University, was one of the three authors of the meta-analysis, “Do Book Giveaway Programs Promote the Home Literacy Environment and Children’s Literacy-Related Behavior and Skills?” published in the journal Review of Educational Research in May 2020.

The number of free books, it turned out, didn’t matter. Bookstart, which gives away only a few, was just as effective as Dolly Parton’s Imagination Library which gives out 60 books to each child over five years. (Reach Out and Read distributes about 10 books to each child over the same period.) What this means is that the giveaway programs don’t need to build an entire library for each child to be successful. This compilation of research supports the theory that an age-appropriate book or two laying around the living room can be an effective nudge for the parent to read. “The book gift may entice caregivers to try shared book reading, which may then lead to the development of a regular book reading routine, especially when these incidental attempts are positive experiences for both the caregiver and the child,” the authors wrote.

Harvard education professor James Kim, a reading specialist, cautions against mailing out books without some sort of parent interaction.

“I would say that the most cost-effective and effective approach is not simply to give books to kids/families but to ensure that there is some form of support via contacts, tips on shared reading, and providing ongoing nudges/supports,” Kim told me via email. “Books are not a causal mechanism. Reading books and shared reading is the mechanism that leads to better skills. Books are just the resource that facilitates these literacy processes.”

And yet the authors of the book giveaway meta-analysis characterized the literacy benefits of simply giving away books as “impressive.” They noted that in a 2011 meta-analysis, more expensive family programs that involved parent guidance and training had a smaller literacy benefit than what they calculated for book giveaways. Eliminating human intermediaries also keeps costs low. Dolly Parton’s 60-book giveaway can cost as little as $126 per child over five years, the authors noted. A doctor’s or an educator’s time is much more expensive.

Given the cost-effectiveness of the hands-off approach, the researchers suggest expanding book giveaways to more countries, especially places like sub-Saharan Africa and Middle Eastern refugee camps where many children don’t have access to books. As Dolly Parton herself once wrote, “True love, so hard to find, it knows no boundaries.” The same might be said for reading.

Twin girls conjoined at the head successfully separated by 30-strong surgical team,Twin girls conjoined at the head successfully separated by 30-strong surgical team,1.0,"Twin girls conjoined at the head have been successfully separated by a 30-strong team at a children’s hospital in Pennsylvania.

Erin and Abby Delaney’s shared blood vessels and the protective membrane around their brains had to be carefully teased apart during the 11-hour surgery.

The surgeons then split into two groups to perform reconstruction on each girl.

Surgery equipment such as monitors and tape was marked with green or purple tape to differentiate each girl.

At first his parents said they thought he meant he saved a life when playing a video game.,1.0,"HENRICO COUNTY, Va. – A fifth grader in Henrico has been hailed a hero for jumping into action when he saw a classmate choking at lunch; she was starting to turn colors and gasping for breath.

“I wasn`t really calm, my heart was racing I just knew I had to help her,” said Benjamin Ford.

Though he was nervous, school officials said the fifth grader had all the right moves. Benjamin said he knew what to do because he relied on information that he learned in a documentary a few years ago, which he watched with his mom.

Ben was recognized by Greenwood Elementary school administrators, who shared the story of his heroic intervention with the entire school.

His parents said they were super proud of how quickly he acted and are thankful he remembered the documentary.

“I felt like I had to hurry up and get to her,” Benjamin said. “…I thought in a couple more seconds she might not make it.”

“I got a lot of claps and I had a lot of fist bumps and they were really supportive when I walked down the hall,” Benjamin said.

At first his parents said they thought he meant he saved a life when playing a video game.

“Then we found out it was a real person we were shocked....it was awesome,” his mom said.

Woman tells police she had been beaten and held captive

(CNN) A UPS driver who spotted ""call 911"" scrawled on a package helped police free a woman who had been held captive in her own home and sexually assaulted, authorities said.

""He was a huge help,"" Franklin County Sheriff's Department Sgt. T.J. Wild told CNN affiliate KMOV

The driver called police after making a scheduled stop to pick up the package at a home in Robertsville, Missouri, on Tuesday. A SWAT team sent to the house in response to his call took 33-year-old James Tyler Jordan into custody, police said.

Jordan's wife told authorities that her husband had refused to let her leave, punched and slapped her, forced her to strip and sexually assaulted her, court documents state. She said he was holding a gun to her head and threatening to kill her, then himself, when the UPS driver arrived.

Jordan allegedly had her talk with the driver while standing behind her with a gun. Somehow she had managed to write her plea for help on the package, according to the documents.

Hundreds of people are volunteering to escort elderly Asian Americans to help keep them safe,Hundreds of people are volunteering to escort elderly Asian Americans to help keep them safe,1.0,"(CNN) Jacob Azevedo's stomach turned as he watched a disturbing video of an 84-year-old Thai American man who was fatally shoved to the ground on a sidewalk in San Francisco.

It was the second video of an unprovoked attack on an elderly Asian American that Azevedo, a resident of Oakland, had seen on social media out of the Bay Area within an hour, he told CNN.

Ever since the world learned of the new coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China, harassment and violence targeting the Asian American and Pacific Islander community has rapidly increased across the United States.

More than 2,808 firsthand accounts of anti-Asian hate from 47 states and the District of Columbia were reported between March 19 and December 31, 2020, with 7.3% of those incidents involving Asian Americans over the age of 60, according to a report by Stop AAPI Hate , a coalition documenting anti-Asian hate and discrimination amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Exhausted by the violence, Azevedo offered on social media to walk with anyone in Oakland's Chinatown neighborhood to help them feel safe.

""I wasn't intending to be some kind of vigilante,"" Azevedo, 26, told CNN. ""I just wanted to offer people some kind of comfort.""

His idea quickly resonated throughout the community and within days he had nearly 300 volunteers reaching out to join him to protect the community in a project now called Compassion in Oakland

Azevedo, who is of Hispanic descent, believes this is a moment for all minority groups to stand in solidarity with the Asian American community. He said people from all racial backgrounds and ages reached out to him sharing the same desire to help support the community.

""This is important because this community just needs healing,"" Azevedo said. ""There's a lot of racial tensions going on because of the previous president's rhetoric but in general our communities need healing. This is an issue that's been ongoing for a while.""

Stop APPI Hate Co-Founder, Cynthia Choi, told CNN that crime and violence is nothing new to the Asian community.

""This is a problem and issue that doesn't get a lot of attention, especially in low income communities,"" Choi said. "" And of course the pandemic, I think has exacerbated the conditions and exposed racial disparities.""

Choi said in times of crisis when vulnerable people are being targeted it's heartwarming to see community members come out and take action.

""In Oakland, they're planning this action and it's really less about controlling and more about supporting the community and showing up,"" she said. ""It's showing our elders who are afraid, afraid to leave their house that we're here, we want to support you we're holding you right now.""

Azevedo hopes that the organization can work with law enforcement in the future to protect the community.

""All of us need to come together if we hope to make this a safer community for the years to come,"" Azevedo said.

The group planned a soft launch of the project on Saturday with a few volunteer groups on the streets. They hope to continue to build awareness of the issue in the community.",https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/15/us/volunteer-group-helps-to-keep-elderly-asian-americans-safe-trnd/index.html
Father fired for attending child's birth inundated with job offers,New father fired for attending child's birth inundated with job offers,1.0,"A New Hampshire man lost his job when he chose between work and welcoming his newborn son into the world. But once word of his sacking spread, he received an outpouring of support – including a flood of new job offers.

Lamar Austin worked for Salerno Protective Services, a private security group for college campuses and retail stores. He was in the middle of his 90-day trial period and was expected to be on call night and day.

But Mr Austin could not attend his weekend shift once his wife, Lindsay, went into labour – which lasted from Friday evening through Sunday morning, when Mr Austin received a text informing him he was “terminated”.

“Sometimes you lose something and you get something even better,” Mr Austin told the Concord Monitor, while with his wife and new son, Cainin – the first baby born in the state of New Hampshire in 2017.

When the local newspaper first reported the story of Mr Austin’s job loss, former town board member and paid family leave advocate Sara Persechino, launched a GoFundMe campaign for the family.

“I don’t think they should have to be worrying about financial issues right now; it should be a joyful time for them,” she said. “I don’t think anyone should ever have to choose between their family and their job.”

In addition to the public support, Mr Austin said he had received three job offers, as well as an apprenticeship from the local business manager of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and from the labour union, AFL-CIO.

Microsoft Japan's experiment with 3-day weekend boosts worker productivity by 40 percent,Microsoft Japan's experiment with 3-day weekend boosts worker productivity by 40 percent,1.0,"As it turns out, not squeezing employees dry like a sponge is maybe a good thing.

Japan has a reputation for not being so great when it comes to work-life balance. And it’s a reputation that makes sense, considering the country routinely scores toward the bottom when it comes to employee satisfaction around the developed world.

For decades this has been a known problem, usually resulting in companies having after-hours meetings to try and figure out how to reduce after-hours meetings, or just shrugging and declaring that “it can’t be helped.”

But some businesses are finally taking actual steps to address the problem. And one of them is probably the last company that many would expect: Microsoft Japan.

▼ A company that big might not seem like it would need to change anything, since people will always want to work there, so hearing they’re trying changes is exciting.

Last August, Microsoft Japan carried out a “Working Reform Project” called the Work-Life Choice Challenge Summer 2019. For one month last August, the company implemented a three-day weekend every week, giving 2,300 employees every Friday off during the month. This “special paid vacation” did not come at the expense of any other vacation time.

And the results were pretty incredible!

First off, the reductions. Employees took 25.4 percent fewer days off during the month, printed 58.7 percent fewer pages, and used 23.1 percent less electricity in the office (since it was closed an extra day). All of these saved the company quite a bit of money.

Next, the increases. Productivity went up by a staggering 39.9 percent. That means even though the employees were at work for less time, more work was actually getting done!

▼ A chart showing the changes. The tweet reads: “It’s been proven! Let’s implement the three-day weekend everywhere right now!”

A lot of the increase in productivity is attributed to the changing of meetings. With only four days to get everything done for the week, many meetings were cut, shortened, or changed to virtual meetings instead of in-person.

And even though it should seem obvious, it’s also important to note that 92.1 percent of employees said that they liked the four day workweek at the end of the trial. Due to its success this year, Microsoft is planning on repeating it again next summer or perhaps at other times as well.

Here’s how Japanese netizens reacted:

“Here’s to hoping my boss reads about this.”

“So I guess me feeling like I’m ready to be done for the week by Wednesday is pretty natural.”

“Unfortunately, us Japanese people value ignoring efficiency and wasting time at work over actually being productive.”

“I mean, the people working at Microsoft are first-class employees. I bet they could get everything done in three days.”

“I’d love for this to be implemented more, but I feel like making it work at companies open all week could be difficult. They’d have to hire more workers to rotate through the days.”

“Yeah, Microsoft is different from regular businesses, so I don’t think this would work everywhere.”

While some of the commentors have a point that this kind of policy wouldn’t work for every type of job, one thing is for certain: humans are only capable of doing so much work in a week. Beyond a certain threshold, no matter the job, work isn’t going to be work anymore, it’s just going to be time-padding.

And considering that Japan’s overwork culture can be physically seen from the city streets, taking a chance on something like this and seeing how it goes seems like a far better idea than just sticking with the status quo.

"Former N.J. woman uses couponing to try and feed 30,000 people in need","N.J. woman uses couponing to feed 30,000 people in need",1.0,"When she first learned about couponing, her eyes lit up.

Not because of the potential deals on her groceries. For New Jersey native Lauren Puryear, she realized that couponing was the tool she'd been looking for to bring thousands of meals to people in need.

She has set a goal of delivering 30,000 meals to people who are food insecure by her 30th birthday.

Puryear, 29, currently a Woodbridge, Virg. resident who is a mental health clinician, has been spending years of her time helping to feed the hungry.

It all began four years ago after the death of her grandmother, who had strongly instilled the importance of helping others.

To continue her grandmother's legacy, in 2012, she started an organization, For The Love of Others, which aims to assist people of all backgrounds ""through providing opportunities to enable them to live a purposeful life,"" according to its website.

Though she had been buying food in bulk from stores like Cosco and BJ's, or from online stores like eBay and Amazon, it wasn't enough. She wanted to reach more people.

So, when someone told her about couponing, she quickly realized she could use this old pastime to reach not hundreds, but tens of thousands of hungry people.

""I started couponing for food items like spaghetti, meatballs, and I was (often) able to get the items for free or for little to no money,"" she explained.

If done correctly, she said she can feed as many as 150 people on just $20, depending on the items.

""There are coupons in the Sunday paper, or online that you can print ... so I collect as many as I can, match them to the store and that is how I am able to get the items for free,"" she said.

Though it appears to be a meticulous process, she said once you get the hang of it, it is fairly easy, just requiring a bit of persistence and willingness.

But for Puryear, bringing meals to those in need remains her passion.

When she's not working at her job, the single mother of a five-year-old son toils at bringing meals to people in New Jersey, in Washington, D.C., in Baltimore, and beyond.

So far, she has delivered 5,000 meals. She's confident she will reach her goal by next year.

""It's probably the most exhilarating thing I could ever do in life,"" she said.

Puryear holds four degrees, including a bachelor's, two masters, and a Ph.D. in psychology.

But beyond those accomplishments, she said, ""The joy of helping other people does not compare to any other accomplishment in my life.""

But she also does not forget to pass along to her son what her grandmother had passed along to the rest of her family.

""It is very important to teach him to help other people,"" she said. ""The little things we take for granted, the food we throw away every day ... and if we just spread a little more love around, the world would be such a better place.""

Robert Carter, a single foster dad, officially became a father of five on Friday. Carter adopted siblings Marionna, Makayla, Robert, Giovanni and Kiontae. He said he didn't want the siblings to be separated.The new father of five said he knows first hand how it feels to be removed from a biological home and separated from siblings.When he was 12, Carter went into foster care in Hamilton County, Ohio, and didn't see some of his younger siblings for years.He later was granted custody of his younger sister and guardianship of his younger brother once he was emancipated.Then and now, Carter wanted to make sure families stuck together.“When permanent custody was awarded to JFS, the five siblings were already placed in three different foster homes,” Adoption Worker Stacey Barton said. “Mr. Carter was the only foster parent willing and able to adopt all of the children. His childhood background has made him aware of the importance of keeping siblings together. He says that he enjoys being their father and that parenting them is easier than he could have ever imagined! His life is busy, with a lot of love, laughter and loudness! I have enjoyed working with him and witnessing the children bond as siblings.”Carter was fostering the three boys when he and the girls’ foster moms came together so the kids could see each other for the first time in six months.“I understand how they feel,” Carter said. “I understand what they went through, so it really touched me. I was already thinking about adopting all of the kids but when I saw them crying, I was like, ‘Ok, I’m going to take all five to keep them together.’”Carter said he feels that taking care of his siblings and being involved in mentoring and volunteering at South Avondale Elementary led him to adopt.“Making memories to replace a lot of the bad ones.” Carter said. “Every night I talk to them and let them know, ‘I’m your dad forever. I know what it’s like and I’m always here for you.’ Like Marionna. She’s warmed up so much since the beginning. At first, she didn’t like me. She walked in my room last night and said, ‘I just want to say thanks for taking us in and taking care of us when our real mom couldn’t.’ It just really touched me. So just making memories, letting them know I’m here and they never have to go. I’m here for them no matter what.” Hamilton County experienced a record year in numbers of adoptions in 2019 with 259 children adopted, a 25% increase from 2018.",https://www.wcvb.com/article/im-your-dad-forever-single-foster-dad-adopts-five-siblings-so-they-can-stay-together/34547372
"Inside the 'Nicest Place in America,' a refugee-owned falafel shop in Tennessee","Syrian refugee opens restaurant in Tennessee, wins title of 'Nicest Place in America'",1.0,"""We need to keep building bridges, we need to keep the American dream.""

A falafel restaurant opened by a Syrian refugee in Tennessee has become a pillar in his community, and a gathering place for people from all backgrounds and walks of life to come together over food.

Yassin's Falafel House in Knoxville was the winner of this year's Reader's Digest Nicest Place in America accolade.

""America is the winner. Knoxville is the winner. Tennessee is the winner,"" the restaurant's owner, Yassin Terou, told ""Good Morning America"" anchor Robin Roberts after learning he won. ""It's not me.""

He continued, ""I think this is what makes us the winner, is the people in this country, not us.""

The sign posted at the entrance to Terou's restaurant reads: ""All sizes, all colors, all ages, all sexes, all cultures, all religions, all types, all beliefs, all people, safe here at Yassin’s Falafel House.""

Roberts paid a visit to the restaurant earlier this year, where she met with Terou, a refugee who fled war in his home country of Syria seven years ago.

Now the owner of two wildly popular falafel restaurants in Tennessee, Terou has become a local symbol of the American dream

He said he feels he ""had a second chance of life to be in United States.""

“I just want to tell the American people, you are a great people,"" Terou said on ""GMA."" ""Everybody loves you and we know you love everybody. We are going to keep this country great and we’re going to build it together.""

Terou recalls it was not always smooth sailing when he first arrived in America, though, in part because he wasn't able to speak English very well.

He said he learned how to ""handle hate with love.""

""When you love and give your love to people, you are stronger than one who gives hate,"" he added.

'When you love and give your love to people, you are stronger than one who give hate.'

Terou put Roberts to work in his kitchen, saying, ""today we are making heart-shaped falafel,"" and showing her how to properly make the mix and fry them.

His restaurant is more than just about food, Terou added.

""Yassin's Falafel House is about family, about love, about building community,"" he said. ""So we make sure when you get your food, you smile and feel love with it.""

Many of the employees in his shop are also refugees, Terou added.

""I want to say thank you to Yassin,"" employee Hunar Muhammed told ""GMA."" ""He give me a job ... he helped me a lot.""

Knoxville mayor Madeline Rogero said she feels the city has changed a lot in recent years, saying, ""New businesses like Yassin's have come in.""

""But also as a community, I think we're more welcoming,"" Rogero added.

Rogero said she believes Terou has ""really torn down people's perceptions"" of ""refugees, of Muslims,"" in the ""heart of Appalachia.""

Terou said his final message for those who hear his story is: ""We need to keep building bridges, we need to keep the American dream.""

'We need to keep building bridges, we need to keep the American dream.'

""This is in our hands,"" he added. ""And we need to transfer it in a better situation for the next generation.""",https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Living/inside-nicest-place-america-refugee-owned-falafel-shop/story?id=58414615
Tyler Perry to pay funeral expenses for 8-year-old girl fatally shot in Atlanta,Tyler Perry To Pay Funeral Expenses For 8-Year-Old Girl Fatally Shot In Atlanta,1.0,"ATLANTA — Tyler Perry has offered to pay the funeral expenses for an 8-year-old girl who was fatally shot in Atlanta over the weekend, a representative for the actor and filmmaker confirmed Wednesday.

“I’m outraged today because I’d rather be paying for 8-year-old Secoriea Turner’s college than her funeral,” Perry said in a statement to People magazine. “When does this end?”

Secoriea was riding in a Jeep Cherokee with her mother and another adult on Saturday night when they encountered “a makeshift roadblock that was manned by numerous armed individuals,” Atlanta police Lt. Pete Malecki said. When the driver tried to go around the roadblock, shots were fired and the girl was hit, Malecki told reporters at a news conference Tuesday.

Police released a short video Tuesday of an armed man who they described as a person of interest in the girl’s shooting. Malecki said the video comes from a surveillance camera near where Secoriea was shot. It shows a Black man in a white shirt and dark pants carrying an AR-15 rifle with a tan stock and grip.

A reward of up to $20,000 has been offered for information leading to the arrest and indictment of a suspect in the case.

The girl was shot near the Wendy’s restaurant where a Black man, Rayshard Brooks, was killed by a white police officer June 12. The fast food outlet was later burned, and the area has since become a site for frequent demonstrations against police brutality.

Perry also paid for Brooks’ funeral last month.

DeAngelo Williams pays for mammograms to honor mom who died of breast cancer,"Football star DeAngelo Williams buys 53 mammograms for women to honor mom, who died of breast cancer",1.0,"Former Pittsburgh Steelers running back DeAngelo Williams is still dedicated to fighting breast cancer.

The star running back, who played college football at the University of Memphis, started covering the cost of mammogram screening for women in 2015 through his nonprofit organization, The DeAngelo Williams Foundation.

Since then, the foundation has covered the cost of over 500 mammograms at hospitals located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Memphis, Tennessee; Jonesboro, Arkansas; and Charlotte, North Carolina.

Williams is a staunch supporter of breast cancer awareness. In 2014, his mother Sandra Hill died from breast cancer when she was just 53 years old. Williams also lost his four aunts to the disease, all before the age of 50.

This is dedicated to my mom, my aunts & women everywhere affected by Breast Cancer. I love you. #WeAreInThisTogetherhttps://t.co/bAwaanlfzV — DeAngelo Williams (@DeAngeloRB) October 11, 2015

Williams began sponsoring the free mammogram screening in honor of his mother through the ""53 Strong for Sandra"" program. At each event, the foundation sponsors mammograms for 53 women. The foundation eventually hopes to host a free mammogram screening event in every state.

""To be able to help all these women is amazing. This can be life-changing for these women,"" Williams said in a statement to TODAY recently. ""We are enabling them to get this care that no one should ever be denied or not have access to.""

""DeAngelo wants to ensure that no woman (or man) fights breast cancer alone,"" Risalyn Williams, his wife and executive director of The DeAngelo Williams Foundation, told TODAY via email.

Williams was key in leading a push in 2009 to allow NFL players to wear pink cleats throughout October, Breast Cancer Awareness month. At the time football fans were treated to fields of pink — pink headphones, pink cleats and pink pom poms — during October breast cancer awareness month. In 2015, Williams asked the NFL to allow him to wear pink on his uniform all year, but the league declined.

In recent years, the NFL's partnership with the American Cancer Society has broadened its focus to prevention and early detection of several cancers, including breast cancer, with the ""Crucial Catch"" program.",http://www.today.com/health/deangelo-williams-pays-53-mammograms-honor-mom-who-died-breast-t50306

Tessica Brown raised more than $23,000 on GoFundMe after going viral for her hair mishap.

TMZ reports she'll donate to the Restore Foundation, Michael Obeng's reconstructive surgery non-profit.

Tessica Brown, the woman who went viral after putting Gorilla Glue in her hair instead of hairspray, says she'll give $20,000 she raised through a GoFundMe page to a foundation run by the surgeon who saved her hair.

Louisiana resident Brown went viral in early February after she posted videos on her Instagram and Twitter, saying her hair had been stuck in place for more than a month because she'd used Gorilla Glue as a substitute for hairspray.

After garnering huge attention on the internet, LA-based surgeon Dr. Michael Obeng offered to try to fix Brown's hair for free. Earlier this week, TMZ posted video footage of Obeng operating on Brown's hair.

Videos from after the procedure showed Brown was also able to retain some of her hair in the process. She could also be seen running her fingers through it and feeling her scalp, as Insider's Palmer Haasch reported.

A post shared by Tessica (@im_d_ollady)

Now, Brown appears to want to pay Obeng back by making a sizeable donation to a foundation he runs, TMZ reports.

During her Gorilla Glue saga, Brown launched a GoFundMe page with an initial goal of $1,500 to help her pay for expenses related to what she called ""this unfortunate ordeal.""

""My name is Tessica Brown and I am a small town girl who happened to make a mistake by putting gorilla glue spray on my hair as a substitute for GotB glue hairspray, and as most of you know my hair was stuck in place for about a month,"" she wrote on the page.

""After reading and researching I realized I may need medical help and my hair may need to be shaved, so I made this GoFundMe account to help with any expenses related to this unfortunate ordeal. I would like to thank everyone who reached out.""

Story continues

Following her viral success, donors flooded to the page. As of Sunday morning, Brown has raised more than $23,000.

To thank Obeng for his help in fixing her hair, which he reportedly did not charge for, TMZ reports that Brown will now give the majority of that money to the Restore Foundation. This is a non-profit started by Obeng with the aim of providing reconstructive surgery for people in developing nations.

According to TMZ, Brown's manager says she'll keep roughly $1,000 of the money raised on her GoFundMe to pay for her travel from Louisiana to Los Angeles, and for an emergency room visit she made back home.

"Must Reads: While out for a jog, she discovered a baby buried alive. Twenty years later, they reunite","While out for a jog, she discovered a baby buried alive. Twenty years later, they reunite",1.0,"In 1998, a jogger found a newborn baby buried alive in the foothills of Altadena, his umbilical cord still attached. The baby, not more than a few hours old, hovered near death.

For decades, Azita Milanian would wonder what happened to the boy after he recovered at a Pasadena hospital and was put up for adoption. This week, 20 years to the date of when she found him, the two were reunited.

“I was waiting for you for 20 years,” a tearful Milanian said as she hugged Matthew Whitaker.

It was a reunion that came about in an unlikely way. The mother of one of Whitaker’s friends wrote into the KIIS FM radio station explaining Whitaker’s story and asking for a 23andMe DNA kit so he could learn more about his ancestry.

Whitaker agreed to take the test and have the results revealed during the “On Air with Ryan Seacrest” program. When one of the show’s producers, Patty Rodriguez, read a 1998 Los Angeles Times story of Milanian finding him, she decided to try to reunite them.

Ahead of the program’s taping Wednesday morning, Milanian waited anxiously in a nearby room, with a bag filled with clothes that she had brought for Whitaker. In the bag was a card, with an envelope reading, “Happy Birthday! Baby Christian Mountain Angel Mathew.”

When Milanian walked into the studio and saw Whitaker, she began to cry, sobbing into his shirt as he hugged her and called her an angel.

“Finally, all my dreams came true,” Milanian said. Many in the studio cried.

On the program, Milanian shared the story of how she found Whitaker on a Saturday night when she had been invited to go dancing, but decided instead to go running.

One of her dogs, Tango, had stopped to smell and scratch at the dirt on the trail. Milanian went to investigate and saw two feet coming out of the ground. At first she thought it was an animal, but then she heard the infant cry.

When she started digging, she found a baby wrapped in a blue towel. She lifted him onto her arm and began digging the dirt from his nose and mouth.

“Please don’t die,” she said to the baby. “I will never leave you. I love you.”

After she found him, Milanian called 911 but was disconnected several times before she finally flagged down a motorist, who contacted the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.

While she waited, Milanian said, she tried to comfort him.

“He grabbed my wrist and stopped crying,” Milanian said in a 1998 interview. “It was very emotional. What kind of sick human would do something like that? He still had his umbilical cord hanging from his stomach.”

When two sheriff’s deputies, Darren Harris and Joel Nebel, arrived, they found Milanian on her knees holding the boy. They checked the baby’s vital signs and immediately requested paramedics.

“They took the infant from me. They didn’t wait,” Harris said.

Whitaker’s body temperature had fallen to 80 degrees, and when he arrived at the hospital, he was immediately treated for severe hypothermia. Doctors think the baby’s size — he weighed 7 pounds, 12 ounces — enabled him to survive.

The baby made a remarkable recovery, and at the time, the neonatal medical director at Huntington Memorial Hospital called it “really almost a miracle.” Hospital nurses named him “Baby Christian” and people from around the state, and as far as Florida, sent in toys, gifts, clothes and monetary donations.

A few days later, Milanian went to see the baby, gazing with tears in her eyes as the infant lay sleeping on his belly in an incubator. She did not adopt him herself because she had been on the news and worried someone could easily find him.

Still, Milanian had hoped to maintain contact, and after her visit said she repeatedly reached out to child services to see Whitaker. Finally, after a year of attempts, she was told he had been adopted and she would not be able to see him.

“It was the most frustrating experience,” said Milanian, an Iranian-born American citizen.

After finding Whitaker, she was inspired to start Children of One Planet, a nonprofit organization that helps orphan children around the world. And as the years passed, she waited.

“I was hoping that he would find me, the same way we found each other that day,” Milanian said.

Authorities tried in vain to find the boy’s mother, combing the area with scent dogs and knocking on doors around the neighborhood looking for witnesses, according to a 1998 report from the Sheriff’s Department.

“We believe the mother may be a scared teenager or young adult that simply did not know what to do,” the Altadena Station stated in a flier requesting information on the mother’s identity.

Later that month, detectives received a call from a woman claiming to be the mother. She asked about the charges she might be facing before hanging up. Shortly after, the same woman called the hospital asking about the baby’s welfare, according to the report.

The L.A. County Board of Supervisors put forth a motion to offer a $5,000 reward for anyone who could identify the person who buried the baby.

“Fortunately, there is a happy ending to such a tragic beginning,” the board said in the motion. “A couple has committed to adopting Baby Christian and will care for him and love him as every child deserves to be loved.”

Whitaker grew up in the South Bay, never knowing the story of how he had been found. The only commemoration of that time lay in his middle name: Christian.

His father, who died a few years ago, was in the military and later worked in law enforcement. Whitaker’s mother worked in education and law and has always been fiercely protective of her son.

At volleyball games, the sport Whitaker has played most of his life, his mother was his greatest cheerleader.

It was not until Whitaker was 17 that he learned from a family member that he had been adopted. A year ago, his godmother told the story of how he was found.

Though it surprised him, none of it changed the way he felt about his upbringing.

“I’m here today. I’ve lived a great life. I was adopted into a great family,” Whitaker said. “I couldn’t ask my parents for any more.”

Whitaker studied at Santa Monica and El Camino colleges and plans to study journalism at the University of Arizona. He dreams of becoming an entertainment lawyer or maybe an actor, and now he hopes to help Milanian with her nonprofit.

He doesn’t dwell on the person who left him.

“If this was your best idea, to leave me here, then thanks,” he said, “because you weren’t mentally fit to raise a child.”

The day they reunited, Milanian drove Whitaker to the hiking trail where she found him. As she walked with him, she called him by the name she knows best: Christian.

Whitaker stared through a chain-link fence at the spot. He grew quiet, serious — a change from the jokester he had been all day.

Back in the car, Milanian asked if he was OK.

“This could have been my grave,” Whitaker said.

Milanian sat next to him in the car and said softly, “You were wanted.”

"Horrified by deadly attacks, French Muslims protect church","Horrified by deadly attacks, French Muslims protect church - A group of French Muslims decided to stand guard outside their town’s cathedral to protect it and show solidarity with Catholic churchgoers",1.0,"A group of French Muslims decided to stand guard outside their town’s cathedral to protect it and show solidarity with Catholic churchgoers

PARIS -- As a French-born Muslim, Elyazid Benferhat’s stomach turned when he heard about a deadly Islamic extremist attack on a church in Nice. Then he decided to act.

A self-described man of peace and pragmatism, Benferhat and a friend gathered a group of young Muslim men to stand guard outside their town's cathedral for the All Saints’ holiday weekend, to symbolically protect it and show solidarity with Catholic churchgoers.

Parishioners at the 13th-century church in the southern town of Lodeve were deeply touched. The parish priest said their gesture gave him hope in a time of turmoil.

Benferhat, speaking with a distinctive southern French accent, identified himself as “more French than anything.” While his mother was born in Algeria, he was born in France and grew up speaking only French. “But I am also Muslim ... and we have seen Islamophobia in this country, and terrorism,” he told The Associated Press.

“In recent years, I’ve had a pit in my stomach,” because every time Islamic extremist violence strikes France, he said, French Muslims face new stigmatization, even though “we had nothing to do with it.”

He called the beheading of a teacher near Paris last month — targeted because he showed his class caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad for a debate on free expression — an act of “unbelievable, unprecedented cruelty.”

Then when three people were killed last Thursday in the Notre Dame Basilica in Nice, Benferhat said he was so sickened that he wanted to do something “so that everyone wakes up.”

Benferhat, who works for French oil company Total and coaches at a local football club, talked to a Muslim friend who was in Nice that day, “and we had this idea. We needed to do something beyond paying homage to the victims. We said, we will protect churches ourselves.”

They recruited volunteers among their friends and at his football club, and guarded the church that night and again for Sunday Mass. He said they also coordinated with local police, after France’s government promised to increase security at sensitive religious sites.

“It’s very good, these young people who are against violence,” the cathedral’s priest, the Rev. Luis Iniguez, told the AP.

When a local newspaper published a photo of parishioners posing with their Muslim guards, Iniguez hung it inside the Gothic cathedral, which serves as an anchor for town life. “People were happy to see that,” he said, especially amid recent concerns about tensions between France and the Muslim world, on top of ongoing fears of the virus.

The small-town gesture drew national attention, and with it, online invective from some far-right voices.

But Benferhat said the response has been “90% positive.”

His group is considering how to take the idea forward, and would like to do it again for Christmas, and for other towns to follow Lodeve’s lead. But for now all religious services in France are banned at least until Dec. 1 to try to slow fast-rising virus infections.

Whatever he does next, he says, “it will come from the heart.”",https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/horrified-deadly-attacks-french-muslims-protect-church-74054852
Netherlands opens world's first plastic-free supermarket aisle as UK urged to follow example,Netherlands opens world's first plastic-free supermarket aisle as UK urged to follow example: 'For decades shoppers have been sold the lie that we can’t live without plastic in food and drink'.,1.0,"A “world first” plastic-free supermarket aisle is being unveiled in Amsterdam, prompting calls from campaigners for retailers to roll them out in the UK.

More than 700 products will be available without plastic packaging in the aisle which is being set up in a new metro-sized pilot store of supermarket chain Ekoplaza in the Dutch city, including meat, rice, sauces, dairy, chocolate, cereals, fruit and vegetables.

Environmental campaign group A Plastic Planet, which came up with the idea, said the introduction of the world’s first plastic-free aisle was a “landmark moment” for the global fight against plastic pollution.

A Plastic Planet co-founder Sian Sutherland called for British supermarkets to follow Ekoplaza’s lead and introduce aisles without plastic packaging at the earliest opportunity.

The issue of plastics polluting the oceans, where they can harm and kill wildlife, has shot up the agenda after it was highlighted in the BBC’s flagship nature documentary series Blue Planet II.

✕ Blue Planet shows mourning whales whose newborn may have been killed by plastic

Earlier this year, Prime Minister Theresa May outlined measures to tackle plastic waste in her Government’s 25-year environment plan, including encouraging plastic-free supermarket aisles.

Iceland has pledged to go plastic-free on all its own-brand packaging by 2023.

And a survey for A Plastic Planet revealed last year that more than nine out of 10 British shoppers support the introduction of an aisle in supermarkets that has products free of plastic packaging.

In the Netherlands, Ekoplaza will roll out plastic-free aisles across its 74 branches by the end of this year.

The aisle will be used to test out new compostable bio-materials, as well as using traditional materials including glass, metal and cardboard, the scheme’s backers said.

And goods within the aisle will carry the Plastic Free Mark, a label introduced by A Plastic Planet to help shoppers easily identify products that are completely free of plastic packaging.

Ms Sutherland said: “The introduction of the world’s first plastic-free aisle represents a landmark moment for the global fight against plastic pollution.

“For decades shoppers have been sold the lie that we can’t live without plastic in food and drink. A plastic-free aisle dispels all that.

“Finally we can see a future where the public have a choice about whether to buy plastic or plastic-free. Right now we have no choice.

“There is absolutely no logic in wrapping something as fleeting as food in something as indestructible as plastic.

“Plastic food and drink packaging remains useful for a matter of days yet remains a destructive presence on the earth for centuries afterwards.

“Ekoplaza has set an example that the UK’s supermarkets must follow at the earliest opportunity. Our biggest supermarkets must introduce plastic-free aisles urgently.”

Ekoplaza chief executive Erik Does said: “We know that our customers are sick to death of products laden in layer after layer of thick plastic packaging.

“Plastic-free aisles are a really innovative way of testing the compostable biomaterials that offer a more environmentally friendly alternative to plastic packaging.”

Toyota will replace burnt Tundra as a thank you to brave nurse,Toyota will replace burnt Tundra as a thank you to brave nurse,1.0,"Toyota certainly didn’t have to gift Nurse Allyn Pierce a new truck for his bravery but they’re doing it anyway.

If you’re a Californian, the past few days have been an absolute nightmare as people have been uprooted out of their homes as fires ravage their communities from all sides. But, with all tragedies, heroes are born and Nurse Allyn Pierce was definitely one of them. Even though his Toyota Tundra was literally burnt on all sides, Nurse Pierce drove his Tundra through the fire, back to his post where he and countless numbers of nurses, doctors, and medical professionals assisted those that were left behind in Paradise, Calif.

Nurse Allyn Pierce is OK, but, he lost his home and although his Toyota Tundra still runs and drives, the exterior suffered some serious fire damage.

To say thank you, Toyota USA is gifting him a new Toyota Tundra to replace the one he lost. Check out the amazing story on Twitter below!

Here’s the crazy story of just one of the many heroes in Paradise, the town destroyed by California’s deadliest fire ever. His name is Allyn Pierce, and he’s the badass nurse who drove this truck through the flames. pic.twitter.com/xAL7zRf34H — Jack Nicas (@jacknicas) November 13, 2018

Suddenly a bulldozer appeared & knocked a burning truck next to him out of the way. There was some room to maneuver. But instead of going forward toward safety, he turned around & drove back into the heart of Paradise. Here’s the aftermath of his Tacoma.

Some good news for Allyn: Looks like @Toyota is getting him a new truck. pic.twitter.com/r0gauofHuZ — Jack Nicas (@jacknicas) November 13, 2018

I can only imagine how Nurse Allyn Pierce felt as he thought his life was going to end, and then when he had the opportunity to save himself, decided to help others.

Reading dozens of stories of bravery these past few days I know most of these amazing people say, “I was just doing my job, I’m no hero, it’s what we do.” But on the contrary, they all are heroes the moment they risk their own life to save someone else. If that’s not the definition of a hero, I don’t know what is.

And to Toyota, thanks for being an outstanding example of a way to spread that little bit of good cheer in some truly depressing times. I know some people will say this is a publicity stunt and all but I say it’s setting an example of how other corporations can think of helping in their own way if they can.

If you’re inspired by this story and do want to give, the Pierce family did lose their house and are accepting donations through their GoFundMe below.

Hats off to you, Toyota.",https://tiremeetsroad.com/2018/11/12/toyota-will-replace-burnt-tundra-as-a-thank-you-to-brave-nurse/
Chelsea to send racist fans on Auschwitz trips instead of banning them,Chelsea football club to send racist fans on Auschwitz trips instead of banning them,1.0,"Chelsea want to send racist supporters on trips to the Nazi concentration camp Auschwitz instead of imposing banning orders.

The club’s owner, Roman Abramovich, who is Jewish, is at the forefront of the initiative, designed to tackle antisemitism among fans. Chelsea want to offer supporters caught being racist the chance to attend education courses at the second world war concentration camp in Poland instead of being banned from attending matches at the Premier League club.

“If you just ban people, you will never change their behaviour,” the Chelsea chairman, Bruce Buck, told the Sun. “This policy gives them the chance to realise what they have done, to make them want to behave better.

“In the past we would take them from the crowd and ban them, for up to three years. Now we say: ‘You did something wrong. You have the option. We can ban you or you can spend some time with our diversity officers, understanding what you did wrong.’”

Chelsea publicly criticised a number of their own fans for antisemitic chanting against rivals Tottenham in September 2017.

Buck said: “It is hard to act when a group of 50 or 100 people are chanting. That’s virtually impossible to deal with or try to drag them out of the stadium. But if we have individuals that we can identify, we can act.”

The club sent a delegation to Auschwitz for the annual March of the Living in April, while 150 staff and supporters went on a day trip in June to the site which once housed Nazi death camps while Poland was under German occupation.

Buck said: “The trips to Auschwitz were really important and effective and we will consider more as well as other things that will affect people.”

The Chelsea Supporters’ Trust is in favour of the plan, while the Football Supporters Federation’ also lent support. The campaigns and diversity manager, Anwar Uddin said: “The FSF have long advocated and promoted educational sessions with supporters found to have used discriminatory language. We completely agree with Bruce Buck that simply banning people doesn’t change behaviour or attitudes and applaud Chelsea for being one of the first Premier League clubs to so publicly advocate this approach and hope others follow their example.”

On Wednesday Chelsea previewed a new film at the Houses of Parliament aimed at raising awareness of the consequences of antisemitism, interspersing images of offensive chants and social media posts alongside images from the Holocaust. Buck told the club’s website: “We are just trying to make a dent in the antisemitism in this world. Over time we hope to make a real contribution for good to society.”",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/oct/11/chelsea-to-send-racist-fans-auschwitz-instead-banning-orders-antisemitism
Wildlife poachers in Kenya 'to face death penalty',"In the last five years, Kenya's poaching rates have dropped by 85% for rhinos and 78% for elephants",1.0,"This article has been updated, see note below.*

Wildlife poachers in Kenya will face the death penalty, the country’s tourism and wildlife minister has reportedly announced.

Najib Balala warned the tough new measure would be fast-tracked into law.

Existing deterrents against killing wild animals in the east African nation are insufficient, Mr Balala said, according to China’s Xinhua news agency.

So in an effort to conserve Kenya’s wildlife populations, poachers will reportedly face capital punishment once the new law is passed.

Kenya is home to a wide variety of treasured species in national parks and reserves, including lions, black rhinos, ostriches, hippos, buffalos, giraffe and zebra.

Last year in the country 69 elephants – out of a population of 34,000 - and nine rhinos – from a population of under 1,000 - were killed.

“We have in place the Wildlife Conservation Act that was enacted in 2013 and which fetches offenders a life sentence or a fine of US$200,000,” Mr Balala reportedly said. “However, this has not been deterrence enough to curb poaching, hence the proposed stiffer sentence.""

The move could put Kenya in conflict with the UN, which opposes the death penalty for all crimes worldwide.

UN General Assembly resolutions have called for a phasing-out of capital punishment, and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights advocates its universal abolition.

Kenya’s tourism chiefs say poaching has been on a downward trend largely thanks to enhanced wildlife law-enforcement efforts and investment in conservation.

“These efforts led to an 85 per cent reduction in rhino poaching and a 78 per cent reduction in elephant poaching, respectively, in 2017 compared to when poaching was at its peak in 2013 and 2012 respectively,” the ministry said.

Nevertheless, earlier this month two black rhinos and a calf were poached at Meru national park.

And the losses are still extremely high, virtually cancelling out the overall population’s growth rate, according to the Save the Rhino organisation. The charity points out many other African nations also suffer high rates of poaching.

The report of plans for capital punishment prompted sharply diverging reactions, with some social-media users applauding Kenya and calling it “fantastic news”, and others insisting it should never happen.

Some said authorities should go after kingpin traffickers rather than the “smallest animals in the criminal food chain”.

For years, many people angry at high levels of poaching, linked with lucrative organised crime, have called for the death sentence as a deterrent.

Gangs sell elephant tusks for ivory in the far East, where it is turned into trinkets; rhino horn is believed by some wealthy buyers there to serve as a medicine – even though it is made of keratin, the same substance as human fingernails, so has no health-giving properties.

The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, reposted the Xinhua report, saying “#SeriousAboutWildlifeCrime”.

The Independent has contacted the Kenya Wildlife Service to confirm Mr Balala’s plans and is awaiting a response.

Richard Vigne, head of Kenya’s Ol Pejeta Conservancy that was home to Sudan, the world’s last male northern rhino which was put down in March, said the animal would be remembered for ever as a signal to the world. While Kenya was a global leader in conservation, there are still many species across the planet that faced a similar plight, he said.

* Update: It has come to our attention through an AFP article that the Xinhua news agency was mistaken in its report last year that Kenya’s tourism and wildlife minister had announced plans to introduce the death penalty for wildlife poachers. It appears the minister was not at the meeting on which Xinhua reported. And while a statement was read on his behalf by a colleague, he has told AFP that “nothing I spoke on behalf of the minister was related to the death penalty for poachers”. He went on to say to AFP that “I think in that meeting one of the local leaders casually said that poachers should be killed but nothing official came from the ministry”. The Independent has once again contacted the Kenya Wildlife Service, as well as the Kenyan Ministry of Tourism and Wildlife, for further information. 12/04/19",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/poachers-kenya-wildlife-death-penalty-capital-punishment-najib-balala-a8349966.html?utm_source=The+Crunch&utm_campaign=b053427571-THE_CRUNCH_55_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_aa18ea5b4e-b053427571-408697765

'H‑E‑B has done more for Texas than our own government leadership,' said one Twitter user

H-E-B grocery store in Leander, Texas has gone viral for its act of kindness to families during a severe winter storm which has left many scrambling for food and water after power outages.

The Washington Post reported that H-E-B allowed customers to leave with groceries free of charge. According to Tim Hennessy, 60, there was a “collective groan” on Tuesday when the lights went out while he was standing in a checkout line behind 20 customers.

Once Hennessy reached the cashier, she waved him to move through before thanking him and telling him to drive home safely. “And it hit us — like, wow, they’re just letting us walk out the door,” he said.

Hennessy’s Facebook post about the store’s generosity garnered attention online which ultimately lead to a Friday op-ed in the San Antonio Express-News entitled, “Why H-E-B comes through in a crisis when Texas government doesn’t.”

“We could not believe the generosity of H.E.B. and the kindness of that wonderful gesture. They could just as easily asked us all to leave the store as soon as the power went out and asked us to just leave the groceries in the carts,” Hennessy said to the news outlet.

“This is the America that I know. Despite all the negative we hear/see being reported daily in the news. America and most Americans are still kind, thoughtful, generous, and caring.”

Last good person left in America Dolly Parton donates her 100 millionth book,Dolly Parton donates 100 millionth book to children,1.0,"Between rebuilding Tennessee and making my Spotify playlists so damn good, Dolly Parton has become the unofficial Queen of Good Works.

Today, the country music star heads to Washington to deliver her 100 millionth book donation from her Imagination Library to the Library of Congress. Founded by Parton, the Imagination Library sends free books to children from birth until their start of school, regardless of their parents' income.

Parton started the program in 1995. Less than 10 years later, Parton had donated a million books. After the singer launched operations in Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom, donations started running into the tens of millions.

Parton says her father's illiteracy initially inspired her to take action.

The singer, whose fan base is a mix of Republicans and Democrats, has studiously avoided politics. Parton has nonetheless gained notoriety for her extensive philanthropic efforts.

After fires destroyed homes in Tennessee in 2016, Dolly Parton's My People foundation gave more than $8 million to people affected. Survivors received an average of $10,000 from the charity Participants reported feeling grateful to receive money from the foundation without any stigma or strings attached.

"L.A. County to stop collecting old juvenile detention fees, erasing nearly $90 million of families’ debt","L.A. County to stop collecting old juvenile detention fees, erasing nearly $90 million of families' debt",1.0,"Los Angeles County supervisors voted Tuesday to stop collecting fees once charged to families of juvenile delinquents for their incarceration, ending a practice decried by criminal justice advocates as an unfair tax on minorities and an ineffective means of rehabilitating young people who commit crimes.

The motion, sponsored by Supervisors Hilda Solis and Janice Hahn, directs the county’s Probation Department to stop accepting payment and cancel nearly $90 million in juvenile detention fees assessed before 2009, when the department suspended new fees but continued to collect payment of old ones.

The vote also follows a statewide ban, which took effect Jan. 1, on a range of court costs and fees charged to parents and guardians of children in the juvenile justice system.

Almost every state in the country allows youth or their families to be charged for costs of the youths’ detention, supervision or care while in custody, according to an analysis by the Juvenile Law Center, a public-interest law firm in Philadelphia.

Even after California’s ban, many counties are still collecting payment of previously assessed fees.

“The [state] legislation helps youth and families who haven’t yet experienced fines and fees, but without this kind of move at the county level, children and their families will still be struggling,” said Jessica Feierman, associate director of the Juvenile Law Center.

L.A. County’s move comes amid a national shift in thinking about criminal justice with the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement.

“This is in the context of the post-Ferguson era where there’s a lot more attention to fines and fees in the criminal justice system in general,” Jeffrey Selbin, director of the Policy Advocacy Clinic at UC Berkeley School of Law, said in an interview ahead of the vote. The clinic has extensively studied the use of juvenile fees in California.

Supervisors said Tuesday that collection of the fees no longer makes sense.

“It is simply not worth the cost and effort to the county — and more importantly, not worth the cost to families — to continue with these collection payments,” Solis said.

Before 2009, L.A. County’s Probation Department regularly charged parents and guardians of juvenile delinquents fees for some of the costs associated with their child’s detention. At the time, the fee was $23.63 a day for juvenile halls and $11.94 a day for probation camps. Collection efforts included intercepting state tax refunds, putting liens on property and, in some cases, garnishing wages.

In 2009, in response to pressure from the Youth Justice Coalition and a Times investigation, the Probation Department placed a moratorium on the fees, though it continued to accept payments on pre-2009 bills.

Those payments amounted to just $120,000 in 2017, out of a total of $89 million in outstanding debt across 52,000 accounts, according to the department.

Research shows that juvenile detention fees impose financial hardships and strain on low-income families and weigh disproportionately on black and Latino youth who are overrepresented in the criminal justice system and are often sentenced to longer terms than white youth.

Alberto Penuelas, who served time as a juvenile, recalled the toll his detention fee took on his mother, a single parent who worked in the fields.

“They would call her every Saturday collecting these debts.… She could barely afford to feed us,” he told the board. “I’m hoping that this passes and this doesn’t happen to other families.”

Research also suggests the fees may increase recidivism. A study of more than 1,000 youth in Pennsylvania found that the total amount of fines, fees and/or restitution significantly increased the likelihood of recidivism within two years, even after controlling for demographics and case characteristics.

“The two main purposes of the juvenile justice system are to rehabilitate kids and to protect public safety, and it turns out these fees undermine both of those,” said Selbin of UC Berkeley.

Selbin said L.A. County’s action Tuesday is the largest discharge of such debt anywhere.

“We hope this will be a signal to other counties,” he said.

The dogs bounded into the visit room at the mixed-custody prison for a reunion with their inmate handlers.

It was the first reunion in the five years that the Sequim-based Welfare for Animals Guild has sponsored the dog-training program, which has given more than 200 canines a new leash on life, reported the Peninsula Daily News (https://bit.ly/2dK4KVE).

There may be no better place for bite-prone animals to receive the constant care they need to break out of their own prisons, say inmates, prison officials and WAG organizers.

It’s the perfect setting for dogs that need care 24/7 to let go of their fear and anger, Guild President Barbara Brabant of Sequim said.

The animals stay for weeks or months in the program - however long it takes for them to become whole, she said.

The men who train the animals learn responsibility, acquire a skill they can use outside the prison walls and see their loving touch take hold, said Clallam Bay resident Tanja Cain, prison offender program coordinator, and Correctional Unit Supervisor Michelle Klepps, who grew up in Clallam Bay and lives in Forks.

“This not only changes the dog, it changes the offenders in a positive way,” Klepps said.

Brabant said the animals that lit up the visit room were among the 156 adult dogs and 73 puppies whose lives were turned around by the men who call the mixed-custody facility home.

The inmates, about a dozen among the 900 at Clallam Bay, have trained daily over weeks or months - however long it takes - until the dogs pass an American Kennel Club obedience test.

The AKC will not certify inmates as dog trainers, but WAG is putting together a course under which they would be certified under WAG’s auspices upon leaving prison.

The animals sleep in the inmates’ cells and get taken on regular walks in a special prison yard where men hardened by circumstances and their own bad decisions dutifully scoop up their animals’ poop.

While in the training program, the dogs are tethered by leashes colored red for “don’t touch the animal,” yellow for “ask the handler first before petting” and green for “give the dog all the love you’ve got.”

Participants at the reunion included a dozen inmates who earned participation in the program through good behavior.

About 50 people attended, including about 35 WAG board and group members, and dog owners.

They were on the verge of giving up on their animals before the dogs adopted the inmates as their constant companions.

The dogs, accompanied by their owners, included Sky the Great Pyrenees Husky, Connor the boxer-husky and Skeeter the Chihuahua.

Skeeter was trained by Seattle resident Douglas Gallagher, 56, serving life in prison as a three-strike offender.

After Gallagher, whose third offense was robbery, took in Skeeter, he watched the tiny pup go through two days of seizures before the dog lost its fear, Gallagher said in an interview before testimonials from inmates and dog owners.

“Watching this dog reminded me of how helpless my victims were,” said Gallagher, who has rehabilitated 19 animals.

Gallagher trained another animal who was afraid of that dog toy of all dog toys - a Frisbee.

“Being in a correctional facility is unlike anything in the world,” Gallagher said.

“This has helped a lot in dealing with people, dealing with staff.”

William Friedrichs, 33, of Olympia, is serving 28 years for armed robbery, he said in an interview.

For him, the dog-training program is a path to a plateau he invoked more than once: redemption.

“I feel that through this program, I am being able to top the scales by doing so much more good,” Friedrichs said

“I’m finally creating positive stuff instead of just negative, destructive things.”

“It’s helped with my ability to communicate with others, and I’ve become more compassionate,” Friedrichs said.

“There are not a lot of jobs in here that have that.

“This is a very rewarding job in that sense.”

Most other prison jobs pay 30 cents to 42 cents an hour except for textiles-related correctional industries, where uniforms are made and inmates can earn up to $1.70 an hour.

Inmates in the dog-training program are paid 42 cents an hour, but the wages are capped at $55 a month for taking care of the dogs 24 hours a day.

Connor was an aggressive dog that Friedrichs said he identified with and who Brabant said “was totally not adoptable.”

It took Friedrichs three to four months to train the 85-pound animal.

“Not a bad dog, just an aggressive dog,” Friedrichs said.

“He didn’t want to fight, but it turned into a fight because he didn’t have a better way.

“I spent a lot of time to socially interact, and now he lives a full and happy life.”

Inmates can receive photos of the dogs they’ve trained after they have been returned to their owners.

Friedrichs has since seen photos of Connor playing on a beach, chasing birds, but the pictures inmates receive lack people for safety reasons, Brabant said.

Inmates don’t know where the dogs live, either.

That doesn’t faze Friedrichs, who is proud when he sees dogs he has trained living happy lives.

“You think, ‘Yeah, I did that,’” he said.

During testimonials, Friedrichs sat next to Connor’s owner, Kathy Schock of Sequim.

After Friedrichs’ tutelage, Connor “was a totally different dog,” Schock told the group.

“That’s all because of this guy here.”

Inmate Charles Graves, who trained Sky, has been in the program longer than any other inmate.

The dogs have been abandoned “just like a lot of other people,” he told the gathering.

“The dogs have taught me how to rediscover bonding again.

“I spend more time with these dogs than any person I have in my life.”

Graves recalled having a leashed dog at his side while talking to a friend over a prison phone.

Graves had to tell the dog to stop annoying him.

His friend asked who he was talking to.

“He said, ‘You got a dog? They let you have dogs in prison?’

“He said, ‘What kind of prison you in?’”

Inmate Alan Nord told the group that watching inmates and dogs interact has a positive effect on those observing their give-and-take.

“To see the dudes in this prison that are killers and whatever, they have a puppy, you see the tension in the day room drop dramatically,” he said.

Other state prisons also have dog-training programs, Brabant said, adding that Clallam Bay’s is more rigorous than others.

Cain said WAG volunteers visit every week, conduct training sessions and talk to the handlers.

Prison Superintendent Ronald Haynes said the program has a transformative impact on Clallam Bay’s inmates.

“It kind of takes them away from the prison life and gives them a purpose,” he said.

At the end of the presentation, WAG members, inmates and dog owners were urged to mingle - with a reminder that the setting for all this good cheer was a prison.

“No hugging, just handshakes,” Brabant told the gathering.

After the event the inmates, dressed in neat khaki pants and white T-shirts, returned to their daily lives while visitors waited for the locked visit-room door to open so they could collect keys and wallets secured in the waiting area near the entrance door.

The walkway outside led to an exit gate, past stacked, tubular bales of razor wire several feet away and a closer row of small signs that warned any inmates who could read the signs that if they strayed, lethal force awaited them.

Brabant said WAG and Center Valley Animal Rescue in Quilcene are starting a training program for cats that need to be socialized that’s modeled after the one for dogs.

She said three felines are already being leash- and clicker-trained at Clallam Bay by inmates in the prison’s restrictive closed-custody unit.

“There’s cat guys out there,” Brabant joked.

UK runs without coal power for three days in a row,"The UK has been powered without coal for three days in a row, setting a new record and underlining the polluting fuel’s rapid decline. Demand lower following recent warm weather, making it easier for gas, renewables and nuclear to cover UK’s needs.",1.0,"The UK has been powered without coal for three days in a row, setting a new record and underlining the polluting fuel’s rapid decline.

Coal has historically been at the cornerstone of the UK’s electricity mix, but last year saw the first 24-hour period that the the country ran without the fuel since the 19th century.

New records were broken last week when zero power came from coal for nearly 55 consecutive hours.

That milestone in turn was smashed on Monday afternoon and the UK passed the 72-hour mark at 10am on Tuesday. The coal-free run came to an end after 76 hours.

Without the fossil fuel, nearly a third of Britain’s electricity was supplied by gas, followed by windfarms and nuclear on around a quarter each.

The rest came from biomass burned at Drax power station in North Yorkshire, imports from France and the Netherlands, and solar power. Drax said it expected to go without coal on Tuesday.

The coal-free records are a reversal from the recent highs that coal plant owners experienced during the so-called “beast from the east” cold snap.

During cold weather in February and early March, demand for gas to use in heating pushed up the price of gas for power, which brought coal power stations online.

However, overall power demand is now much lower following the recent warm weather, making it easier for gas, renewables and nuclear to cover much of the UK’s needs.

Guardian business email sign-up

National Grid has forecast electricity demand this summer will be lower than last year, with minimum demand at 17GW and peak at 33.7GW. Demand on Tuesday is expected to peak at about 35GW.

Experts said to expect more milestones this year. “Ever rising renewable capacity in the UK will see these records fall more and more frequently, clearly showing progress made over the past decade or two,” said Jonathan Marshall, an analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit.

However, one observer cautioned that the shift away from coal could be a “false dawn” if it was just replaced by gas.

Andrew Crossland, who tracks electricity generation on the MyGridGB site, said: “Shifting to gas is likely to make our electricity market more volatile as our energy price becomes increasingly locked to international gas markets. That will only hurt consumers.”

A carbon tax, the cheaper price of gas and the rise of renewables have all hit coal operators. The government has set a deadline of October 2025 for phasing out coal entirely.

Two coal plant owners have said they will shut this year, which will leave the UK with six coal power stations including Drax, which has hinted it will cease burning coal before the 2025 target.",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/apr/24/uk-power-generation-coal-free-gas-renewables-nuclear

(Photo: Coeo Labs/Twitter)

An Indian engineer whose low-cost neonatal breathing device has saved the lives of newborn babies across small towns of India, has won the 2019 Commonwealth Secretary-General's Innovation for Sustainable Development Award in London.

Nitesh Kumar Jangir, who created Saans as a breathing support device to tackle avoidable deaths of premature babies from respiratory distress syndrome due to a lack of immediate access to complex medical equipment, received his award in the People category alongside 14 other innovators from across the 53 member-countries of the Commonwealth.

""Our mission is to try and ensure that babies don't lose their lives due to the lack of access to a piece of technology,"" said Jangir, who was presented the award at a ceremony in London last week by Prince Harry the Youth Ambassador of the Commonwealth, and Commonwealth Secretary-General Baroness Patricia Scotland.

""In countries like India, with erratic electricity supply and limited resources at public hospitals, this neonatal breathing support equipment can be used without any complex training. So, anyone, anywhere can use this device and deliver crucial support to premature babies,"" he explained.

""This award will go a long way in upscaling this device across the Commonwealth countries, for use in similar conditions in regions like Africa,"" he said.

It's a wonderful feeling when a doctor writes to you and tells you that your device saved the life of a neonate. Thank you, everyone, who is supporting our cause. @BIRAC_2012 @gatesfoundation @CCAMP_Bangalore @ficci_india @OlsonKristian1 @CAMTechMGH @AbhaySinghKr @MADevImpac pic.twitter.com/aXjJcytZIu Coeo Labs (@CoeoLabs) November 14, 2018

Who is Nitesh Kumar Jangir?

The Bangalore-based electronics engineer is the co-founder of Coeo Labs, a medical device company with a vision to prevent preventable deaths in the field of emergency and critical care.

Saans, which has been in circulation for the past three months across district hospitals of India that lack neonatal ICU facilities as well as at medical colleges, has been in development for four years.

It is the world's first neonatal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) device that can be powered in multiple ways through direct source electricity, including a vehicle's electrical supply, a rechargeable battery, compressed gas, or even manual air pumping.

While this device is low-cost, at least three times cheaper than any other such machine, we had to ensure that it was of high quality.

About the Commonwealth Innovation Awards

""The response from every part of the Commonwealth has been phenomenal,"" said Abhik Sen, Head of Innovation and Partnerships at the Commonwealth Secretariat.

""By showcasing the contribution their innovations are making towards building a better world, these awards will help our hitherto unsung heroes win that crucial next round of support, mentoring and investment they need to scale up and fulfil their dreams,"" he said.

""Equally, these awards are intended to inspire the incredibly youthful population of Commonwealth countries to dream big and believe that no problem is too big to solve through innovation,"" he added.

Each of the 15 winners of the inaugural Commonwealth Innovation Awards receive a trophy, a certificate and 2,000 pounds in prize money.

The innovation awards are divided along five thematic categories -- improving the lives of people; boosting prosperity; protecting the planet, promoting peace; and building partnerships for development in the Commonwealth.

The selection process was based on the impact or potential of the innovations to advance one or more of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals in Commonwealth countries and some of the other winners came from countries in the Caribbean and Africa and from Australia and Canada.

"Texas lawmaker files bill to raise minimum teacher salary to $70,000","Texas lawmaker files bill to raise minimum teacher salary to $70,000",1.0,"AUSTIN, Texas (KOSA) - State Representative James Talarico (D-Round Rock) has filed a bill to help support teachers across Texas.

House Bill 3580 would raise the minimum salary for teachers to $70,000 a year.

Rep. Talarico explained his reasoning for the bill in a series of Tweets.

“When I was a public school teacher, I struggled to make ends meet. My coworkers drove Ubers at night and sold their blood plasma for extra money. Today I filed a bill mandating a minimum salary of $70,000 for every teacher in Texas. #txlege”

“Our teachers have endured a global pandemic, an economic collapse, and a deadly winter storm. They held our communities together through these historic crises. Teachers had our backs. Now we must have theirs.”

Rep. Talarico says he chose $70,000 because “Research indicates a $70,000 - $75,000 salary is the baseline income needed for emotional well-being.”

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday launched a $2.5 billion project to electrify all of the country’s households by the end of 2018.

More than 40 million households - about a quarter of all in the country - are yet to be electrified and about 300 million of India’s 1.3 billion people are still not hooked up to the grid.

The states will need to complete the electrification by December 2018 and the government will identify those eligible for free electricity connections across the country.

“No fee will be charged for electricity connection in households of poor citizens,” Modi said at an event where he launched the project.

The project, which will be mostly funded by the federal government and run by the state-run Rural Electrification Corp Ltd, also aims to cut use of kerosene, the government said.

The pledge to provide power could face challenges as it remains difficult to provide electricity in remote towns and villages. The government said it would distribute solar power packs with a battery bank to un-electrified households in such areas.

Another challenge will be to fix finances of debt-laden power distribution companies in states that struggle to buy and supply electricity to consumers.

Ashok Khurana, director general of industry body Association of Power Producers, said the government must take steps to improve the financial health of such companies if the new programme is to be a success.",https://in.reuters.com/article/india-power/india-unveils-2-5-billion-plan-to-electrify-all-households-by-end-2018-idINKCN1C029S
"Retired firefighter-paramedic spends savings on naloxone, gives it away for free","Instead of Buying New Car, Retired Paramedic Spends $40K on Overdose Prevention Kits, gives them away for free, and had Already Saved 94 Lives",1.0,"This article, originally published Oct. 26, 2017, has been updated with current information

By News Staff

PALM CITY, Fla. — A retired firefighter-paramedic is giving away free naloxone to help fight the opioid epidemic.

WPTV reported that Luis Garcia is using his own savings to buy naloxone doses and hand them out to employees of local businesses that could potentially encounter a drug overdose.

According to the Daytona Beach News-Journal, Garcia has purchased 800 doses of naloxone to distribute across the state as part of his South Florida Opioid Crisis Mortality Reduction Project.

Not only does Garcia hand out the doses, he also gives a 90-minute CPR, AED and naloxone class to instruct the employees on how to respond to an overdose situation.

“I witnessed the AIDS crisis and the cocaine crisis. We’re going to find that the opioid pandemic in the USA will far exceed the number of deaths from all of that combined,” Garcia said. “Virtually all these deaths are preventable. Many would live to go into recovery if only someone was there to give them Narcan.”

Garcia also works to change the way addicts are viewed.

“I really believe every human life is worth saving,” he said. “Misconceptions and negative thinking about others makes it harder to fight this crisis.”

A miracle mum has donated 5,000 pints of her own breast milk to help premature babies and gay dads feed their newborns.

Elisabeth Anderson-Sierra, 29, spends an incredible 10 hours a day pumping around 1.75 gallons of milk - ten times the average woman.

Selfless Elizabeth has been diagnosed with hyperlactation syndrome, which means she produces masses more milk than what is considered a 'normal' amount.

But she still manages to squeeze in feeding time for her own six-month-old daughter Sophia, before generously giving the rest to those more needy than herself.

After donating the precious liquid to mums who struggle to breast feed, premature babies and gay dads, Elizabeth says she has fed thousands of babies.

Her milk is packaged, labelled and stored in four huge freezers in the house where she lives with the girls and her husband, public safety officer David Sierra, 52.

The former U.S. Coast Guard, of Beaverton, Oregon, says producing the ""liquid gold"" is her ""labor of love"".

Elizabeth, also mum to two-year-old Isabella, said: ""I realised I was an overproducer when I was pregnant with my first child, but when I had my second baby my supply ramped up.

""Now Sophia is six months old I pump five times a day - as soon as I wake up, after breakfast, after lunch, after dinner and again at midnight.

""I produce 70 to 80oz of milk during my first pump alone.

""In total I will spend around five hours a day just pumping and then with storing, labelling, sterilizing etcetera, I easily spent eight to ten hours.

""Pumping is not fun - it is uncomfortable and it hurts - but it is my labor of love.

""I've not had a day off in two-and-a-half years. It's more than a full-time job.

""It is instant gratification when I donate locally because I see the babies and I see them thriving.

""It will have helped thousands of children. The milk at the milk bank goes to micro pre-emies, so 1oz can feed three or four babies.

""I don't discriminate - I have donated to gay couples and to mothers who are on medication or had their breast removed due to breast cancer.

""It's an amazing feeling.""

Elisabeth usually breastfeeds at home but will also pump discretely in restaurants, while driving and in other public spaces.

Around half of her milk is picked up from her house by local moms or couples who often choose to compensate her for her time.

The other half is donated to California milk bank Prolacta Bioscience.

Elisabeth is paid $1, around 76p, an ounce by the company to cover her time but does not profit.

She spends the money on the equipment, storage and extra food she needs to produce.

The devoted mom said: ""Donating has been a massive part of my life for the past few years.

""When I first started it was very very hard, mostly because there is really no price on it and all the blood sweat and tears that go into making it.

""It was like giving away a portion of the paintings on the Sistine Chapel... priceless and hours of work.

""There was also fear. What if I gave away all my milk and something happened to me to where I then dried up and couldn't feed my own baby?

""I'd hear horror stories about that happening to mothers all the time! I'd then be the one in the position that I'd be desperate to find donor milk.

""I eventually got over it, and kept donating everything I had on hand.

""It makes me feel like I am giving back to my community and I'm participating in humanity.

""I would encourage other mums to reach out to their own community and consider donating.

""Breastmilk is like liquid gold - it should never be thrown away. And there is a high need for it out there.""",http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/miracle-mum-donates-5000-pints-10880072
'I don't want tension': Indian boxer beats China rival then offers belt back to heal border rift,An Indian boxer won a title fight against a Chinese opponent then offered to hand back the prize as a gesture of peace between the two nations which are locked in a territorial dispute in the Himalayas.,1.0,"An Indian boxer won a title fight against a Chinese opponent before offering to hand back the prize as a gesture of peace between the two nations which are locked in a territorial dispute in the Himalayas.

Vijender Singh beat Zulpikar Maimaitiali on points on Saturday to retain his WBO Asia Pacific super middleweight title and take his opponent’s WBO Oriental super middleweight belt.

After the unanimous verdict in Mumbai, Singh hugged Bollywood star Amitabh Bachchan and other celebrities before returning to the ring, taking the microphone and saying: “I don’t want this title. I will give it back to Zulpikar.”

He added: “I don’t want tension on the border. It’s a message of peace. That’s important.”

The gesture follows a stand-off in a remote frontier region beside the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan that has become increasingly tense. On Thursday, China demanded India immediately remove troops from the border, accusing it of building up troops and repairing roads along its side of the border next to the Indian state of Sikkim.

The neighbours share a 3,500km frontier, large parts of which are disputed. Indian officials say about 300 soldiers from either side are facing each other about 150 metres (yards) apart on the plateau.

The current standoff began on 16 June when a column of Chinese troops accompanied by construction vehicles and road-building equipment began moving south into what Bhutan considers its territory.

Bhutan, a small kingdom with close military and economic ties to India, requested assistance from Delhi, which sent forces to resist the Chinese advance.

To avoid escalation, frontline troops in the area do not generally carry weapons, and the Chinese and Indian troops reportedly clashed by “jostling”: bumping chests, without punching or kicking, in order to force the other side backwards.

At the heart of the dispute are different interpretations of where the “trijunction” – the point where the three countries’ borders meet – precisely lies. China argues its territory extends south to an area called Gamochen, while India says Chinese control ends at Batanga La, further to the north.

About 3,000 troops from both countries are reportedly stationed near Doka La , an area initial media reports said was about 15km from Gamochen, but which satellite imagery shows could be as close as two to three kilometres away.

Sherman was given the honor by the NFLPA on Nov. 22 for his charity work through his two organizations -- Richard Sherman Family Foundation and Blanket Coverage Foundation.

Principal Stan Garber posted the news on the school's website on Tuesday along with a photograph he took posing with Sherman. ""Richard’s gesture created such goodwill for the 49ers that they went on to sack Aaron Roger’s and the Green Bay Packers the next day on national TV by a score of 37-8,"" wrote Garber. ""Go 49ers, Go Richard Sherman.""

""It's the most generous thing to happen for these kids, there's plenty in need and he didn't neglect them, it was the perfect way to give back and help them,"" Garber told ABC News on Thursday about the 60 students that will benefit from Sherman's contribution. ""It was the kindest most generous gesture.""

Garber said the middle school is the closest to Levi's Stadium and praises the 49ers organization for continuing to give back to the community since their arrival to town five years ago.

This wasn't the only school that had their debt cleared by Sherman.

Last month, Sherman wrote a check for over $20,000 to the Tacoma Public Schools in Tacoma, Washington, to relieve their student's lunch debt, according to a press release issued by NFLPA.

Since 2013, Sherman has raised $1.5 million and ""helped more than 70,000 people in carrying out their mission of providing students in low-income communities with school supplies and clothing so they can more adequately achieve their goals,"" wrote Brandon Parker, NFLPA's communications manager.

ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (WPVI) -- A Good Samaritan was honored in Atlantic City for helping to make peace between two teenagers, who were literally in the middle of a street fight.The video of Ibn Ali Miller encouraging the young men to talk and shake hands has been seen around the world on social media, and Wednesday it got the attention of city council members.While many people were praising him for breaking up a fight, he used his moment in the spotlight to honor someone else - his mother.""People get 15 minutes of fame a lot, and I would like to use every second of the 15 minutes to send gratitude to my mother,"" said Miller.Choking back tears, he gave credit to his mother during Wednesday night's council meeting.The actions of the 26-year-old, caught on camera, were seen more than 28 million times on Facebook.Actions he says are a reflection of how his mom, Sabrina Winters, raised him.""When we were young, she'd put pretzel sticks across the table. She said those pretzel sticks are the right path, and the rest of the table is the wrong path, and that it's very, very difficult to stay on the right path,"" said Miller.""One thing I always told them in making decisions is think about the best thing that can happen and worst thing that can happen, because either side has consequences,"" said Winters.Praise also came from basketball superstar Lebron James and new Philadelphia Eagle Torrey Smith.The two teens in the video - Sheldon Ward and Jamar Mobley - also thanked Miller for stopping their brawl.""A couple days ago,I was thinking it was cool to fight in front of my friends or I need this fame, but it really doesn't mean nothing at all, so I want to say thank you again,"" said Mobley.""I hope that this is something that will influence people to do more character building, because that's what these young kids need, they need character building,"" said Miller.------",http://6abc.com/news/good-samaritan-caught-on-camera-breaking-up-fight-honored-in-ac/1813971/

Princess Adila bint Abdullah Al-Saud, a known advocate of women’s right to drive, women’s health awareness and women’s legal rights, held a talk about the kingdom’s heritage.

Princess Reema bint Bandar bin Sultan, the president’s undersecretary for the female section at the General Authority for Sports, spoke on the importance of sports in the lives of Saudi women.

The event saw activities for women only, but families were welcome to attend outdoor activities for the younger ones.

Mohammed Al Saif, general supervisor of the King Fahd Cultural Centre, told Arab News that Saudi Arabia wants to “celebrate the Saudi woman and her successful role, and remind people of her achievements in education, culture, medicine, literature and other areas”.

While women’s rights are a controversial topic in Saudi Arabia, Al Saif mentioned that there were no attempts to stop the event by any party.

Al Saif expressed his gratitude for the “heartwarming support and encouragement”.

Changes are already being made

The conservative nation looks set to undergo several reforms as part of Vision 2030, its post-oil economy plans.

Indeed, some changes have already been made in the field of women’s rights, with a ban on women voting or taking part in elections lifted in 2015, and in 2016 the strict religious police were stripped of their power to stop, question, pursue or arrest people.

The hope is to make the region a more modern, tourist-friendly destination by 2030, and subsequently there have been several calls from prominent figures to lift the controversial driving ban.

There have also been requests to lift strict labour laws, along with a landmark petition asking the government to do away with the male guardianship law.

The government also have plans to increase the percentage of women in the nation’s workforce from 23 per cent to 28 per cent by 2020.

Persistence has paid off for a stray dog who refused to stop turning up to a car dealership – after he was adopted and simultaneously landed his dream job.

The lonely pooch kept going to a Hyundai Prime branch in Brazil, and after staff fell in love with him they decided to adopt him and put him to work.

Newly-named Tucson Prime is now in charge of meeting and greeting customers to the dealership, and he couldn't be happier.

According to Bored Panda, one night when it was particularly rainy, manager Emerson Mariano invited the pooch inside and let him have some food and water.

But he kept coming back after that, so staff at the dealership adopted him.

Tucson Prime's 'very caring and docile nature' gave managers an idea and now he's a fully-fledged employee.

Emerson Mariano told media outlet Top Motors Brazil: ""After all, the company has always been pet friendly, so now, we decided to embrace this idea in practice too, having our own pet precisely at a more complicated time like this with so many abandoned animals.""

Tucson Prime has also become a star on Instagram, and already has more than 108,000 followers.

A recent post on the account said: ""Today my day started early, but it was not in sales, I am trying to read and answer the thousands, I swear, miles of messages I received in the last few days.

""But where I came from, I didn't have this technology. Me and my humans are still trying to find a way to deal with so much love and affection like that. If I didn't open your message or answered, I wanted to apologise, but we are trying our best to open all messages to try to thank you all, I am very happy with all this!""",https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/stray-dog-who-visited-car-22504347
Coronavirus-Pandemie: Bosch erfindet eigenen Covid-19-Schnelltest,German company Bosch produces 95% accurate test with testing time under 2.5 hours and no laboratory required,1.0,"Schneller und sicherer auf das Virus testen – der deutsche Traditionskonzern Bosch will mit einem neuen, vielversprechenden Angebot auf den Markt.

Der Autozulieferer Bosch hat auch eine kleine Sparte Medizintechnik, und von dort kommt eine überraschende Nachricht: Bosch hat einen Schnelltest für Corona-Infektionen entwickelt. Innerhalb von zweieinhalb Stunden kann damit eine Infektion festgestellt werden, und zwar direkt vor Ort, ohne Transportwege, die Zeit und Geld kosten.

Susanne Preuß Wirtschaftskorrespondentin in Stuttgart. Folgen Ich folge





„Mit dem Covid-19-Schnelltest wollen wir einen Beitrag zur möglichst raschen Eindämmung der Corona-Pandemie leisten. Infizierte Patienten können schneller identifiziert und isoliert werden“, sagt der Bosch-Vorstandsvorsitzende Volkmar Denner: „Im Kampf gegen das Virus ist Zeit einer der entscheidenden Faktoren. Eine zuverlässige, schnelle Diagnose direkt vor Ort ohne Umwege – das ist der große Vorteil unserer Lösung.“ (Lesen Sie hier ein exklusives Interview mit dem Bosch-Vorstandsvorsitzenden zum neuen Schnelltest.)

Während Schnelltests auf Corona-Infektionen bisher im Ruf stehen, sehr ungenau zu sein, ist bei Bosch davon die Rede, dass in diversen Labortests Ergebnisse mit einer Genauigkeit von mehr als 95 Prozent erzielt worden seien. „Der Schnelltest erfüllt die Qualitätsstandards der Weltgesundheitsorganisation WHO“, heißt es in einer Mitteilung von Bosch.

Die Probe wird mittels Abstrich-Tupfer aus Nase oder Rachen entnommen und in eine Kartusche gegeben, die schon alle für den Test erforderlichen Reagenzien enthält. Diese Kartusche wird sofort in das Analyse-Gerät eingeführt, das nach Bosch-Angaben so anwenderfreundlich gestaltet ist, dass kein besonders geschultes Personal notwendig ist.

Innerhalb von 24 Stunden könnten bis zu zehn Tests pro Gerät durchführt werden. Von den Analysegeräten gibt es bisher einige Dutzend in verschiedenen Laboren und im Robert-Bosch-Krankenhaus in Stuttgart. Für die Produktion der Geräte stehen Kapazitäten bei Bosch am Medizintechnik-Standort in Waiblingen zur Verfügung, heißt es.

Der neue Test wird ab April zunächst in Deutschland erhältlich sein. Bosch prüfe aktuell, wie es Ärzte und Pflegepersonal in medizinischen Einrichtungen unterstützen kann, damit diese sich zeitnah testen lassen können, um möglichst lange einsatzfähig zu bleiben, heißt es in der Mitteilung des Stuttgarter Konzerns.

Das Besondere des Tests ist, dass mit derselben Probe neben Covid-19 auch noch neun weitere Atemwegserkrankungen wie Influenza A und B untersucht werden. „Durch die Differenzial-Diagnostik ersparen sich die Ärzte zusätzlich die Zeit für weitere Tests, erhalten rasch eine fundierte Diagnose und können daraus schneller eine geeignete Therapie einleiten“, wird Marc Meier, Geschäftsführer der Bosch Healthcare Solutions GmbH in der Mitteilung zitiert. Bosch hat bei der Entwicklung des Schnelltests mit dem nordirischen Medizintechnik-Unternehmen Randox Laboratories Ltd. kooperiert.

Bei den Kosten für Geräte und Tests sieht sich Bosch in etwa auf dem Niveau anderer Tests. Demnach kostet jede Kartusche (und damit jeder Test) einen hohen zweistelligen Eurobetrag, jedes Analysegerät einen niedrigen fünfstelligen Betrag.",https://www.faz.net/aktuell/wirtschaft/digitec/coronavirus-pandemie-bosch-erfindet-eigenen-covid-19-schnelltest-16697237.html
Want to quit your job and start a true crime podcast? Obscura's host did it.,People are quitting their boring day jobs and finding success hosting podcasts with zero broadcast experience.,1.0,"VALRICO — It was a Monday afternoon in the Tampa suburbs, all cul-de-sacs and overturned tricycles baking in the sun. In the two-car garage of the three-bedroom house with the tree swing, there was talk of murder.

Justin Drown, host of Obscura: A True Crime Podcast, keeps it cold as a morgue in there. The garage is a converted family room with a couch, a TV and scattered kids toys. It's where Drown, 30, records and edits each episode of his show, looking back at an often grisly, real-life crime.

Drown has recounted infamous cases such as the murder of Ennis Cosby, and Gary Ridgeway, the ""Green River Killer,"" but focuses mostly on the obscure. A recent episode told the tale of Gertrude Baniszewski, the ""skeleton lady"" who took in a teenager in 1960s Indianapolis before enlisting her own children and some neighborhood kids in the girl's torture.

Sitting on Drown's desk was a microphone and an autopsy report for Iana Kasian, a lawyer and model scalped by her graphic novelist fiance (Episode 37, the West Hollywood Vampire). There was a book titled Profitable Podcasting and stickers featuring Obscura's logo, a yawning skull with crime scene tape threaded through its teeth. Drown sends the stickers, and occasionally one of those autopsy reports, as thank-you gifts to the more than 500 fans signed up to donate $5 a month via Patreon, a crowd-funding site.

Whatever Drown is doing seems to be working. Obscura had 45,000 downloads in the final week of May and, a year in, his audience keeps growing. The podcast earns him around $5,000 to $6,000 a month, partly from donations but mostly from traditional advertising. If things continue to snowball, Drown could have a bona fide hit on his hands.

A year ago he was a dropout from nursing school, creatively unfulfilled, working as an overnight security guard at Port Tampa Bay. He'd sit alone in the dark guarding some desolate warehouse ""where nobody ever came, but they were required to have a security guard there because it was in some contract or something."" He listened to true crime podcasts to pass the time.

Now his email in-box is so flooded with messages from fans that he can't respond to them all. And the side effects of constantly being exposed to depravity? The freedom and creativity outweigh that stuff, at least for now.

Despite his grave vocal delivery on the show and a promotional photo in which his face is hidden in shadows, Drown does not seem to be a dark soul, maybe just a little serious. In person, he comes off as a warmhearted, thoughtful homebody, who gets joy from hanging out with his family, including a stepdaughter and 2-year-old step-grandson who live with them. He is fond of labeling himself with the hashtag #younggrandpa.

He listens to jazz while he works. He watches live video games and movies with his wife, Rebecca, but not too many horror flicks.

He consumes no true crime when he's not working, but work is always waiting.

Obscura is part of a vast and fast-growing constellation of true crime audio, ranging from prestige journalism by some of the nation's top news organizations to homegrown fare from amateurs taking advantage of podcasting's low barriers to entry.

For every slickly produced Serial or Dirty John or Peabody Award-winning In the Dark, there are indie shows created by bedroom upstarts like Drown with zero journalism or broadcast experience.

Among them are shows such as Killafornia Dreaming, Murderous Minors, Criminology and Southern Fried True Crime, started by a preschool teacher, a baker, a salesman and an accountant, respectively.

Jami Rice, who worked in commercial real estate, started Murderish as a way to share her experience as a juror. Stephen Pacheco left a job in logistics for a large retail chain a year and a half after launching Trace Evidence. The host of Swindled, known only as ""A Concerned Citizen,"" was searching for a particular type of true crime show. Realizing he could make it himself, he eventually left a ""cushy"" government job as a financial analyst with benefits for a significant, and mostly fan-supported, podcast income.

The indie hosts share a community, gathering online and at events such as the True Crime Podcast Festival in Chicago, and in many cases share an audience. Many recall a childhood spent watching Unsolved Mysteries and Forensic Files or perusing used bookstores for true crime paperbacks.

All say their shows, with weekly downloads numbering in the thousands or tens of thousands, make money. Most have been able to leave their day jobs. Becoming rich is suddenly a real possibility.

Indianapolis Crime Stoppers volunteer Ashley Flowers started recording Crime Junkie in her home office with a childhood friend producing and her brother editing. It recently jumped into the top 10 podcasts on iTunes, and now gets more than 8 million downloads a month. It could generate millions of dollars.

It's tough to say how many of the hundreds of thousands of active podcasts in existence are devoted to true crime, but it's definitely an outsized amount, said Nicholas Quah, who writes about the podcast industry for New York magazine and his newsletter Hot Pod. He calls true crime the ""bloody, beating heart of podcasting.""

This week, for example, 12 of the top 20 shows on Apple's Podcasts app are true crime, including Man in the Window, Crime Junkie, The Shrink Next Door, Monster Presents: Insomniac and My Favorite Murder.

There are many theories on why people like true crime, which is most popular with women. Drown said more than 80 percent of his listeners are women.

Perhaps it's because women are much more likely to be the victim of crime perpetrated by an intimate partner, a common theme in true crime shows.

Perhaps it allows people to experience powerful emotions of fear and horror in a controlled environment.

Perhaps listening releases adrenaline, and it becomes addictive. Perhaps it's natural human fascination with taboo subjects. Perhaps we can't look away because we evolved to pay attention to what might harm us. Perhaps it provides a sense of control in a chaotic world. Perhaps it's a comfort for people who have survived abuse or violence — a way of feeling heard.

""A lot of fans are people with a history of abuse,"" Drown said. ""I've had people reach out and say listening makes them feel better, like a coping mechanism. I had a lot of abuse growing up. That's probably why I'm interested in it.""

That abuse, he said, came at the hands of a family member who heard voices that said young Drown was the Antichrist, which led to beatings and sexual molestation.

""Some people, they see true crime, and they would think, like, why would anybody be into that?"" he said. ""But surprisingly, for some of us that are into it, it's a comfort. You know, it's, you're not going through this life alone kind of thing.""

The genre has always been extremely popular in all forms of media, from sober news reporting to sensational tabloids to big-budget docuseries on HBO and Netflix.

The anyone-can-do-it nature of podcasting, Quah said, has been the big difference. Often it is those ""shaggy"" indie types that garner highly engaged fan communities.

""There's a real conspiratorial power that podcasts can bring, when it's a guy in their basement. It feels like a very intimate form of the internet.""

But they can be problematic. While there are many ""thoroughly reported, ethically minded investigations, such as In the Dark,"" there are also ""these smaller shops"" where amateurs and hobbyists come in.

Quah points to the extremely popular Up and Vanished, which started as an investigation of a 12-year-old cold case of a missing Georgia beauty queen and ended with two arrests last year. It was created by ""an aspiring documentarian, and he arguably, accidentally, helped solve that case, but in doing so he handled facts in ways that are slightly unethical or dubious at best.""

Drown mostly stays away from unsolved mysteries due to such complications. Early on, he did an episode about a California desert city where people go missing.

""I have a pretty good feeling for who did it,"" he said, ""but I can't say.""

He also has strong feelings about the type of people who should be making true crime content. He has sparred publicly and privately with South Florida's Mike Boudet, the controversial former host of the hit series Sword and Scale, which has a similar format to Obscura.

Drown was a fan who was inspired by Sword and Scale and even moderated the show's Reddit page at one time. Now he says he recognizes the nuance ""and certain level of decorum and empathy a person should have"" if they're going to cover such sensitive topics.

Prominent podcast company Wondery cut ties with Sword and Scale recently, a day after Boudet was called out for posting a misogynistic and violent joke on International Women's Day. Some fans of Obscura have pointed to the show as the antidote for Sword and Scale listeners seeking an alternative.

Debates over true crime usually come back to this core question: Is it okay to be entertained by the worst thing that ever happened to someone?

In an essay for Vulture that doesn't answer that question definitively, writer Alice Bolin said that, in the end, she prefers obviously lowbrow fare like Dateline and the Investigation Discovery network over prestige true crime like Serial and Making a Murderer. While both can cause harm, prestige true crime is less enjoyable, she wrote, and ""in its dignified guise, has maybe only perfected a method of making us feel less gross about consuming real people's pain for fun.""

Drown doesn't skimp on graphic details culled from interviews, court documents and archive audio. Episode 34, about a young man who detailed his dark fetishes in horribly candid online videos, is literally gag-inducing. Audio from those videos is part of the episode. People thought the man's stories were just attention-grabbing exaggerations. Then the man was convicted of molesting his stepsister and sentenced to 40 years.

Drown has his own code of ethics. He finds a lot of true crime stuff too sensational. In the garage, he played a clip of Dr. Phil interviewing a murderer about what sound a hammer made on a skull as an example. But what he dislikes even more is when criminals are made more palatable for entertainment, sometimes to the point where they look ""cool.""

""So many podcasts and TV shows are made in awe of these killers,"" he said. ""So many movies are made that reduce what these people did. Probably the most accurate serial killer movie I've ever seen is Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, but even then they just took the edge off the blade. By the end you almost feel sympathetic for him.

""Unintentionally, a lot of people have created antiheroes out of some of these serial killers over time. You know, Charles Manson, Ted Bundy, they sell them on shirts and shot glasses, which grosses me out. And that's because people don't really understand what's happening in these cases. And so I actually think those details are important.""

He said he takes care to tell the victims' stories. To celebrate Obscura's one-year anniversary, Episode 50 was a remake of Episode 1, about Mona Biddy, a disabled child found dead in a Jackson, Miss., reservoir in the early 1970s and the case against her stepmother. The original didn't ""honor the memory of the victim."" In the end, he said, he just wants to ""expose terrible realities, that exist.""

Fans who donate get special access to Obscura's ""black label"" content, which Drown feels the need make without the help of the freelance writers or researchers who work on Obscura. Those are the episodes so dark he's afraid to ask anyone else to work on them, or even upload them to iTunes, where people might stumble on them for free.

""I'm really not a fan of creating them. I actually spend a lot of time telling people not to listen to those,"" Drown said. ""But I think I've covered some really important subjects nobody is talking about.""

He has done black label episodes on rape on porn sets and the industry around fetish videos that involve extreme animal cruelty.

Drown, a man who spent most of the year immersed in the worst side of humanity, said it has been the best year of his life since he was a teenager. But he sometimes feels the effects.

""I'm fine though,"" he said. ""If or when I feel like I can't handle it anymore, then I'll take a break.""

He has has occasionally had sleepless nights and haunting images he can't get out of his mind. For all the gory details he does include, he's also the filter for everything that gets edited out. He sees the crime scene photos, whether you hear about them or not.

How a puppy snatched from a Mesquite yard got home and what it cost the man who returned it,UPDATE: The puppy that was stolen has been returned home safely.,1.0,"Updated at 9:25 a.m. Friday: Revised to reflect details about the puppy's return.

Police say a mastiff puppy that two men took from a Mesquite yard has been returned to its owner — after a man who later purchased the dog realized it was stolen.

The theft happened Saturday afternoon and was captured on surveillance video, which has been viewed online hundreds of thousands of times.

Chipper the French mastiff (Facebook)

Officials said Wednesday night that the investigation into the theft suspects was ongoing. But Chipper, a 10-week-old French mastiff, is home, the dog's owner wrote on Facebook.

Bryan Vazquez told KXAS-TV (NBC5) that he paid $300 for the puppy and had no idea it was the subject of a police search until his wife saw the video online.

""It feels good to have returned the dog and to have everything for the dog to be back where it belongs,"" Vazquez said, according to NBC5.

Police said the dog was stolen around 2:20 p.m. Saturday in the 5100 block of Milam Road, near Lawson Road and Interstate 20.

Dogue de Bordeaux puppy theft Here is the video of the theft of my puppy. He is a 10 week old, red, dogue de bordeaux named ""Chipper"". This happened in Mesquite, TX. Thieves might have possible ties to Lubbock or Amarillo. $500 reward for information leading to safe return of ""Chipper"". UPDATE**** Chipper has been found and is doing wonderful, still waiting on if they have caught thieves. Posted by Ivy Bordeaux on Monday, October 8, 2018

Two men are seen in the footage pulling up to the home in a black Cadillac SUV.

They get out and walk to the fenced front yard. One appears to be talking on a cellphone while the second walks to where Chipper is standing.

The man reaches over the fence and grabs Chipper by the scruff as the puppy squeals and one of the adult dogs in the yard starts barking.

The pair then jump into the Cadillac and speed off.

Matt Ivy, a Dallas firefighter who breeds the dogs at his home, told KDFW-TV (Channel 4) that he fell in love with the breed when he was a kid.

""It's my life outside the fire department,"" he told the station, adding that he learned about the dog, also known as a Dogue de Bordeaux, in the movie Turner & Hooch. ""They told me, 'That's just a mutt, you'll never find one.' Flipped through a dog book 15 years ago and found them. Did my research and got them. Been in love with them ever since.""

Ivy said Chipper was the last of his litter and is microchipped. On his Facebook page shortly after Chipper's return, Ivy said a family from Dripping Springs had adopted the puppy Thursday.

Mesquite police did not provide detailed descriptions of the dognappers. Anyone with information about the incident is asked to call Investigator J. Halbert at 972-216-6794.

Dr. Dre shares health update after hospitalisation over suspected brain aneurysm,Dr. Dre shares health update after hospitalisation over suspected brain aneurysm: “I’m doing great”,1.0,"Dr. Dre has taken to social media to assure fans he’s “doing great”, following reports he was hospitalised and taken to an intensive care unit after a suspected brain aneurysm.

On Instagram, the hip-hop mogul thanked family, friends and fans “for their interest and well wishes”. He wrote that he was “doing great and getting excellent care from my medical team.”

“I will be out of the hospital and back home soon,” he wrote. “Shout out to all the great medical professionals at Cedars. One Love!!”

See his post below:

TMZ broke the news on Tuesday (January 5), citing “sources connected to Dre and with direct knowledge”. A crime reporter with the Los Angeles Times also reported that the 55-year-old had been hospitalised at Cedars-Sinai.

TMZ reported that Dr. Dre remained in intensive care today and was “stable and lucid”. Doctors are yet to determine the cause of the bleeding and are continuing to run tests on the rapper-cum-entrepreneur, they reported.

Dr. Dre is in the middle of divorce proceedings with Nicole Young, to whom he was married for 24 years. They are reportedly due to attend a hearing Wednesday (January 6) in Los Angeles.

Last month, it was reported that Dr. Dre’s new album was finished. The record would be Dre’s first since he released ‘Compton’ in 2015.

Detroit rapper Page Kennedy hinted that Dre’s longtime friend and collaborator, Eminem, will make an appearance on the new record. Dr. Dre is yet to confirm the album’s release date.

Fellow artists including Ice Cube, Kaytranada, DJ Paul and Ciara, among others, have since wished for Dre’s speedy recovery. Rapper LL Cool J has also tweeted that Dre is “recovering nicely”.

"School bus driver hailed as ""true hero"" after bus bursts into flames",Hero school bus driver saves 56 students before bus bursts into flames,1.0,"As soon as school bus driver Teresa Stroble heard two 9th graders yell about seeing smoke, she jumped into action.

South Carolina school bus driver Teresa Stroble is credited with saving the lives of 56 students on board after the vehicle burst into flames. WSPA

The Duncan, South Carolina, school bus driver ushered all 56 students -- from Duncan Elementary, Beech Springs Intermediate and Byrnes High School -- off her bus, and radioed the transportation office to call 911 before the vehicle burst into flames Tuesday morning.

The ""7-year veteran driver and teacher assistant for [Spartanburg School District 5] did exactly as she was trained and quickly and calmly evacuated all 56 students from the bus, and got them to a safe location,"" the school district said in an online statement several hours after the incident. ""She is a true hero!""

Firefighters arrived on the scene minutes later to contain the fire.

""She did exactly what she was trained to do,"" Superintendent Scott Turner told CBS affiliate WSPA. ""She was calm. She kept the students calm. She made sure they were safe. They were her first priority. She's our hero today.""

Stroble was able to evacuate all of the students ""in under a minute,"" he added on Twitter Tuesday afternoon. ""So grateful for her quick action.""

A local resident, who asked to remain anonymous, said he witnessed the school bus explosion and could feel the heat from the flames as he drove past the scene on West Main Street in Duncan.

""I was driving and saw a large black cloud ahead of me and as I got closer I saw the bus on fire in the car wash parking lot,"" he told CBS News. ""As I continued to drive by the heat was so intense I could feel it from inside my truck.""

The school district later notified all parents of students on the bus, reporting that there had been no injuries.

Dad hugs strangers at Pittsburgh Pride parade and brings marchers to tears,Dad gives over 700 free hugs at Pittsburgh pride parade to kids rejected by their parents,1.0,"Helping others is not something new to one Pennsylvania man, who attended and received over 700 hugs in two and a half hours from individuals at the Pittsburgh Pride parade on Saturday. Going to the parade gave Scott Dittman, who is married to a woman and has two kids, a new outlook on issues people in the LGBT community faced in their personal lives, specifically their relationships with parents.

""You go in thinking you're just going to put a smile on a few peoples faces, and you come out knowing or understanding their struggle,"" Dittman told CBS News. ""It was life-changing, it really was.""

Dittman learned about the event from a friend on Facebook, who is part of the organization Free Mom Hugs — which works with LGBT people and gives hugs at Pride events. He decided to attend the parade with his own T-shirt, which read ""Free Dad Hugs.""

""My first thought was, I'm thinking the rate of rejection from fathers is probably higher than mothers,"" Dittman told CBS News. ""I can give dad hugs.""

The tee prompted hundreds of hugs from strangers filled with deep emotions.

""She had tears welled up in her eyes and she was just staring at me,"" said Dittman. ""She just wrapped her arms around me and she didn't let go — and I wasn't going to let go.""

Since the parade, Dittman has gone viral with a Facebook post addressed to parents, which has garnered over 231,000 shares. ""Imagine that your child feels so lost from you that they sink into the arms of a complete stranger,"" wrote Dittman. ""Try to imagine how deep those cuts must be.""

Twenty-six percent of LGBT youth say their biggest problems are not feeling accepted by their family; trouble at school and bullying; and a fear to be out and open, while 22 percent of non-LGBT youth say their biggest problems are trouble with class, exams and grades, according to a survey by Human Rights Campaign.

Dittman said he received over 1,500 messages, which varied from praise to distress. He said one individual wrote him on the ""day that they saw the post was going to be their last day on earth."" Dittman said the supportive messages, words of encouragement and Dittman's post helped prevent a tragedy.

LGBT youth who come from highly rejecting families are 8.4 times as likely to have attempted suicide as LGBT peers who reported no or low levels of family rejection, according to The Trevor Project, a non-profit organization focused on suicide prevention for LGBT youth.

A church in Southern California says it raised $50,000 to wipe out more than $5 million in medical debt through the organization RIP Medical Debt.

Christian Assembly Church in Eagle Rock, California, said 5,500 households would benefit from their donation.

The church donated $50,000 to Rip Medical Debt, which helps organizations cover debt from medical providers by buying debt portfolios on a secondary market for pennies on the dollar.

""Because of the generosity of the people at Christian Assembly Church, we are able to give a Christmas gift to the people of Los Angeles, no strings attached,'' Tom Hughes, the church's co-pastor, said in a video about the gift.

Hughes said that his congregation had raised $50,000 over the course of 2019, but the members were unaware of how it would be used until now.

Hughes said that the church hopes to also work with credit agencies to repair credit scores for families who were affected by unpaid bills.

Families who are affected are expected to receive letters this week about their debt being wiped out.

Hughes said that only the billing companies will know exactly whose debt was paid off, but the each of the 28 neighborhoods where debt was paid off is home to more than 15 active church members.

Alberta woman one of first adults in Canada to be 'cured' of sickle cell anemia through stem cell transplant,Alberta woman 1st adult in Canada to be 'cured' of sickle cell anemia through stem cell transplant,1.0,"An Alberta woman is among the first adults in Canada to be cured of sickle cell anemia with the help of a sister's love — and a stem cell transplant.

Revée Agyepong, 26, of Edmonton was diagnosed with the disease as a toddler and has never known life without it.

""I remember as far back as elementary feeling sickle cell complications and not knowing what it was,"" she said.

""I thought that everyone would go out for recess and play, then come back with a terrible headache and body pain, couldn't breathe … eventually I realized it was just me.""

Sickle cell anemia is a genetic disease in which red blood cells change into a semi-circular shape and block blood vessels. Symptoms vary from patient to patient but it puts every organ in the body at risk.

Agyepong's disease manifested as chronic bone and joint pain, irregular heartbeat, kidney stones and shortness of breath.

Successfully treated in kids

Two years ago, the Alberta Children's Hospital announced it was successfully treating sickle cell disease in pediatric patients using stem cell transplants.

Agyepong said when she found out about the success of the treatment in pediatric patients, she was at a point where her health was declining and she was running out of treatment options, but doctors told her she was too old to undergo the procedure.

She was devastated.

According to Alberta Health Services, the older the patient and donor in bone marrow transplants, the greater the risk of graft versus host disease, which is a type of immune rejection that can have serious health repercussions and can even result in death.

But Stephanie Amoah, Agyepong's older sister, said she could no longer watch her sister struggle in constant pain and started to research which other centres were testing the treatment on adult patients.

""My sister has always been my protector, my guardian, she found a way,"" Agyepong said.

Sister was a 100% match

The sisters approached Agyepong's doctors and told them of the treatment going on in the east coast of the United States. Dr. Andrew Daly, who leads Alberta's bone marrow transplant program and oversaw Agyepong's stem cell transplant, said they had coincidentally been thinking about conducting adult stem cell transplants for sickle cell disease.

""My persistence, my sister's persistence, and they said my dedication to wanting a cure, was enough for them to just say, you know what, she's going to be the person, let's do this,"" Agyepong said.

Stephanie Amoah, Revée Agyepong's older sister, was a 100% donor match. She said she's happy to have been part of a process that will give her sister a new life. (Nelly Alberola/Radio-Canada)

Amoah was tested and was found to be a 100 per cent match for her sister. Daly said the odds of siblings being a perfect match is one in four.

The transplant, which took place at Calgary's Tom Baker Cancer Centre, involved Agyepong taking drugs to suppress her immune system and doing a course of low-dose radiation. Amoah underwent a process called apheresis that collected her sickle-cell-free stem cells, which were then given to Agyepong.

'Do the things she's always wanted'

""Over the past few months, what we've seen is that Revée's sister's bone marrow has taken over the production of Revée's red blood cells,"" Daly said. ""The amount of sickle cell hemoglobin in her bloodstream has decreased almost to zero.""

Today, Agyepong's blood tests don't show any signs of the disease, which makes her essentially cured. Amoah said the change she sees in her sister is amazing.

""It's phenomenal. I'm just so happy to have been part of a process that will give her a new life, a new hope and be able to do the things she's always wanted to do,"" Amoah said.

Agyepong said she is still recovering from the transplant but when she is one year out, she plans to dedicate her time to advocating for the disease, and just live her life like a normal person.

""I want to travel somewhere exotic and somewhere warm and feel dehydration like anyone else would, because I couldn't with sickle cell, I would be dehydrated and end up in the hospital,"" she said.

""It sounds so insignificant but it's really exciting just to be able to be more spontaneous.""",http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-sickle-cell-stem-cell-transplant-adult-cure-1.4603731
Dad who lunged at Larry Nassar donating GoFundMe earnings to help sexual abuse survivors,Dad who lunged at Larry Nassar donating GoFundMe earnings to help sexual abuse survivors,1.0,"The man who attempted to attack former Michigan State University doctor Larry Nassar during his Eaton County sentencing hearing will be donating earnings from a fundraising account in his name to charity.

Randy Margraves, the father of three victims of Nassar and a member of IBEW 665, lunged at his daughters' former doctor last week after hearing victim impact statements from his daughters in court. He was detained and later released without charges, but a GoFundMe online fundraiser was started in his name.

That fundraiser earned $31,311 before the account was closed, according to a joint statement from Margraves and IBEW 665. Many of the donations came from IBEW members throughout the country.

""While Randy deeply appreciates the outpouring of support, he says it is not needed for him,"" the statement read. ""This situation has demonstrated the strength of the bond among our union brothers and sisters...we're glad to see the money going to organizations that help survivors of abuse.""

Donors can choose to get a refund before March 9, or leave the donation to be given to local charities such as Small Talk, RAVE, and the Firecracker Foundation that help sexual abuse survivors.

""At the time of the incident, I didn't know that the great brotherhood had done this, and I was overcome with gratitude when I found out,"" Margraves said in the statement. ""I appreciate everyone stepping up to support me, but help is not needed for me.""

During Nassar's sentencing hearing last Friday, Margraves was there to to support his two of his daughters, Lauren and Madison, as they gave statements in person in the courtroom Friday.

All three of Randall Margraves' daughters had been sexually abused by Nassar, a prominent sports physician now facing a lifetime in prison for inappropriately touching hundreds of women and girls. All three gave statements in either his Eaton or Ingham county sentencing hearings.

But he didn't know the full extent of what his children were going to say, and after seeing Nassar's reaction, he asked to say a few words.

He called Nassar a son of a bitch, and Judge Janice Cunningham asked him not to swear.

Margraves asked the court to have five minutes alone in a locked room with Nassar, and audience members in the courtroom laughed awkwardly when Cunningham told him she couldn't do that. Then he asked for a minute, and she told him she couldn't let him do that, either.

Without warning, Margraves rushed towards Nassar. Nassar ducked as one of his defense attorneys jumped in front of his client. Margraves was quickly detained, and courtroom proceedings stopped momentarily. He was later released without charges.

Margraves' action sent shockwaves through the courtroom and the country as those who witnessed what happened got a raw glimpse into the devastating pain Nassar's actions had caused the victims and their families.

It sparked the creation of a GoFundMe account in his name, which spread rapidly throughout the day and earned more than $30,000.

He apologized profusely for his actions, noting at a press conference later that day that he was embarrassed.

""I want to make it real clear that I am no hero. My daughters are the heroes and all the victims and the survivors of this terrible atrocity,"" Margraves said on Friday night.",http://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2018/02/dad_who_lunged_at_nassar_donat.html
"Active agent in magic mushrooms could treat addiction, depression and anxiety","Active agent in magic mushrooms could treat addiction, depression and anxiety - 60 Minutes",1.0,"The thought of dying was killing Kerry Pappas. Then the cancer patient took a trip on psilocybin – the active agent in ""magic mushrooms."" Ever since, she says she is perfectly comfortable with her life.



Pappas is one of dozens of cancer patients whose painful anxiety over their illness was commuted to more peaceful acceptance after participating in a study that involved intensive therapy and being given a drug that was once a symbol of the 60's counterculture. She and others, who say the psychedelic experience helped them overcome other problems like depression and addiction, talk to Anderson Cooper for a report on the study of psychedelics inside some of the country's foremost medical research centers. The story will be broadcast on ""60 Minutes,"" Sunday, October 13, at 7:30 p.m. ET and 7 p.m. PT on CBS.



Pappas was being treated for lung cancer when she was given the psilocybin. This is what she tells Cooper she saw. ""An ancient, prehistoric, barren land… there's these men with pickaxes, just slamming on the rocks,"" she recalls. ""I was being shown the truth of reality. Life is meaningless. We have no purpose."" And then it hit her she says, ""I look and I'm still like a witness with the eyes, a beautiful, shimmering bright jewel and then it was sound… booming, booming, booming. Right here right now. Yes, you are alive. Right here. Right now. Because that's all you have."" She tells Cooper: ""That is my mantra to this day.""



Cooper speaks with participants and scientists who conduct clinical trials. Roland Griffiths, of Johns Hopkins University, is a pioneer in psychedelic research, which was studied extensively until former President Nixon signed the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. Thirty years later, Griffiths received FDA approval for to study psilocybin. The results amazed him. ""The red light started flashing. It's unprecedented – the capacity of the human organism to change. It just was astounding.""



The experiences of the study participants on psychedelics, even under the highly controlled conditions used, are often harrowing but still worth it in the end. Researchers screen out people with psychotic disorders or with close relatives who have schizophrenia or Bipolar Disorder. So far, none of the participants reports any serious adverse outcomes.



Griffiths said he is optimistic about the potential therapeutic value of the drugs but acknowledges they can be harmful under different circumstances. ""Let's be really clear on that… We're very aware of the risks and would not recommend people simply go out and do this.""",https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/psilocybin-active-agent-in-magic-mushrooms-could-treat-addiction-depression-and-anxiety-60-minutes-2019-10-10/

His mom had invited 30 children to her son's fourth birthday party and not one of them showed up at the Chuck E. Cheese parlor in New Jersey, where she had reserved space for the celebration.

""He was looking at the door. You saw the disappointment on his face,"" Angel Kazanis told InsideEdition.com.

The employees felt heartsick as well.

""I immediately ran to the kitchen and was so upset,"" said worker Taylor Inzinna. The mother ""was handling it so much better than I was. ... She held it together and never let Evan know for a second she was upset, which I think was super awesome.""

But Inzinna wanted to somehow salvage Evan's huge disappointment.

She posted on Facebook her desire to give the child a party with presents. Her colleagues, family members and friends responded, and ""within three to four days, I had about 13 gifts,"" she said.

Inzinna contacted Kazanis and said the store wanted to do something for Evan to make him feel special. Could they come back in? She didn't say a word about the gifts.

So mother and son returned.

""The day he came back in, seeing the smile on his face was everything I wanted,"" Inzinna said. ""I had one goal that day and my goal was to make sure that he left happy. And he left going, 'Oh my God, Mom, this is the best day ever.'''

Evan's mother was again overcome when she saw how delighted her son was when presented with an avalanche of wrapped gifts.

""I was shocked. I had to keep myself from crying. I didn't want him to see how this affected me,"" Kazanis said. ""They made him feel a million dollars, like he was the most important kid in the whole world.

""He is not going to forget it. He remembers everyone and everything.""

Skateboarders who stopped sex assault among Calgarians honoured for bravery at Chief's Awards Gala,"Four skateboarders will receive special recognition after they stepped in when a man was sexually assaulting a drunk woman, scared him off, chased him down, and held him until police arrested him (x-post from r/skateboarding)",1.0,"Four skateboarders received special recognition after they stepped in when a man was sexually assaulting a teenage girl, scared him off, chased him down, and held him until police arrested him.

The young men — and 25 other Calgarians — received an award from Chief Const. Roger Chaffin in recognition for their exceptional bravery at the Chief's Awards Gala Thursday night.

The four friends were in an underground parkade at Chinook Mall when they saw a well-dressed man carrying what appeared to be a seriously drunk and distraught young woman.

""She was screaming and yelling. She just wanted to be out of there. She was all scuffed up and dirty,"" said Carsyn Wright, one of the longboarders.

'We needed to be there for her,' says skateboarder Carsyn Wright CBC News Calgary 0:22 Carsyn Wright and three of his friends stopped a sexual assault and won special recognition for their service. 0:22

They stopped the man and began questioning him to determine whether or not the young woman was safe.

The man answered the group's questions, saying he was trying to phone the girl's father for a ride home.

The group, believing him, let him go and watched the pair enter a nearby stairwell.

""You don't want to really think of the worst in somebody like that. You don't want that situation to be real, so you just brush it off and hope for the best,"" Wright said.

Stopping the assault

The four friends rode off with the intention of returning to check on the girl a few minutes later.

When they returned, they saw the man sexually assaulting the young woman.

""He had her in a stairwell, bent over, and just, it was disgusting,"" Wright said.

Arnaud Nimenya said his initial reaction was one of shock. ""You walk in, and you see something like that, and you freeze. You don't know what to do.""

When they realized what was happening, they immediately moved to stop the attack.

""He was trying to walk out and walk away from us,"" said Nimenya. ""He pushed me aggressively out of the way, kinda like just gives me the smile, like, 'I can do this. You can't do anything about it.'""

Chasing the attacker

Instead of letting him get away, three of the skateboarders chased him down, while one remained behind to stay with the victim.

Following the foot chase, there was a physical confrontation in which the man picked up a longboard and began to attack his three pursuers.

Police arrived moments later, arrested the man and charged him with sexual assault.

Later, when police tried to contact the four friends to recognize them for their bravery and service, Nimenya said he was caught off guard.

""We always thought we were going to be in trouble, because we fought with him. When they called us, we didn't wanna answer.""

Noticing that something was very wrong, he ran over to the car, peered inside and realized the driver needed help.

He smashed the window open with a rock to get the driver out, and then provided CPR and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

EMS staff said the driver of that car had suffered a massive heart attack and would have died, if not for Eddy.

Candice Payne: Viral deed of housing homeless at hotel ‘was a no-brainer’,"Candice Payne, the 34-year-old Chicago realtor who rented hotel rooms for dozens of the city's homeless during the recent polar vortex, said she found her calling through the experience.",1.0,"So just who is Candice Payne, the Chicagoan who rented hotel rooms for the homeless during the recent polar vortex?

After her selfless deed went viral, it drew an onslaught of volunteers locally and donations nationally, leading to last week’s appearance on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show.”

There, she got a $50,000 gift from Walmart, which she turned around and donated to her nonprofit, Action For A Cause Now.

A humble and successful 34-year-old businesswoman, Payne’s life has been forever changed by what began as worry for those outside during a spell predicted to bring the most frigid Chicago temperatures seen in decades.

“Those five days gave me a new purpose,” she said in a recent chat.

“For five days, my life, my heart, was there with the homeless. For them to share their stories with me, to listen to them, cry with them, understand there are so many different reasons for why they’re where they’re at. I realized that was just a temporary fix.”

Payne started Action For A Cause Now two years ago but hadn’t decided what to do with it. Now, she’s decided to focus on helping the homeless. She started a Gofundme page that has brought in about $25,000. Besides building multi-unit housing for the homeless,it also will join a trend by creating night shelters for the homeless out of shipping containers.

“I didn’t do this for any reason other than to help, but I’m glad it’s raised awareness and gives me a platform to help the homeless on a larger scale,” she said.

Chicagoans cocooned during the vortex that brought temperatures under 20 degrees below zero on Jan. 30-31. Then word spread of the efforts of a good Samaritan to shelter the homeless at the Amber Inn on the South Side, the only hotel that would take them.

Payne initially was leery of the spotlight. But when folks started speculating it was some wealthy or famous benefactor renting hotel rooms and driving all over town picking up homeless, she felt it important to let people know it was a regular person, or as she says, “a working black woman.”

“It was going to be way too cold that Wednesday, so I told my employees not to come in to work. I’d planned to stay in bed, watching TV and on my laptop. Then I started thinking, ‘Man, what about the people who don’t have anywhere to go tomorrow night?

“I instantly said, ‘I’m going to put 20 hotel rooms on my American Express card,'” Payne recounts.

Her efforts, applauded by the likes of Hillary Clinton, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Common, potentially saved lives, as experts say such cold spells are most lethal for the homeless — time spent in subzero temperatures can cause death in under 24 hours.

Payne ultimately got 122 homeless people off the street, personally paying for 30 rooms, and raising more than $23,000 through social media pleas. It all covered 72 hotel rooms for five nights. Volunteers and donors joined her to provide meals and toiletries.

“For me, it was a no-brainer,” she said of the feat that triggered requests for TV appearances not only from Ellen DeGeneres, but “Steve Harvey” and “Good Morning America.”

“I chose Ellen over the others, because I love Ellen,” Payne said.

Payne lives in Hazel Crest, but grew up in Auburn Gresham, the youngest of four children and only daughter of her father, a South Side hairstylist, and her late mother, who died in 2013.

A graduate of Chicago Public Schools’ Lindblom Math & Science Academy, she obtained her associate’s degree in business from City Colleges of Chicago, and bought her first building at age 20. It was a bad investment. At 23, she had to file for bankruptcy.

Payne then enrolled in real estate school, got her license and repaired her credit. In 2011, she bought another building and quit her Comcast job of eight years to focus on real estate.

“I’ve always had a serial entrepreneur spirit. During those eight years, I’d started all different types of businesses,” she said. “It wasn’t until I met the legendary Jacob da Builder, who inspired me to do fix and flips, that I found what works for me.”

Her success at rehabbing homes last year won her the Cook County Land Bank Authority’s Project of the Year Award.After working a few years with other firms, she opened her own brokerage in 2016, 5th Group Realty in the South Loop. In December, she opened a second business, Body Werks Spa in Bronzeville.

Payne has a significant other, and considers her three multi-colored Pomeranians — Fendi, Rolex and Coco-Chanel — her children.

She knows about adversity. That significant other was once homeless. Her late mother struggled with addiction. And Payne became caregiver for her younger brother, now 19, after her mom’s death. But she also knows blessings.

“If you’ve never done anything for anyone else, especially someone in need, you’ll never feel the fulfillment I felt last week. But I definitely didn’t think it would go this far,” she said.

“Watching it go viral, I’m thinking, ‘What’s the big deal? Just for helping someone?’ It could have been an ugly situation out there, that cold was so brutal. I had to talk to God a few times, and as I headed home that last day, I knew what I had to do next.”",https://chicago.suntimes.com/2019/2/10/18413042/candice-payne-viral-deed-of-housing-homeless-at-hotel-was-a-no-brainer
The price of solar electricity has dropped 89% in 10 years,The price of solar electricity has dropped 89% in 10 years,1.0,"advertisement advertisement

To curb our climate crisis, we need to end our dependence on fossil fuels and power the world with renewables. That may have seemed far-fetched a decade ago given the cost of installing wind and solar at the time, but the price of renewables has been falling fast. In 10 years, the price of solar electricity dropped 89%, and the price of onshore wind dropped 70%.

Clean energy has already passed its economic tipping point. A 2019 report from the nonprofit Rocky Mountain Institute found that it was cheaper to build and use a combination of renewables like wind and solar than to build new natural gas plants. A 2020 report from Carbon Tracker found that in every single one of the world’s energy markets, it’s cheaper to invest in renewables than in coal. And now, graphs recently published on Our World in Data, an online science publication, in partnership with Oxford University, starkly visualize that decline. Comparing the price of electricity from new power plants in 2009 and 2019, one graph shows how the price of solar photovoltaic power (from solar panels) plummets from $359 per megawatt hour to $40, the cheapest of any of the power options on the chart and an 89% decrease. If housing prices declined at that same rate, Our World in Data researcher Max Roser writes, a home that cost $3,590 to rent in 2009 would cost just $400 in 2019. Over the same time period, the price of coal barely budged, from $111 per megawatt hour in 2009 to $109 in 2019. In 2009, building a new solar farm was 223% more expensive than building a new coal plant. Now, it’s flipped: Electricity from a new coal plant is 177% more expensive than electricity from new solar panels. What caused the switch? Huge leaps in technological advancement. “To understand why solar power got so cheap we have to understand why solar technology got cheap,” Roser writes.

The first instances of solar tech weren’t affordable at all. In 1965, the first price point for usable solar tech Roser found in his research, 1 watt cost $1,865 (in 2019 prices). Though homeowners weren’t shelling out that much for power from solar panels then, the technology did end up being used for satellites. And like with other technologies, the more something is produced, the cheaper and easier it becomes to produce. It’s thanks to that initial demand in the high-tech sector of satellites, Roser writes, that we learned cheaper ways to produce solar modules. From 1976 to 2019, the cost of a photovoltaic module—a solar panel—dropped from $106 per watt to $0.38 per watt. “Once solar hit scale, it started having its own supply chain . . . and the module itself got a lot cheaper,” says David Feldman, a senior financial analyst at the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory. And with that scale there was more research and development. “The technology itself continued to improve in terms of efficiency, reliability, longevity, so there are all these other things in additional to scaling up.” This “learning by doing” helped lower the cost of installation and building for solar systems too. With expanded capacity, the price of solar electricity, not just solar tech, also drops. Another Our World in Data graph shows how as we build more solar farms and renewable capacity goes up, the price of that renewable energy goes down. In 2010, with fewer than 50,000 megawatts of solar installed, a megawatt hour of solar electricity cost $378. In 2019, with more than 500,000 megawatts installed, that price drops to $68.

"Bill protecting sharks, all rays moves forward",Bill protecting sharks and all rays moves forward,1.0,"KAILUA-KONA — Protection for all sharks and rays within state waters has moved another step closer to reality.

Senate Bill 2079 cleared the state House Committee on Ocean, Marine Resources and Hawaiian Affairs with amendments on March 13 after securing a 5-0 vote. Rep. Richard Creagan, D-South Kona, portions of North Kona and Ka’u, was among the representatives voting in favor of the bill; two representatives were excused from the vote.

ADVERTISING

The proposal seeks to protect all sharks and rays within state waters for ecological purposes, and their value to Native Hawaiian cultural practices and the ocean recreation industry. The committee on March 13 added an exception for sharks taken outside of state marine waters and possessed on a vessel in state marine waters pursuant to a federally managed fishery for the purpose of landing the catch in the state.

In its current form, the bill would establish fines for “knowingly capture, take, possess, abuse, or entangle any shark, whether alive or dead, or kill any shark, within state marine waters.” It would also expand similar protections afforded to manta rays in 2009 to include all rays — or hihimanu.

Violating the law would be a misdemeanor offense with fines ranging from $500 to $10,000 and an administrative fine up to $10,000 per specimen.

Exceptions are listed for research and educational purposes, as well as traditional and customary rights protected by the Hawaii Constitution.

Senate Bill 2079 passed its third reading in the state Senate and was sent to the House earlier this month. The full House passed on it first reading March 8 and referred it for hearings before two committees.

To remain alive, the measure needs to pass a second reading by the House and secure a hearing before the Committee on Judiciary.",http://www.westhawaiitoday.com/2018/03/20/hawaii-news/bill-protecting-sharks-all-rays-moves-forward/
"Man throws away winning $100,000 lottery ticket, realizes mistake just in time","Man throws away winning $100,000 lottery ticket, realizes mistake just in time",1.0,"“I checked the results for the day before,” the man told the lottery.

A South Carolina man is counting his lucky stars after almost making a very expensive mistake when he threw away his winning $100,000 lottery ticket before realizing he had actually won.

The incident happened when the unnamed man purchased a Palmetto Cash 5 ticket from a BP gas station in Newberry, South Carolina, and, when checking the numbers of the lottery results, saw that he had lost and threw his ticket in the trash.

The only problem is that he had actually won $100,000.

“I checked the results for the day before,” the man told the South Carolina Education Lottery according to a statement.

His Palmetto Cash 5 ticket had actually matched all five numbers drawn on Friday, Jan. 24 and he only realized it when he was sipping his coffee and happened to look over the results again when he realized the horrific mistake.

“I couldn’t believe it,” he said to the South Carolina Education Lottery.

He managed to retrieve the ticket and turn it in to collect his winnings.

The winner said that he now plans to give the money to charity and set up a college fund for his grandchildren.

The BP gas station that sold the ticket received a commission of $1,000 for selling the winning ticket.

The odds of winning $100,000 playing Palmetto Cash 5 are 1 in 501,942, which, according to the Independent, is slightly more likely than you winning a gold medal in the Olympics or being crushed to death by a meteor.

In fact, you are actually an estimated 50 times more likely to win an Oscar, statistically, than you are hitting the $100,000 jackpot.",https://abcnews.go.com/US/man-throws-winning-100000-lottery-ticket-realizes-mistake/story?id=68903747

Corruption in medicine and the constant fear of being fleeced by doctors and hospitals makes one doubt the profession. With several cases of medical malpractice and fraud doing the rounds, it's easy to lose faith in doctors. But here is one woman who, even at the age of 91, is living up to the Hippocratic oath.

Dr Bhakti Yadav holds the proud distinction of being the first MBBS-degree holder in the city of Indore. And since 1948, one year after India gained independence, Dr Yadav has been treating patients for free.

A gynaecologist, Dr Bhakti Yadav has delivered thousands of babies and never charged a fee. She has formed a reputation of being a caring doctor who doesn't let her patients feel ignored. Even though her age has affected her work since she can't see too many patients now, many women across Madhya Pradesh and from Uttar Pradesh consult her. And she doesn't dismiss them. Even if she can't examine a patient herself, her medical advice is valued.

So the next time you dismiss someone as useless based on their age, think again. You may be sitting across someone as strong as Dr Bhakti Yadav.

Carter, the nation's 39th president and oldest-living former president in U.S. history at 96 years old, lives a fairly normal — and frugal — life, The Washington Post reported in 2018. In fact, Carter still lives in the ranch house he built himself in 1961. The home, in rural Plains, Georgia (about a 2½-hour drive south of Atlanta) is a two-bedroom ranch assessed at just $167,000, which is ""less than the value of the armored Secret Service vehicles parked outside,"" the Post reports. It's also less than the median home price in Georgia, which is $213,026, according to real estate site Zillow.

In addition to his affordable home, Carter's frugal tendencies include spending weekends dining with neighbors on paper plates with bargain-brand wine, the Post says. In addition, it says he and wife Rosalynn make their own yogurt. Carter has also been known to buy his clothes at his local Dollar General store, according to a 2011 Rolling Stone story (he showed up for the store's opening in Plains in 2004), and he often flies commercial.

In recent years, Carter has made much of his income from writing books, the Post repored; he has published at least 33, including a children's book and reflections on his presidency. (Thriftbooks.com lists 46 books.) Carter also receives a $210,700 annual pension, as do all former presidents, plus the federal government gives all ex-presidents an allowance for things like travel and office space. In 2017, Carter got more than $230,000 in such allowances, according to the National Taxpayers Union Foundation, a conservative advocacy group.

HOUSTON -- Texans defensive end J.J. Watt will pay for the funerals of those killed in the shooting at Santa Fe High School, the team confirmed.

Ten people were killed Friday morning and 10 more were wounded when a 17-year-old carrying a shotgun and revolver opened fire at the high school about 30 miles from downtown Houston.

According to Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez, nine of those killed were students. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott called the shooting ""one of the most heinous attacks that we've ever seen in the history of Texas schools.""

According to police officials, the 17-year-old is in custody and has been charged with capital murder, and a second person has been detained.

Shortly after the shooting, Watt tweeted:

New Zealand company offers employees $10 a day to cycle to work,New Zealand company offers employees $10 a day to cycle to work: Christchurch advertising firm says workers could feel energised by the exercise – and the money.,1.0,"A Christchurch company is offering hard cash to employees who bike to work everyday in a bid to energise staff and move the city away from a reliance on cars.

Employees who cycle to and from work will receive $5 a day and if they keep it up for more than half a year that amount will double to $10 a day, paid out as a bonus at the end of year.

“For a while I had been thinking it would be great to incentivise cycling in some way. I’m a really keen cyclist [and] cash is clearly the most obvious incentive,” Tim Chesney from advertising agency Make Collective told Stuff.

“My gut instinct is that it could be something really good for the workplace. I know for myself I show up feeling a lot more energised, my blood is already flowing.”

Chesney said some employees were initially reluctant because the office had no shower facilities, but the offer of potentially hundreds of extra dollars a year was too good to refuse and five of his six employees had joined the scheme.

“The extra money is coming straight out of the businesses profits, but I really believe there will be numerous tangible benefits as a result of people cycling to and from work.”

Developer Elliot Gilmore told Stuff that recovering from his ride to work was “the hardest part”, but the pay-off for his health was better than a gym membership.

“It’s been great so far, I mean, I get to ride through Hagley Park and see people feeding the ducks, reading books and stuff, which is quite different to just waiting for the lights to change while driving.”

According to the council, Christchurch has more cyclists than any other New Zealand city, with 13 major cycle routes running through the wreckage and reconstruction of the city centre.

Associate transport minister Julie Anne Genter said investment in cycleways were a key feature of the ongoing rebuild, with the urban cycleways programme costingNZ$150m.

“Safe cycleways are a key part of making Christchurch a healthy, happy and vibrant city full of people, rather than traffic,” said Genter.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/07/new-zealand-cycle-cash-10-a-day-employees-work-company
"2,000-year-old redwoods survive wildfire at California's oldest state park","2,000-year-old redwoods survive wildfire at California park",1.0,"BOULDER CREEK, Calif. — When a massive wildfire swept through California’s oldest state park last week it was feared many trees in a grove of old-growth redwoods, some of them 2,000 years old and among the tallest living things on Earth, may finally have succumbed.

But an Associated Press reporter and photographer hiked the renowned Redwood Trail at Big Basin Redwoods State Park on Monday and confirmed most of the ancient redwoods had withstood the blaze. Among the survivors is one dubbed Mother of the Forest.

“That is such good news, I can’t tell you how much that gives me peace of mind,” said Laura McLendon, conservation director for the Sempervirens Fund, an environmental group dedicated to the protection of redwoods and their habitats.

Redwood forests are meant to burn, she said, so reports earlier this week that the state park was “gone” were misleading.

The historic park headquarters is gone, as are many small buildings and campground infrastructure that went up in flames as fire swept through the park about 45 miles south of San Francisco.

“But the forest is not gone,” McLendon said. “It will regrow. Every old growth redwood I’ve ever seen, in Big Basin and other parks, has fire scars on them. They’ve been through multiple fires, possibly worse than this.”

When forest fires, windstorms and lightning hit redwood trees, those that don’t topple can resprout. Mother of the Forest, for example, used to be 329 feet tall, the tallest tree in the park. After the top broke off in a storm, a new trunk sprouted where the old growth had been.

Trees that fall feed the forest floor and become nurse trees from which new redwoods grow. Forest critters, from banana slugs to insects, thrive under logs.

On Monday, Steller’s jays searched for insects around the park’s partially burned outdoor amphitheater and woodpeckers could be heard hammering on trees. Occasionally a thundering crash echoed through the valley as large branches or burning trees fell.

When Big Basin opened in 1902 it marked the genesis of redwood conservation. The park now receives about 250,000 visitors a year from around the world, and millions have walked the Redwood Trail.

The park only recently reopened after COVID-19-related closures and now is closed because of the fire. The road in is blocked by several large trees that fell across it, some waist-high, some still on fire.

While there is a great deal of work to be done rebuilding campgrounds, clearing trails and managing damaged madrones, oaks and firs, Big Basin will recover, McLendon said.

“The forest, in some ways, is resetting,” she said.

State Parks District Superintendent Chris Spohrer said he was pleased to know the redwoods had survived. He said an assessment team had only been able to check buildings so far, and that he hopes they can inspect the trees in the coming days.

“The reason those trees are so old is because they are really resilient,” he said.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/2-000-year-old-redwoods-survive-wildfire-california-s-oldest-n1237949
Conversion therapy: What you need to know,Canada is considering a change to the Criminal Code to ban the practice of conversion therapy across the country.,1.0,"In an about-face, the federal government is considering a change to the Criminal Code to ban the practice of conversion therapy across the country.

In March this year, the Liberal government rejected a petition with more than 18,000 signatures calling for a national ban. It said that, ""conversion therapies are immoral, painful, and do not reflect the values of our government or those of Canadians,"" but added that it felt conversion therapy was largely a provincial and territorial issue.

However, according to a letter signed by two Liberal cabinet ministers and an Alberta MP, and sent to the provinces in June , the federal government is now looking at ways to reform the Criminal Code in order to ""combat conversion therapy.""

News of the possible national ban comes as St. Albert, Alta., has become the second Canadian city after Vancouver to make it illegal for businesses to offer conversion therapy.

Other regions are also considering whether to follow suit.

WATCH: The National's story about St. Albert's conversion therapy ban

Alberta city moves to ban anti-gay conversion therapy The National 2:10 Alberta's United Conservative government says it does not condone conversion therapy. In fact, only a handful of provinces have banned it outright. But the frustration that Alberta hasn't done so has prompted one Alberta city to take its own stand. 2:10

What is it?

Conversion therapy is a practice that aims to change an individual's sexual orientation to heterosexual or gender identity to cisgender, which means identifying with the sex assigned to them at birth.

It employs various approaches, from talk therapy and medication, to aversion therapy that attempts to condition a person's behaviour by causing them discomfort through things like electric shocks when they're exposed to specific stimuli.

It is believed conversion therapy has existed for more than a century, with German psychiatrist Albert von Schrenck-Notzing being one of the first to use the practice on patients.

Peter Gajdics, author of the book The Inheritance of Shame, spent six years in conversion therapy with a licensed psychiatrist in Victoria, B.C. At first, he says the psychiatrist prescribed several antidepressants and a sedative so that Gajdics' ""innate heterosexuality would resurface.""

When that didn't happen, Gajdics says his psychiatrist began using aversion therapy.

""It's not so much that I wanted to kill myself as I thought I was already dead,"" says Gajdics, describing how he felt after he stopped seeing his psychiatrist.

What is conversion therapy? An expert explains The National 1:36 Dr. Kristopher Wells is one of the driving forces behind the campaign to ban conversion therapy in Canada. He is the Canada Research Chair for the Public Understanding of Sexual & Gender Minority Youth and describes the dangers of the controversial therapy. 1:36

Where is conversion therapy offered in Canada?

These days, it's uncommon to find medical professionals offering conversion therapy to patients.

""You won't be able to walk into a licensed counsellor's office and ask them to engage in this practice, because it would be deemed to be unethical and unprofessional,"" says Dr. Kristopher Wells, Canada Research Chair for the Public Understanding of Sexual And Gender Minority Youth.

As a result, Wells warns, the practice has gone underground in faith-based communities, ""which makes it harder to detect, but also more dangerous.""

The painful toll of going through conversion therapy The National 3:44 Those who've experienced conversion therapy often describe it as difficult and painful. The National reached out to two Canadians who have gone through it and they agreed to share their stories. 3:44

Does conversion therapy work?

The science says no.

Researchers at Cornell University looked at 47 peer-reviewed studies from 1992 through 2015 about the effects of conversion therapy. They found only 13 studies made an empirical determination about whether conversion therapy works.

Of the 13 studies, 12 concluded conversion therapy is ineffective and/or harmful.

The lone study that suggested conversion therapy could be successful had notable limitations, as it was entirely based on self-reporting, according to researchers.

""[Conversion therapy] can lead to depression, self-loathing … self-harming behaviours such as cutting or drug and alcohol abuse … all the way up to people taking their own lives,"" Wells says.

The World Health Organization issued a statement in 2012 saying this type of therapy poses a ""severe threat to the health and human rights of the affected persons.""

The Canadian Psychological Association, which represents psychologists, warned in a 2015 statement that, ""Conversion or reparative therapy can result in negative outcomes, such as distress, anxiety, depression, negative self-image, a feeling of personal failure, difficulty sustaining relationships, and sexual dysfunction.""

The CPA added that it "" opposes any therapy with the goal of repairing or converting an individual's sexual orientation , regardless of age,"" including conversion therapy.

What are governments doing about it?

""The provincial, territorial, municipal and federal governments all have roles to play to protect Canadians from the harms associated with the practice,"" reads a letter sent by the federal government to the provinces last month.

The Liberal government says it plans to examine the issue with an eye to a Criminal Code ban.

Several provinces have already enacted laws to restrict conversion therapy:

Ontario has made the practice illegal for minors by initiating an outright ban.

has made the practice illegal for minors by initiating an outright ban. Manitoba has outlawed health professionals from offering conversion therapy.

has outlawed health professionals from offering conversion therapy. Nova Scotia has made it illegal for health professionals to provide conversion therapy for minors.

However, the only two jurisdictions with a complete ban on conversion therapy are Vancouver and St. Albert, Alta .

""We need to keep making sure that we're making youth safe,"" says St. Albert City Councillor Natalie Joly, who brought forth the motion to ban conversion therapy to council in May.

Michael Jordan donates $2 million from hit documentary to feed America's hungry,Michael Jordan donates $2 million from hit documentary to feed America's hungry,1.0,"(CNN) ""The Last Dance"" was filled with hot dishes about Michael Jordan's time with the six-time champion Chicago Bulls. Now, some proceeds from the Emmy-winning documentary will go toward hot dishes for the nation's hungry.

Feeding America, the nation's largest hunger-relief outfit, on Wednesday thanked His Airness for a $2 million gift to the organization, which comes as the pandemic is pushing an inordinate number of Americans into food security.

""In these challenging times and in a year of unimaginable difficulty due to Covid-19, it's more important than ever to pause and give thanks,"" the 14-time NBA All-Star said in a tweet sent by the organization

""I am proud to be donating additional proceeds from 'The Last Dance' to Feeding America and its member food banks in the Carolinas and Chicago,"" Jordan said.

Hit doc does more than entertain

ESPN's 10-part documentary on one of the greatest basketball players in history (and, yes, many hoops heads would argue the greatest) came as a welcome distraction in April , near the beginning of the pandemic.

""The Last Dance"" was cobbled together from hundreds of hours of footage documenting the Bulls' rise to total dominance in the 1990s, with a special focus on the 1997-1998 season, when Jordan & Co. won their last of six titles.

The documentary series was set for a June debut, but after Covid-19 forced a hiatus to the NBA season and other sports offerings, ESPN moved up its release to fill the programming void.

The timing of MJ's donation is excellent, as Feeding America warned earlier this month that more than 54 million Americans could soon be facing food insecurity -- a number that rivals recession statistics.

That's roughly 16% of the population, more than 1 in 6 Americans. The sum represents roughly 17 million more people than were going hungry before the coronavirus outbreak, Feeding America estimates.

""What we've seen has been, unfortunately, a steady level of greatly, significantly increased need since the pandemic started,"" said Katie Fitzgerald, the nonprofit's chief operating officer. ""About 40 percent of the people who are showing up for food distributions have never before had to rely on charitable food assistance.""

In April, the US Department of Agriculture said it had set aside more than $1.7 billion to assist food banks in the then-looming crisis.

'It's a relief'

This week, Regina Status accepted a food basket , replete with turkey and other Thanksgiving mainstays, from Agatha House Foundation, a local food pantry, at her Bronx, New York, apartment.

She wasn't eligible for unemployment and was relying on money she has set aside for her daughters' college fund to survive, she told CNN.

Totaling her car several weeks ago made her life only more arduous. She's grateful for the weekly deliveries from Agatha House, she said.

Regina Status, right, and her daughter, 13, give food to their neighbor, Mammie Vinning, in the Bronx.

""I didn't even know where that was going to come from,"" she said. ""It's a relief that somebody is actually thinking about me.""

Agatha House is seeing many new faces, with 100% increase in demand since the pandemic began, founder Jeanette Joseph-Greenaway said.

The Bronx, New York's poorest borough, serves as a microcosm of the national crisis: It has the highest number of Covd-19 cases and the highest unemployment rate in the five boroughs, demonstrating how the pandemic and its severe side effects threaten to compound already glaring health disparities among low-incomes families.

Hunger, health issues hit minorities hardest

The congressional district that includes the Bronx, which is composed mostly of Black and Latino households, is the nation's second worst when it comes to food insecurity among children -- a condition that's only exacerbated by school closings.

""There are 22 million children who even before this pandemic relied upon free and reduced lunch,"" Feeding America CEO Claire Babineaux-Fontenot said. ""When you hear that schools are closed, not only does that mean that there are challenges for children with an education, but it also means lost meals.""

Status knows this all too well.

Before the pandemic, Black Americans were nearly two-and-a-half times as likely to live in food-insecure households as White Americans, while Latinos were twice as likely, according to Feeding America, whose projections for 2020 indicate 18 of the 25 counties that will be hit the hardest are majority African American.",https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/26/us/michael-jordan-feeding-america-donation-last-dance/index.html

Lottery officials say she chose to take a lump sum payment of $480 million, or $336 million after taxes.

It's the largest grand prize won by a single lottery ticket in U.S. history.

Noon

The head of the Massachusetts lottery says the winner of the $758.7 million Powerball jackpot has come forward to claim the prize.

Michael Sweeney, the lottery's executive director, says the winner will be introduced at 1 p.m. at lottery headquarters. All he would say about the winner is that it is an individual woman.

A store in Chicopee, Massachusetts, sold the only ticket that won the jackpot. It's the largest grand prize won by a single lottery ticket in U.S. history.

Sweeney also apologized for the lottery's erroneous announcement early Thursday that the winning ticket had been sold at a store in Watertown. He blamed it on human error.

___

10:30 a.m.

The owner of the store that sold the lone winning Powerball ticket says he's donating the store's $50,000 prize to several local charities.

Bob Bolduc owns the Pride store chain. One of its stores, in Chicopee, Massachusetts, sold the only ticket that won the $758.7 million jackpot. It's the largest grand prize won by a single lottery ticket in U.S. history.

He says once they heard that the winning ticket was sold Wednesday afternoon, store workers looked it up on the surveillance video and believe the winner was a middle-aged woman.

Bolduc says they're happy for the customer, and happy for the charities.

The lottery says the winner still had not come forward as of midmorning Thursday.

___

10 a.m.

The head of the Massachusetts State Lottery says a transcription error led the organization to wrongly identify the store that sold the lone winning Powerball ticket.

In a statement issued Thursday morning, lottery Executive Director Michael Sweeney says officials were manually recording the names of the retailers that sold the winning ticket for the $758.7 million jackpot, as well as two tickets that won $1 million prizes. He says they transcribed it incorrectly.

Sweeney issued an apology for the confusion created by the error, but said lottery staff remained thrilled that a jackpot winning ticket and two $1 million winning tickets were sold in Massachusetts.

___

9 a.m.

The Massachusetts store that sold the winning Powerball ticket was initially told it sold a $1 million ticket, not the only ticket that won the $758.7 million jackpot.

Mike Donatelli, a spokesman for the Pride Station & Store in Chicopee, Massachusetts, says they were told shortly before 8 a.m. that the store had actually sold that ticket. The jackpot is the largest grand prize won by a single lottery ticket in U.S. history.

Donatelli says the founder of the chain, Bob Bolduc, plans to hold news conferences at 10 a.m. and at noon. The store is part of a chain that operates in western Massachusetts and northern Connecticut.

The Chicopee store will receive $50,000 for selling the winning ticket.

Lottery officials had initially said a different store, near Boston, had sold the winning ticket. That store actually sold a ticket that won $1 million.

___

8: 30 a.m.

The error by the Massachusetts State Lottery over which store sold the lone winning Powerball ticket is being blamed on nerves.

Michael Sweeney, the lottery's executive director, tells WBZ-AM they had a ""couple of excited people at 1 o'clock in the morning"" but said if there's any blame to be placed, the buck stops with him.

The lottery initially said a convenience store in Watertown had sold the winning ticket. A few hours later, it announced it had made a mistake, and that the winning ticket was sold across the state at the Pride Station & Store in Chicopee, in Western Massachusetts.

Sweeney says the lottery had not yet heard from the winner.

He said the Chicopee store will receive $50,000 for selling the winning ticket, he said.

He said the store in Watertown did sell a ticket that won a $1 million prize.

___

8 a.m.

Massachusetts State Lottery officials have corrected the site where the single winning ticket for the Powerball $758.7 million jackpot was sold to Chicopee, not Watertown.

The Massachusetts State Lottery had announced around 2:30 a.m. Thursday that a convenience store in Watertown, near Boston, had sold the winning ticket.

But shortly before 8 a.m., the lottery said it had made a mistake, and that the winning ticket was sold across the state at the Pride Station & Store in Chicopee, in Western Massachusetts.

The lottery did not say how the error was made .

Dave Grohl Delivers Food to First Responders Fighting California Wildfires,Dave Grohl delivers food to first responders fighting California wildfires.,1.0,"Dave Grohl is showing his appreciation for the first responders who have been working tirelessly to help contain the blazes that have spread throughout California.

The Foo Fighters frontman visited a number of fire stations in SoCal on Monday, providing free dinners to a number of firefighters and their families from his new Backbeat Barbeque project.

The official Instagram account for Fire Station 68 in Calabasas, California, shared a photo of Grohl on site, captioning it, ""It was awesome to get a visit tonight from Dave Grohl of the @foofighters. He also treated us to some of his own @backbeatbbq . Thanks Dave! It was excellent!""

""How cool is this?"" a wife of a firefighter from the Los Angeles Fire Department added. ""Dave Grohl and his family brought home cooked BBQ to babes station last night.""

Grohl also shared a series of pics to Backbeat Barbeque's Instagram, thanking the first responders for their selfless work battling the fires and helping to restore communities.

""To all the @losangelesfiredepartment and @lacountyfd heroes we met last night...thank you,"" the post read. ""It was an honor to cook for you. - Dave.""

While not much is known about Backbeat Barbeque just yet, Grohl first announced his plans to launch the BBQ-focused project while speaking to GQ in May.

""I have spent far too long lost down a YouTube wormhole, watching videos on how to make the best spice rub for the perfect brisket,"" he said at the time. ""When I get back to L.A. I’m taking a butchery course.""

Another celebrity who fed responders was Guy Fieri. The Auburn Police Department's Twitter shared a photo of the chef with an officer on Sunday, after he stopped by to cook a pulled pork dinner for everyone.

""Guy Fieri is in this photo with Officer Joe Almeida up in Butte County #CampFire Guy is cooking pulled pork dinner for everyone this evening,"" the tweet read. ""He had also thanked everyone that is helping out for their hard work! Thank you Guy for your time, support and great food! #ButteCounty.""

Marcus Rashford: Man Utd forward becomes youngest person to top Sunday Times Giving List,"At 23, the Manchester United and England footballer Marcus Rashford has become the youngest person ever to top the Sunday Times Giving List. The striker has donated £20 million to food, poverty and community charities – a sum greater than his personal wealth.",1.0,"Manchester United and England forward Marcus Rashford has become the youngest person to top The Sunday Times Giving List - the annual measure of philanthropy among the super-rich.

The ranking sets the sums donated to or raised for charity against the Rich List wealth valuation for those individuals or families.

Rashford, who also appears in the Young Rich List for the first time with a fortune put at £16m, successfully lobbied the UK Government into a U-turn over its free school meals policy during the coronavirus lockdown, ensuring children in need would receive free meals throughout the summer.

The 23-year-old was awarded an MBE in October 2020 for services to vulnerable children during the pandemic and has since formed a child food poverty task force, linking up with some of the nation's biggest supermarkets and food brands.

Acting as an ambassador for FareShare, Rashford's efforts triggered an estimated £20m of additional donations to the food poverty charity. This gives him a Giving Index of 125 - the £20m representing 125 per cent of his net worth of £16m.

Lindsay Boswell, FareShare chief executive, said: ""We are delighted he's been honoured in this way. Marcus' support for FareShare over the last year and his commitment to tackling child hunger has simply been incredible.

""His own experience of relying on free school meals to eat brings authenticity and compassion to his campaigning, and his status as a Premier League footballer means people and politicians sit up and take notice.""

Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson also features in this year's Giving List, ranked sixth, to mark his role in raising £4m for the NHS from fellow Premier League footballers through the #PlayersTogether coronavirus appeal.

In January, Henderson was named the first NHS Charities Together 'Champion'. The role means he will act as an ambassador for the organisation which supports staff, volunteers and patients within the NHS and raises funds for more than 240 related charities.

For the first time, donations tracked by The Sunday Times exceeded £4 billion, representing a 36.1 per cent rise on last year.

Donations have been more widely based than ever, with 182 Rich Listers among the £1 million-plus donors in the past year, beating the previous record of 177 set in 2016.

The Sunday Times Giving List recorded nine donations of more than £100m and 71 gave at least £10m, up from 42 recorded in 2020.

Covid-19 has fuelled the giving spree and The Sunday Times Giving List have tracked £520m of donations to this end alone, covering PPE supplies, the alleviation of food poverty, community support and the vital area of helping to plug the cumulative £10 billion funding gap in the finances of charities up and down the country.

Poteau Police Officer Adopts Child After Investigating His Case Of Severe Child Abuse,Police Officer Adopts Child After Investigating His Case Of Severe Child Abuse,1.0,"POTEAU (KFSM) — In 2015, Poteau Police Officer Jody Thompson said he was pulling into the parking lot of work when a call of child abuse went out. “...

POTEAU (KFSM) -- In 2015, Poteau Police Officer Jody Thompson said he was pulling into the parking lot of work when a call of child abuse went out.

""I thought I would respond to the call with on duty officers to see if I could give any kind of assistance,"" Thompson said.

It was at that moment when Thompson arrived that he met his future son. He responded with quite a bit of emotion when asked at what point he knew he would never leave the then 8-year-old's side.

""When I seen him. When I seen him in that house..I knew,"" Thompson said.

Poteau Police Chief Stephen Fruen explained what happened in that child abuse case.

""Based on some of the case facts, when we found him he was bound by his hands and feet with rope and had been submerged in a trash can, held in the shower,"" Fruen said. ""They weren't feeding him. He didn't have much to eat. I think what he did get to eat he got at school. Bruises, he was covered in bruises from head to toe.""

Investigators said the little boy was taken to the hospital by officer Thompson, who stayed by his side while recovering in the intensive care unit.

""And the rest is kind of history,"" Thompson said.

Thompson and his wife adopted John Thompson and have given him a life where they say he excels.

""He means everything in the world that we live in. He's the strongest person I've ever met. He means the world,"" Thompson said.

John Thompson is a straight A student and in the gifted and talented program at his school, his dad says.

When asked what his dad means to him, John Thompson responded quickly and assertively.

""He was helpful to me. He's the reason why I'm here right now,"" John Thompson said.

The Thompson's story doesn't end there. While going through the process of adoption with John, they learned John's biological mom gave birth to a baby girl in jail. The Thompson's took her in as well.

""We picked her up at the hospital. She was barely 24 hours old and we brought her home,"" Thompson said.

Fruen said his officer sets a standard for care and compassion in law enforcement.",http://5newsonline.com/2017/06/29/poteau-police-officer-adopts-child-after-investigating-his-case-of-severe-child-abuse/
Twin Cities Doctor Creates $50 EpiPen Alternative,Twin Cities Doctor Creates $50 EpiPen Alternative,1.0,"MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) — Dr. Douglas McMahon, with the Allergy and Asthma Center of Minnesota in Eagan, has created an Epinephrine (EpiPen) alternative that he is trying to get on the market.

“I’ve been working on this for many years,” McMahon said. “I actually have severe food allergies myself, so I’ve need to carry an Epinephrine device for many years. Throughout that process I’ve realized the current device is really big and cumbersome, to the point where I hardly ever carried it.”

He says you never know when you are going to have a severe reaction, so it is important to keep the medicine with you at all times.

He says he started tinkering around his lab several years ago and created a smaller device, which he calls AllergyStop.

“By chance I came to realize how inexpensive the parts were, including the medicine, and I realized we can sell it to patients for a very reasonable cost,” McMahon said.

A double pack of EpiPens is currently being sold for $600 by the device maker Mylan. They were sold for $57 in 2007.

MacMahon is in the process of raising millions of dollars to get AllergyStop to patients.

“It cost an incredible amount of money and time and effort,” McMahon said. “I have a patent on my device and one of these advisors says, ‘It probably doesn’t even matter because it’s so hard to take a product to market, you really won’t have any competitors.'”

McMahon needs to take AllergyStop through “human factor” studies to pass FDA standards. The tests will make sure the medicine inside his device stays sterile and potent for a certain period of time.

It is also exposed to heat, cold and sunlight. He says the testing will cost around $2 million. He is taking bids right now from manufactures to produce AllergyStop.

McMahon says companies like Mylan may have lost sight of patient needs and are catering to investors. He believes that is why we are seeing these skyrocketing prices for EpiPens.

“I’m a patient that uses this device and I would prescribe this device, so I know both sides of the field,” McMahon said.

He started a fundraising campaign one month ago using Indiegogo.com. Funding has been slow.

He says he plans to open up AllergyStop to investors, but hopes he does not run into issues, like investors looking to jack up the price from $50.",http://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2016/09/13/epipen-alternative/
Why forests are spreading in the rich world,"Forests are spreading in the rich world. ""In 1990 28% of Spain was forested; now the proportion is 37%.""",1.0,"FORESTS in countries like Brazil and Congo get a lot of attention from conservationists, and it is easy to see why. South America and sub-Saharan Africa are experiencing deforestation on an enormous scale: every year almost 5m hectares are lost, net. But forests are also changing in rich Western countries. They are growing larger, both in the sense that they occupy more land and that the trees in them are bigger. What is going on?

Forests are spreading in almost all Western countries, with the fastest growth in places that historically had rather few trees. In 1990 28% of Spain was forested; now the proportion is 37%. In both Greece and Italy, the growth was from 26% to 32% over the same period. Forests are gradually taking more land in America and Australia. Perhaps most astonishing is the trend in Ireland. Roughly 1% of that country was forested when it became independent in 1922. Now forests cover 11% of the land, and the government wants to push the proportion to 18% by the 2040s.

Two things are fertilising this growth. The first is the abandonment of farmland, especially in high, parched places where nothing grows terribly well. When farmers give up trying to eke out a living from olives or sheep, trees simply move in. The second is government policy and subsidy. Governments have protected and promoted forests for diverse reasons, ranging from the need for wooden warships to a desire to promote suburban house-building. Increasingly they welcome forests because they are carbon sinks. The justifications change; the desire for more trees remains constant.

The greening of the West does not delight everyone. Farmers complain that land is being taken out of use by generously subsidised tree plantations. (They get subsidies, too, but the ones for tree-planting are especially generous.) Parts of Spain and Portugal are afflicted by terrible forest fires. These burn especially hot in areas with lots of eucalyptus trees—an Australian import that was planted for its pulp but has spread of its own accord. Others simply dislike the appearance of conifer forests planted in neat rows. They will have to get used to the trees, however. The growth of Western forests seems almost as inexorable as deforestation elsewhere.",https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2017/12/12/why-forests-are-spreading-in-the-rich-world?fsrc=scn/tw/te/bl/ed/whyforestsarespreadingintherichworldtheeconomistexplains
"For North Korean soldier’s recovery, South Koreans are pinning their hopes on this doctor",North Korean defector is now conscious and stable.,1.0,"No medical drama is complete without a bold-yet-sensitive heartthrob doctor in a leading role. The incredible tale of a North Korean soldier's escape across the demilitarized zone last week is no exception.

The McDreamy in this case is Lee Cook-jong, the trauma surgeon who has operated on the soldier several times and provided updates along the way — including a video showing Lee picking 10-inch-long parasitic worms out of the man's intestines and his declaration Wednesday that the defector will survive.

“The patient is not going to die,” Lee told reporters at Ajou University Hospital south of Seoul, announcing that the man had regained consciousness and was stable.

Although he remains in the intensive care unit, he could be transferred to a general ward as soon as this weekend.

The 24-year-old North Korean soldier, who has been identified only by his surname, Oh, was shot five times as he made his brazen escape Nov. 13.

Closed-circuit television footage released by the U.S. military on Wednesday showed Oh driving a jeep southward before the vehicle became stuck in a ditch yards from the Military Demarcation Line that forms the border.

Oh jumped out and started running for the line. Four North Korean border guards tried to stop him, firing more than 40 rounds at him. One guard briefly crossed the line, violating the armistice that ended the Korean War in 1953.

The video showed Oh lying wounded in a pile of leaves against a building on the southern side. Then three South Korean soldiers crawled out and dragged him to safety.

From there, he was put in a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter and flown 50 miles south to the hospital in Suwon, where Lee was waiting.

“If it weren’t for their emergency measures, he would have died before arriving at the hospital,” Lee said.

[ Dramatic video shows North Korean soldier making a run for freedom ]

It was still touch-and-go when Oh arrived at the hospital. His blood pressure was so low after losing so much blood that the doctors did not even have time to check his blood type. Instead, they pumped about 40 units — between three and four times the amount of blood contained in a human body — of type O into him.

He has had three surgeries, including an attempt to repair his damaged internal organs and stop the contamination caused by the parasites and the injuries.

Through it all, the trauma surgeon, often in scrubs, has been giving regular updates on the soldier’s condition.

The revelation that the man had a severe parasitic infection — Lee said he had never seen such a case except in medical textbooks — and that his stomach contained raw corn kernels prompted widespread shock in South Korea. North Korean front-line soldiers were supposed to be elite troops, yet this man had worms not seen in South Korea since the 1970s and had been eating uncooked corn?

Oh also has tuberculosis and hepatitis B, Lee said. And, at 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighing about 130 pounds, he is several inches shorter and 20 pounds lighter than the average male 18-year-old South Korean.

There is intense interest in the soldier, and military intelligence officers reportedly are eager to question him about his escape, but Lee has been fending them off. The soldier is showing signs of depression and post-traumatic stress, and it will take about a month before he is well enough to answer questions, the doctor said.

For now, Lee is keeping the conversation light — talking about the way things are done in South Korea rather than asking him about North Korea — and trying to cheer him up.

The medical staff played him ""Gee,"" a peppy pop song by Girls' Generation — featuring lyrics such as, ""Oh, it's too pretty, your soul's too pretty/It's love at first sight"" — and he declared that he liked girl bands.

Lee also said Oh has been watching the American TV series “CSI” and the action movie “The Transporter,” in which a former special-forces operative hires himself out as a mercenary.

The staff also has hung a South Korean flag in his room to reassure him he really is in the South.

[ Escaped North Korean soldier fights for life after being shot crossing DMZ ]

This is not Lee’s first time in the spotlight. The surgeon became a national hero in 2011 when he saved the life of a ship captain who had been shot by Somali pirates.

After pirates seized a chemical freighter near the Gulf of Aden in 2011, South Korean commandos stormed the ship and the pirates shot the captain six times during the rescue attempt.

Lee was waiting at a hospital in Oman and saved the captain’s life, earning a reputation as the country’s leading trauma surgeon. There was even a popular medical drama based on this story, “Golden Time.” The title was a reference to Lee’s frequent reminder that it is the hour after a severe injury that is most important for saving someone’s life.

The 48-year-old Lee, who is blind in one eye and renowned for working 36-hour shifts, was also the inspiration for a character in another drama, “Romantic Doctor, Teacher Kim,” released last year. He became such a celebrity that even octogenarians with diabetes were trying to get in to see him.

Lee became a doctor in South Korea but trained as a critical-care surgeon at the University of California at San Diego Medical Center in 2003. He then went on to the Royal London Hospital’s trauma center.

Returning home, he realized that there was no equivalent facility at any hospital in South Korea and estimated that about 30,000 trauma patients were dying in the country each year because of treatment delays and a lack of dedicated trauma units.

He persuaded authorities to fund proper trauma centers, including his unit at Ajou University Hospital. Now, 20 percent of revenue from traffic fines goes to trauma centers in the country.

[ American detained trying to enter North Korea; North Korean soldier escapes to the South ]

But for a trauma surgeon, Lee faces a predicament that is unimaginable for American ER doctors: He seldom gets to treat gunshot wounds, because South Korea has very strict rules on gun ownership.

Ten murders with a firearm were reported in South Korea between 2010 and 2015, compared with 8,592 in the United States, according to figures from the Small Arms Survey.

Instead, the relatively few gunshot wounds he has treated have been sustained by South Korean and U.S. soldiers hurt during military drills, he told the Korea Times in 2015. Still, that appears to have been enough practice to save the North Korean soldier's life.

Now, South Koreans are waiting for Lee’s next statement on the soldier’s prognosis.

In online forums, South Korean “netizens” have been sending their best wishes to Lee and his patient.

“A Korean who put his life on the line to cross over to the south. Hopefully he can be saved!” wrote one in an online medical forum.

Another added, “Please survive so you can live in South Korea!”

"Michigan girls escape kidnap attempt by fighting, throwing hot coffee on suspect","Michigan girls escape kidnap attempt by fighting, throwing hot coffee on suspect",1.0,"The girls were leaving a convenience store when they were attacked.

Police in Michigan say four girls managed to fight off a man who assaulted them over the weekend by throwing hot coffee on him.

The girls, ages 11 to 14, were leaving a gas station convenience store in Millington, Michigan, last week when a man grabbed one of the girls by the hair and attempted to kidnap her, according to police.

Officers with the Millington Police Department said the suspect, identified as 22-year-old Bruce Hipkins, followed the girls last Friday night and eventually grabbed one them “around the head and told her she was coming with him.”

“The other three girls kicked, hit, and threw their hot coffee on him,” the department said in a statement Saturday. “The suspect let the young girl go and grabbed another one of the girls by her hair. The suspect was again kicked and hit by the girls until he let her go and fled on foot.”

Two of the girls, sisters Allison, 11, and Lauren Eickhoff, 13, described the scary ordeal in an interview with Flint ABC affiliate WJRT on Monday.

""He said, 'You're coming with me.' And like, he grabbed my face,"" Allison added. ""This cannot be happening; I thought it was a test at first, but then I'm like, 'This is real.'""

Lauren said she screamed and immediately jumped into action. She said their father told them to fight back whenever they felt they might be in danger.

""I grabbed my drink and chucked it at his head. I tried, I punched him in the head,"" Lauren said. “Seeing that your little sister was going to get taken is very scary.""

The girls escaped to a nearby hotel and called for help. There were no injuries reported.

Officers caught up with Hipkins later on and arrested him on charges of unlawful imprisonment, assault and battery and two counts of criminal sexual conduct, police said.

Hipkins is being held at the Tuscola County Jail on a $250,000 bond. It was unclear if he had obtained an attorney as of early Tuesday.",https://abcnews.go.com/US/michigan-girls-escape-kidnap-attempt-fighting-throwing-hot/story?id=57163812
‘I know they are going to die.’ This foster father takes in only terminally ill children,single Dad takes in the terminally ill foster kids no one else will,1.0,"The children were going to die.

Mohamed Bzeek knew that. But in his more than two decades as a foster father, he took them in anyway — the sickest of the sick in Los Angeles County’s sprawling foster care system.

He has buried about 10 children. Some died in his arms.

Now, Bzeek spends long days and sleepless nights caring for a bedridden 6-year-old foster girl with a rare brain defect. She’s blind and deaf. She has daily seizures. Her arms and legs are paralyzed.

Bzeek, a quiet, devout Libyan-born Muslim who lives in Azusa, just wants her to know she’s not alone in this life.

“I know she can’t hear, can’t see, but I always talk to her,” he said. “I’m always holding her, playing with her, touching her. … She has feelings. She has a soul. She’s a human being.”

He’s the only one that would take a child who would possibly not make it. Melissa Testerman, Department of Children and Family Services intake coordinator

Of the 35,000 children monitored by the county’s Department of Children and Family Services, there are about 600 children at any given time who fall under the care of the department’s Medical Case Management Services, which serves those with the most severe medical needs, said Rosella Yousef, an assistant regional administrator for the unit.

There is a dire need for foster parents to care for such children.

And there is only one person like Bzeek.

“If anyone ever calls us and says, ‘This kid needs to go home on hospice,’ there’s only one name we think of,” said Melissa Testerman, a DCFS intake coordinator who finds placements for sick children. “He’s the only one that would take a child who would possibly not make it.”

Typically, she said, children with complex conditions are placed in medical facilities or with nurses who have opted to become foster parents.

But Bzeek is the only foster parent in the county known to take in terminally ill children, Yousef said. Though she knows the single father is stretched thin caring for the girl, who requires around-the-clock care, Yousef still approached him at a department Christmas party in December and asked if he could possibly take in another sick child.

This time, Bzeek politely declined.

The girl sits propped up with pillows in the corner of Bzeek’s living room couch. She has long, thin brown hair pulled into a ponytail and perfectly arched eyebrows over unseeing gray eyes.

Because of confidentiality laws, the girl is not being identified. But a special court order allowed The Times to spend time at Bzeek’s home and to interview people involved in his foster daughter’s case.

The girl’s head is too small for her 34-pound body, which is too small for her age. She was born with an encephalocele, a rare malformation in which part of her brain protruded through an opening in her skull, according to Dr. Suzanne Roberts, the girl’s pediatrician at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles. Neurosurgeons removed the protruding brain tissue shortly after her birth, but much of her brain remains undeveloped.

She has been in Bzeek’s care since she was a month old. Before her, he cared for three other children with the same condition.

“These kids, it’s a life sentence for them,” he said.

Bzeek, 62, is a portly man with a long, dark beard and a soft voice. The oldest of 10 children, he came to this country from Libya as a college student in 1978.

Years later, through a mutual friend, he met a woman named Dawn, who would become his wife. She had become a foster parent in the early 1980s, before she met Bzeek. Her grandparents had been foster parents, and she was inspired by them, Bzeek said. Before she met Bzeek, she opened her home as an emergency shelter for foster children who needed immediate placement or who were placed in protective custody.

The key is, you have to love them like your own. Mohamed Bzeek

Dawn Bzeek fell in love with every child she took in. She took them to professional holiday photo sessions, and she organized Christmas gift donation drives for foster children.

She was funny, Bzeek said during a recent drive home from the hospital. She was absolutely terrified of spiders and bugs, so much that even Halloween decorations creeped her out — but she was never scared by the children’s illnesses or the possibility that she would die, Bzeek said.

The Bzeeks opened their Azusa home to dozens of children. They taught classes on foster parenting — and how to handle a child’s illness and death — at community colleges. Dawn Bzeek was such a highly regarded foster mother that her name appeared on statewide task forces for improving foster care alongside doctors and policymakers.

Bzeek started caring for foster children with Dawn in 1989, he said. Often, the children were ill.

Mohamed Bzeek first experienced the death of a foster child in 1991. She was the child of a farm worker who was pregnant when she breathed in toxic pesticides sprayed by crop dusters. She was born with a spinal disorder, wore a full body cast and wasn’t yet a year old when she died on July 4, 1991, as the Bzeeks prepared dinner.

“This one hurt me so badly when she died,” Bzeek said, glancing at a photograph of a tiny girl in a frilly white dress, lying in a coffin surrounded by yellow flowers.

By the mid-1990s, the Bzeeks decided to specifically care for terminally ill children who had do-not-resuscitate orders because no one else would take them in.

There was the boy with short-gut syndrome who was admitted to the hospital 167 times in his eight-year life. He could never eat solid food, but the Bzeeks would sit him at the dinner table, with his own empty plate and spoon, so he could sit with them as a family.

There was the girl with the same brain condition as Bzeek’s current foster daughter, who lived for eight days after they brought her home. She was so tiny that when she died a doll maker made an outfit for her funeral. Bzeek carried her coffin in his hands like a shoe box.

“The key is, you have to love them like your own,” Bzeek said recently. “I know they are sick. I know they are going to die. I do my best as a human being and leave the rest to God.”

“I know she can’t hear, can’t see, but I always talk to her,” Mohamed Bzeek says. (Genaro Molina / Los Angeles Times)

Bzeek’s only biological son, Adam, was born in 1997 — with brittle bone disease and dwarfism. He was a child so fragile that changing his diaper or his socks could break his bones.

Bzeek said he was never angry about his own son’s disabilities. He loved him all the same.

“That’s the way God created him,” Bzeek said.

Now 19, Adam weighs about 65 pounds and has big brown eyes and a shy grin. When at home, he gets around the house on a body skateboard that his father made for him out of a miniature ironing board, zooming across the wood floor, steering with his hands.

Adam studies computer science at Citrus College, driving his electric wheelchair to class. He’s the smallest student in class, Bzeek said, “but he’s a fighter.”

Adam’s parents never glossed over how sick his foster siblings were, and they told him the children were going to eventually die, Bzeek said. They accepted death as part of life — something that made the small joys of living all the more meaningful.

“I love my sister,” the shy teenager said of the foster girl. “Nobody should have to go through so much pain.”

About 2000, Dawn Bzeek, once such an active advocate for foster children, became ill. She suffered from powerful seizures that would leave her weak for days. She could hardly leave the house because she didn’t want to collapse in public.

The frustrations of her illness wore on her, Bzeek said. There was stress in the marriage, and she and Bzeek split in 2013. She died a little over a year later.

Bzeek chokes up when he talks about her. When it came to facing the difficulties of the children’s illnesses, the knowledge that they would die, she was always the stronger one, he said.

:::

On a chilly November morning, Bzeek pushed the girl’s wheelchair and the IV pole that carries her feeding formula into Children’s Hospital on Sunset Boulevard. She was wrapped in a soft pink blanket, her head resting on a pillow with the stitched words: “Dad is like duct tape holding our home together.”

The temperatures had been bouncing up and down that week, and the girl had a cold. Her brain cannot fully regulate her body temperature, so one leg was hot while the other was cold.

On the elevator, her face glowed bright red as she coughed, her throat filled with phlegm, screaming for air. People in the elevator looked away.

Bzeek rubbed her cheek playfully and held her hand, waving it playfully. “Heeeey, mama,” he cooed in her ear, calming her down.

For Bzeek, the hospital has become a second home. When he’s not here, he’s often on the phone with her many doctors, the insurers who fight over who’s paying for it all, the lawyers who represent her and her social workers. Any time they leave the house together, he carries a thick black binder filled with her medical records and pages of medications.

Still, Bzeek — who had to be licensed through the county to care for medically fragile children and receives about $1,700 a month for her care — is not able to make medical decisions for her.

Roberts entered the exam room, smiling at the girl’s frilly socks and brown dress with fall-colored leaves.

“There’s our princess,” the doctor said. “She’s in her pretty dress, as always.”

Roberts has known Bzeek for years and has seen many of his foster children. By the time this girl was age 2, Roberts said, doctors said there were no more interventions to improve her condition.

“Nobody ever wants to give up,” she said. “But we had run through the options.”

But the girl, who is hooked to feeding and medication tubes at least 22 hours a day, has lived as long as she has because of Bzeek, the doctor said.

“When she’s not sick and in a good mood, she’ll cry to be held,” Roberts said. “She’s not verbal, but she can make her needs known. … Her life is not complete suffering. She has moments where she’s enjoying herself and she’s pretty content, and it’s all because of Mohamed.”

Other than trips to the hospital and Friday prayers at the mosque — when the day nurse watches her — Bzeek rarely leaves the house.

To avoid choking, the girl sleeps sitting up. Bzeek sleeps on a second couch next to hers. He doesn’t sleep much.

:::

On a Saturday in early December, Bzeek, Adam and the girl’s nurse, Marilou Terry, had a celebratory lunch for the child’s sixth birthday. He invited her biological parents. They didn’t come.

Bzeek crouched in front of the girl — wearing a long, red-and-white dress and matching socks — and held her hands, clapping them together.

“Yay!” he said, cheerfully. “You are 6! 6! 6!”

Bzeek lit six birthday candles in a cheesecake and sat the girl on the kitchen table, holding the cake near her face so she could feel the warmth of the flames.

As they sang “Happy Birthday,” Bzeek leaned over her left shoulder, his beard gently brushing the side of her face. She smelled the smoke, and a small smile crossed her face.

5-Year-Old Girl Now Cancer-Free After Dentist Noticed Tumor in Her Jaw During Routine Visit

Visiting the dentist isn’t just good for your oral health — it could save your life.

During a routine check-up last year, Dr. Harlyn Susarla, ordered a panoramic X-ray for Hunter Rose Jones, then 4, when she noticed the child had several loose teeth, which was unusual for her age, ABC affiliate KOMO News reported. The Washington-based dentist then discovered a tumor growing in the child’s jaw.

Get push notifications with news, features and more.

“I was freaked out,” the girl’s mother, Kara Jones, told the outlet. “I was at the dentist. You don’t — tumor? No.”

That September, Hunter began treatment at Seattle Children’s Hospital, where she was diagnosed with Stage 4 neuroblastoma, a rare childhood cancer that often starts in the abdominal area, according to the Everett Herald.

Hunter’s father told KOMO News that doctors also found a tumor in their daughter’s abdomen, where the cancer had originated, and that it had “spread to her hip as well.”

Over the next 140 days, Hunter underwent a variety of treatments at the hospital, including two tumor removals, five rounds of chemotherapy and two stem cell transplants, according to KOMO News.

Although the aggressive treatment has caused Hunter hearing loss, she is now cancer-free.

“The fact that this was something that was found in the dental chair – I’m grateful that I saw this and that she was able to get the care and the treatment that she needed,” Dr. Susarla told KOMO News. “Honestly, I probably think about her every day.”

Although Hunter is currently in remission, her family has created a GoFundMe to help raise funds for her continuing treatment, which could include a possible 12-month trial in New York City.

Member of India's lowest caste expected to be elected president,Member of India's lowest caste expected to be elected president,1.0,"A member of India’s poorest and most oppressed caste is expected to be elected president.

Ram Nath Kovind, the governor of Bihar until last month, was announced as the nominee of Narendra Modi’s government in June, in what was widely seen as part of a decades-long strategy by Hindu nationalists to win over members of the dalit (Untouchable) community.

Nearly 5,000 Indian state and federal members of parliament took part in a secret nationwide ballot on Monday to decide the next president using specially designed violet ink pens with unique serial numbers.

The five-year post has significant responsibility under India’s constitution, but similar to other Westminster-style governments, it is largely ceremonial in practice.

The result of the collective parliamentary votes will not be known until Thursday, but Kovind, 71, has secured wide cross-party support and is expected to comfortably beat Meira Kumar, the former diplomat and MP nominated by the opposition Congress party and its allies.

Kovind and Kumar are dalits, highlighting the community’s symbolic and electoral significance.

Dalits, officially known as scheduled castes, were traditionally thought to fall outside the four castes that determined the shape of Hindu lives, from jobs and diets to marriage prospects.

As a result, they were considered “impure” and banished to the periphery of Indian society, suffering thousands of years of exclusion and extreme poverty that affirmative action programmes in the past 70 years have done little to address.

In historical examples popularised by the dalit leader BR Ambedkar, members of the caste in one village were forced to wear spittoons around their necks to collect their impure saliva, while in another, they had to tie branches to their waists “so as not to leave any unclean footprints”.

Badri Raina, a Delhi University professor for four decades, said winning dalit support had become essential to the vision of Hindu unity promoted by Modi’s Bharatiya Janata party.

The BJP argues that India’s culture and institutions are inherently Hindu in nature, a premise that dalits have traditionally eyed with suspicion, seeing in the party’s platform the priorities of the same upper-caste Hindus who oppressed them.

Propelled by canny politics and Modi’s charisma, the BJP has recently made inroads into segments of the dalit community, but faces significant hurdles, especially when it comes to the key party priority of cow protection.

“Dalit livelihoods have been predominantly dependent on the cattle industry, both for nutrition and the leather market, yet there, the BJP has made no concessions,” Raina said.



In Gujarat last year, seven young dalit men who skinned a dead cow, an “unclean” role traditionally carried out by members of the caste, were filmed being publicly flogged by self-styled cow vigilantes, triggering significant protests.

Meat industry regulations introduced in May banning the market sale of cows and other livestock for slaughter are also thought to have hit dalits hardest, along with Muslims, another of India’s poorest social groups.

In May, an advance team for the BJP chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, Yogi Adityanath, reportedly gave dalit villagers soap and asked them to clean themselves before an official visit.

If elected, Kovind would be the second dalit president after KR Narayan, who held the post for five years from 1997.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jul/17/india-ram-nath-kovind-dalit-caste-presidential-election
Australia slashes plastic bag use by 80 percent in just 3 months,Australia slashes plastic bag use by 80 percent in just 3 months,1.0,"Down Under is overcoming plastic pollution.

In only three months, Australia has cut its plastic bag usage by 80 percent, according to the country’s National Retail Association.

Over the summer, two of Australia’s largest supermarket chains — Woolworths and Coles — announced the ban of single-use plastics in their stores in the Australian states of Queensland and Western Australian.

Australia has approached the phase-out of lightweight plastic bags on a regional level, rather than national. Tasmania and South Australia have previously banned plastic bags and Victoria is expected to enact a ban sometime in 2019. New South Wales – the country’s most populated state – is the only region without any pending plans.

The chains said the ban was initially met with such outrage that Woolworths experienced flailing sales. And one Coles shopper was reportedly so frustrated he couldn’t get a free plastic bag that he threatened an employee and grabbed him by the throat. This led to Coles sporadically backtracking on the 11-cent tax for a reusable plastic bag and handing them out for free, citing customers’ struggle to adjust. (They’ve since reinstated the tax.)

But, customers have since adjusted and the ban has proven successful — preventing as many as 1.5 billion bags from polluting the environment.

“Retailers deserve an enormous amount of kudos for leading the way on one of the most significant changes to consumer behavior in generations and we also applaud shoppers for embracing this environmental initiative,” David Stout, manager of industry policy at the National Retail Association, said in a statement.

Throughout the world, at least 32 countries — 18 in Africa — have plastic bag bans in place, according to ReuseThisBag. In June, Chile became the first country in the Americas to ban plastic bags. California and Hawaii are the only US states with a plastic bag ban. However, a handful of states have a mandatory recycling or reuse program.

A Girl Scout troop in Narberth, Pennsylvania recently helped pass legislation to ban straws and tax plastic bags, making the small town the first in the state to ban single-use plastics.

“Everyone delivering things in a package needs to take responsibility for what they deliver it in,” Stout said. “I think there’s going to be a lot more pressure on all of us to be more aware of what we consume.”",https://nypost.com/2018/12/05/australia-slashes-plastic-bag-use-by-80-percent-in-just-3-months/

SAGINAW COUNTY, Michigan (WJRT) — Some Mid-Michigan animal control officers will soon be in the dog house.

But they’re not in trouble, they’re trying to raise awareness about a serious issue.

Officers at Saginaw County Animal Control take calls every day about animals, especially dogs, left out in the elements too long.

“We’re their voice, we’re the ones that step up to the plate for them,” said Officer Joaquin Guerrero.

Guerrero and two other officers hope their voices are heard loud and clear on Jan. 12.

From 6 p.m. until 8 a.m. the next day, they plan to sleep outdoors at Apple Mountain in Thomas Township.

Two of the officers will be in custom-made dog houses being made by prisoners at the Saginaw Correctional Facility.

The third officer will be without shelter.

“It’ll fit to our body size so we’re able to crawl in and sit down in them,” Guerrero said.

They’ll have some straw inside, and then the officers will try to stay warm, just like a dog would.

“Lot of times when people become dog owners they think, ‘Oh they’re a dog, they can sustain, do whatever.’ But they’re not educated for the summer weather, the fall, the spring, the winter, and we run into these problems,” Guerrero said.

Officer Guerrero will be joined by his partner, “Little Chief.” Students from Hemmeter Elementary will be there too.

The 16-week-old German Shepherd will be safely inside for most of the night, as will the students.

The Hemmeter students will be there to monitor the officers’ temperatures and comfort levels throughout the night for a school project.

Throughout the night Guerrero will do Facebook Lives for people who don’t want to brave the elements with him.

“My goal, my personal goal is to make it through the night,” Guerrero said.

To simulate another challenge outdoor dogs face, Guerrero will have a chain. It’s meant to illustrate what it’s like for dogs who are tied up and can’t find a warm place to curl up.

“They’re stuck there, they can’t move, they can’t let their natural instincts kick in for them,” Guerrero said.

There will be medical personnel there too to make sure the officers are okay, unlike many pets who don’t have that safety net.

“We’ve got to be that voice for them. We’ve got to help them so it doesn’t happen, so we don’t find these animals frozen. And that, we can’t save them all, but the ones we can save, or the awareness we can bring, that just keeps educating more people and more people,” Guerrero said.

Guerrero said community members are welcome to stop by and cheer them on. They will also be taking monetary donations for the Saginaw County Animal Care Center. Money raised will go to caring for the animals.",http://kfor.com/2018/01/04/animal-control-officers-to-sleep-in-dog-houses/
Sweden to reach its 2030 renewable energy target this year,Sweden to reach its 2030 renewable energy target this year,1.0,"Image: Swedish Energy Agency

Sweden is on target to meet one of its renewable energy targets years ahead of schedule, and it’s thanks in part to wind turbines.



In 2012, Norway and Sweden reached a joint agreement to increase their production of electricity from renewable energy sources by 28.4 terawatt hours (TWh) by 2020.

Sweden then increased its target, with the aim of adding another 18 TWh by 2030.

Taking into account the number of wind turbines already built, plus planned wind turbine investments for the remainder of the year, Sweden is on track to hit its 2030 target - possibly by the end of the year.

Sweden’s energy target

Image: Swedish Energy Association

By the end of 2018, Sweden will have installed 3,681 turbines, with a capacity of 7,506 MW and an estimated annual production of 19.8 TWh.

“After the decision on the increase in ambition was reached, a lot of investment decisions have been taken and many wind turbines are set to be completed in the upcoming years,” Markus​ Selin, analyst at the Swedish Energy Agency, told the World Economic Forum.

According to the Agency, the ambitious targets set for renewables production are now well within reach.

“15.2 TWh of renewable energy projects are in construction today, of which 11.6 TWh is wind power,” he added.

“The joint goal of 28.4 TWh will be exceeded by about 10 TWh. This leaves about 8.7 TWh of the Swedish ambition increase of 18 TWh.”

Energy goals

Sweden has ambitious goals for energy and climate adaptation. It has set a target of 50% more efficient energy use by 2030, and 100% renewable energy production by 2040.

It also has a target of net zero emissions of greenhouse gases by 2045.

As part of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, the EU set a renewable energy directive that sets a binding target of 20% final energy consumption from renewable sources by 2020.

The vast majority of EU countries are well on track to reach their 2020 binding targets for renewable energy.

The global picture



Since 2010, global installed renewables capacity has been increasing steadily at about 8 to 9% annually, which is more than double the average growth for non-renewables.

In 2017 alone, an additional 167 GW of renewable capacity was installed globally. That is enough to power a country the size of Brazil. The biggest increases were seen in wind and solar.",https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/07/sweden-to-reach-its-2030-renewable-energy-target-this-year

Guy Fieri has helped raise more than $20 million by partnering with the National Restaurant Association Educational Foundation, he announced in an interview with TMZ. He and the organization have been sending restaurant workers $500 grants through the newly created Restaurant Employee Relief Fund.

After less than two months, Fieri has awarded more than 40,000 grants. During the interview on Thursday, he said the total amount they have raised is $21.5 million.

“I started thinking about my brothers and sisters in the restaurant business, and a bunch of restaurants that I was closing — we gotta do something,” he said.

The “Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives” star said he personally reached out to several food service companies, like Pepsi, Coke and Uber Eats, to donate money to the charitable cause.

“I started sending personal video invitations to all the heavy-hitter CEOs that are involved in the restaurant business,” he said. “As long as the money comes in, we’re going to continue to give these grants.”

Most restaurants and bars around the country have been closed in the wake of the shelter-in-place rules during the coronavirus pandemic. Certain locations have been able to stay in business with curbside pickup and delivery, and more seek to reopen as the restrictions relax. Fieri urged people to order from small, mom-and-pop restaurants and show their support.

“They need your takeout, they need your delivery so if they’re available, please go give them some biz,” he said. “It helps pay the electricity and the insurance.”",https://variety.com/2020/biz/news/guy-fieri-raises-more-than-20-million-for-restaurant-workers-affected-by-coronavirus-1234602930/
"France wants to ban sale of gas and diesel cars by 2040, end coal by 2022","France wants to ban sale of gas and diesel cars by 2040, end coal by 2022",1.0,"In an address on Thursday, France’s environment minister, Nicolas Hulot, said that the country would aim to phase out electricity from coal-fired plants by 2022 and end the sale of gas and diesel internal combustion cars by 2040.

This first goal should be relatively easy to attain. France relies heavily on nuclear energy—more than 70 percent of the country’s energy mix is nuclear—and coal-fired plants only contribute to around four percent of France’s electric production. Hulot also said that he hoped to reduce the amount of nuclear energy in the country’s energy mix down to 50 percent by 2025, although, according to Le Monde, the environment minister admitted he does “not have all the answers.”

In addition, Hulot noted a law would be proposed later this year to potentially end any new operating licenses for oil, gas, and coal mining.

The automotive goal is more of a stretch. Although details on how the French government would do this are scarce, Le Monde reports that part of the plan will involve offering money to qualifying households to replace their pre-1997 gasoline or pre-2001 diesel cars.

Hulot called the end of the sale of gas and diesel cars “a public health agenda” and mentioned Volvo’s recent commitment to only sell electric or hybrid vehicles by 2019. Engadget notes that the French government owns a considerable stake in PSA, owner of Peugeot and Citroen, as well as Renault. Regulators could potentially affect auto manufacturer operations through internal pressure. Hulot didn’t say whether plug-in hybrid electric vehicles would be factored into the ban or not. The minister admitted that achieving the goal would likely burden automakers.

Recent numbers from Germany reflect how daunting moving a country’s transportation sector away from fossil fuels can be. And an International Energy Agency report from June noted that, without government incentives, getting people to buy electric vehicles is especially challenging.

On the other hand, a report from Bloomberg Energy Finance released this week suggests that electric vehicles will outsell internal combustion vehicles in 20 years, due to falling battery prices. “The Bloomberg New Energy Finance forecast says adoption of emission-free vehicles will happen more quickly than previously estimated because the cost of building cars is falling so fast,” Bloomberg wrote. “The seismic shift will see cars with a plug account for a third of the global auto fleet by 2040 and displace about eight million barrels a day of oil production—more than the seven million barrels Saudi Arabia exports today.”",https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/07/france-wants-to-ban-sale-of-gas-and-diesel-cars-by-2040-end-coal-by-2022/

An Australian family have literally struck gold after finding a valuable gold nugget during a Mother's Day outing.

The family from Bendigo in Victoria, who asked to remain anonymous, were walking their dog — fittingly named Lucky — on the outskirts of town on Sunday morning when the daughter kicked something hard lying on the ground.

At first, the father and his two daughters were unsure of what they had found — but it has since been confirmed by experts as a 624 gram gold nugget with an estimated value of at least $35,000 ($37,000).

""I actually walked right past it but my daughter pretty much kicked it as she was walking. She then goes — dad, is this gold? I said, I think it might be,"" the father told the Bendigo Advertiser.

The stunned family first took their find to an IGA supermarket to weigh it, with the rock coming in at 624 grams, or 20 ounces.

The father said he had been informed the nugget would likely be worth more than the A$35,000 estimate if it was sold whole, and that he did plan to sell it eventually.

He said the unexpected windfall had come at a crucial time.

""We've come on some tough times so it's really good because we've been struggling financially. It couldn't be better timing really,"" he told the Bendigo Advertiser.

""Just having it at home, I've been like where do we store it? I haven't been sleeping very well and we think it's best just to sell it.""

He said the ""really random find"" had inspired the family to return to the site and look for more gold lying beneath the surface.

""Usually when you find a nugget that big, there will be more gold around so hopefully that's the case,"" he told the publication.

However, it's not the first time an Aussie has struck it rich.

Last September, a huge gold nugget worth at least A$110,000 was uncovered by a retired prospector in remote Western Australia.

That find weighed in at a hefty 3.23 kilograms and was dubbed ""Duck's Foot"" because of its unique shape.

And in 2017, Surfers Paradise gold digger Greg Cooke made headlines after finding several gold nuggets on a northern Gold Coast beach over several visits.

In fact, Australia is famous for its treasure trove of gold nuggets, with eight of the world's 10 largest found in the country over the years.

The ""Welcome Stranger"" nugget, pictured below, weighing between 2380 and 2284 ounces, is the biggest ever found on the planet and was discovered at Moliagul, near Dunolly in Victoria, in 1869.",https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&objectid=12230581
Tasmanian tiger sightings raise questions about extinct Australian predator,"People are reporting sightings of the Tasmanian tiger, thought to be extinct",1.0,"A Tasmanian tiger, which was declared extinct in 1936, displayed at the Australian Museum in 2002.

(CNN) —

The Tasmanian tiger, a large striped carnivore, is believed to have gone extinct over 80 years ago – but newly released Australian government documents show sightings have been reported as recently as two months ago.

Tasmania’s Department of Primary Industries, Parks, Water and Environment (DPIPWE) recently released a document detailing eight reported sightings of the Tasmanian tiger, or thylacine, in the last three years.

The thylacine, a marsupial that looked like a cross between a wolf, a fox, and a large cat, is believed to have gone extinct after the last known live animal died in captivity in 1936. It had yellowish brown fur, with powerful jaws and a pouch for its young, according to the Australian Museum.

While stories abound that some continue to live in the remote wilds of Tasmania, an island state off Australia’s south coast, there has been no hard evidence to support this – only claims of sightings, like the ones newly released.

One report last February said that two people, visiting Tasmania from Australia, were driving when an animal with a stiff tail and striped back walked onto the road.

The animal “turned and looked at the vehicle a couple of times” and “was in clear view for 12-15 seconds,” the report read. Both people in the car “are 100% certain that the animal they saw was a thylacine.”

Another report filed the same month described a striped “cat-like creature” moving through the mist in the distance.

“I am accustomed to coming across most animals working on rural farms … and I have never come across an animal anything close to what I saw in Tasmania that day,” the report read.

In 2017, another driver reported seeing a possible thylacine near the Deep Gully Forest Reserve in northwestern Tasmania. He didn’t see stripes, but he was about 150 meters (492 foot) away – likely too far to have seen that level of detail. He “seemed certain that if it was a cat it was a bloody big one,” the report said.

Most recently in July, a man in southern Tasmania, near the state capital of Hobart, reported seeing a footprint that seemed to match that of the Tasmanian tiger.

These reports reflect just how large the thylacine still looms in the collective imagination. Native to Tasmania and the Australian mainland, it was the only member of the Thylacinidae family to survive into modern times, according to the Australian Museum.

European colonists killed thousands of thylacines for attacking sheep.

Today, the thylacine still remains a major component of Tasmanian culture. It maintains almost Loch Ness Monster status, with regular claims of unsubstantiated sightings. In 2002, scientists at the Australian Museum even replicated thylacine DNA, opening the door to potentially bringing back the species with cloning technology.",https://www-m.cnn.com/2019/10/16/australia/tasmanian-tiger-intl-hnk-scli/index.html?utm_term=link&utm_medium=social&utm_source=fbCNN&utm_content=2019-10-16T12%3A30%3A14&fbclid=IwAR3cUPdnDYJaXkfd85_4zhM14BzU9OIoiUi07CzNN8aBvk61qehbdKW9qqs&fbclid=IwAR3o95UnId_2H5w6TtxGKXDrqFX0pdfNxCRBeZtcsmSZgpqA0ExbR-1MUAg&r=http%3A%2F%2Fm.facebook.com&rm=1
Meet the First Woman to Win the “Nobel Prize of Mathematics”,"Iranian Maryam Mirzakhani Becomes the first woman in history to win the Fields Medal (Often considered the ""Nobel Prize of Mathematics"")",1.0,"Let our journalists help you make sense of the noise: Subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter and get a recap of news that matters.





On Wednesday, Maryam Mirzakhani became the first woman in 78 years to be awarded the prestigious Fields Medal, considered the highest honor in mathematics. She was selected for “stunning advances in the theory of Riemann surfaces and their moduli spaces.”

The Fields Medal is awarded every four years by the International Mathematical Union to outstanding mathematicians under 40 who show promise of future achievement. With the announcement of Mirzakhani and this year’s other awardees—Arthur Avila, Manjul Bhargava, and Martin Hairer—there now have been 54 male and 1 female medalists.

Many hope Mirzakhani’s Fields medal is a sign of change to come. “I will be happy if it encourages young female scientists and mathematicians,” she said in a press release. Christiane Rousseau, vice president of the International Mathematics Union, told the Guardian this is “an extraordinary moment” and “a celebration for women,” comparable to Marie Curie’s barrier-breaking Nobel prizes in physics and chemistry in the early 20th century.

And as Canadian math professor Izabella Laba wrote: “Mirzakhani’s selection does exactly nothing to convince me that women are capable of doing mathematical research at the same level as men. I have never had any doubt about that in the first place…What I take from it instead is that we as a society, men and women alike, are becoming better at encouraging and nurturing mathematical talent in women, and more capable of recognizing excellence in women’s work.”

Mirzakhani’s accomplishment is all the more groundbreaking in light of the well-documented disadvantages and biases women face in math and science. According to the National Academy of Sciences, there are no significant biological differences that could explain women’s low representation in STEM academic faculty and leadership positions (although that doesn’t stop prominent people from making claims otherwise.) Instead, NAS says we can thank bias and academia’s “outmoded institutional structures.”

For example, in a 2008 Yale study, professors were asked to rate fictional applicants for a lab manager position. When given an application with a male name at the top, professors rated the candidate more competent and hirable than when given an otherwise identical form with a female name. This bias was found in both male and female faculty members.

And that’s not all women in STEM fields have to contend with: A July report found that a full 64 percent of women in various scientific fields were sexually harassed while doing fieldwork.

These disadvantages—along with a history of men getting the credit for discoveries and inventions made by women—help explain why only 9 to 16 percent of tenure-track positions in math-intensive fields at the top 100 US universities are held by women. According to the American Mathematical Society, the share of women earning Ph.D.s in math has remained stagnant for decades:

(Additional AMS data used in the above chart found here.)

Mirzakhani, who grew up in Iran before earning her Ph.D. at Harvard and becoming a professor at Stanford, told the Clay Mathematics Institute in 2008 that she did not initially realize her strength in math: “I don’t think that everyone should become a mathematician, but I do believe that many students don’t give mathematics a real chance. I did poorly in math for a couple of years in middle school; I was just not interested in thinking about it. I can see that without being excited mathematics can look pointless and cold.”",http://www.motherjones.com/mixed-media/2014/08/maryam-mirzakhani-first-woman-fields-medal-mathematics
Academic writes 270 Wikipedia pages in a year to get female scientists noticed,Academic writes 270 Wikipedia pages in a year to get female scientists noticed,1.0,"Jess Wade is a scientist on a mission. She wants every woman who has achieved something impressive in science to get the prominence and recognition they deserve – starting with a Wikipedia entry.

“I’ve done about 270 in the past year,” says Wade, a postdoctoral researcher in the field of plastic electronics at Imperial College London’s Blackett Laboratory. “I had a target for doing one a day, but sometimes I get too excited and do three.”

That science doesn’t attract enough girls and has ground to make up in supporting and celebrating its women can feel like a tired refrain in academia. But Wade’s approach is refreshing and infectious.

“I kind of realised we can only really change things from the inside,” she says. “Wikipedia is a really great way to engage people in this mission because the more you read about these sensational women, the more you get so motivated and inspired by their personal stories.”

Ever since Darwin’s time women have been fighting back. I suddenly realised I can do this: I can change it

Wade went to an all-girls school and, with both her parents being doctors, science was a backdrop to her childhood. She does not recall encountering barriers on her way to gaining a place to study physics as an undergraduate at Imperial. When she started, the course was so tough and she was so focused on doing well, it barely registered that there weren’t many girls around.

It was only as a PhD student that she was struck by how being in a minority can shape day-to-day experiences. “Being isolated is hard – this goes for all underrepresented groups,” she says. “Then there are all those challenges during your PhD that amplify that isolation. If you don’t have anyone you can really get on with around you it’s so, so hard.”

Wade started giving talks at schools and became engaged in outreach to encourage girls to take up science, but quickly became frustrated with much of the work going on under the “women in science” banner.

The projected messages often felt fundamentally negative, such as the “9% is not enough” tagline of a 2016 campaign by the Institution of Engineering and Technology.

“If I heard something was only 9% of girls when I was at school I would’ve been, ‘Like, no’,” says Wade. Worse still was the European commission’s bungled attempt to give science a sexy, feminine makeover in its Science: it’s a girl thing! video, in which three young women prance around on a catwalk while decoding the chemical composition of lipsticks and nail varnish.

“It infuriates me that even for a blink of an eyelid they think that kind of thing will change anything,” Wade tells me through gritted teeth.

Many of the initiatives are backed by a significant amount of funding – Wade estimates £4m to £5m is spent annually on women in science outreach, with big contributions from banks and engineering firms as well as the government. “It’s not just a few academics going out and doing talks in schools, it’s huge investments of money,” she says. Yet there appeared to be little or no evaluation as to whether the projects had achieved their aims – and the evidence was not encouraging.

In the UK, the percentage of female A-level physics students has stagnated at about 21% for the past decade and for computing the proportion of A-level students who are female is just 10%”. In Britain, fewer than 9% of professional engineers are women – a figure that is among the worst globally and which has not increased in the past decade. A recent study suggests it would take 258 years to close the gender gap in physics, based on current rates of progress.

“There’s so much energy, enthusiasm and money going into all these initiatives to get girls into science,” she says. “Absolutely none of them is evidence-based and none of them work. It’s so unscientific, that’s what really surprises me.”

Wade began to look into what had been shown to work best: speaking to parents and teachers, for instance, rather than just focusing solely on pupils.

After seeing the reach achieved by uploading scientific images on to Wikimedia Commons, the free photo-sharing site, she decided to do the same for scientists themselves.

Professor Kim Cobb, a US climate scientist, was her first subject. “She’s super interesting, she does really cool research on corals and she goes diving to collect samples,” she says. Soon after, Wade went to a talk by Susan Goldberg, editor of National Geographic (the first woman to hold this post), who noticed she too lacked a Wikipedia entry. “I thought ‘That’s outrageous’, so I did her page,” she says. Since then she has done hundreds more.

As we weave our way through a labyrinthine intersection between Imperial’s physics and maths buildings, Wade greets a colleague before turning to me to say: “That’s Emma McCoy, the first woman to be a professor of maths here. I made her page.”

There are inevitable critics of the project. Last week she received a message on Twitter from an Oxford PhD student accusing her of using Wikipedia to self-promote and publicise friends. “This is not what Wikipedia is about!” he wrote. “Think about the ... damage you’re causing to the Wiki community!”

She says she “knew he was wrong” but still had a wobble. However, she was met with a surge of online support. And Wade’s subjects, none of whom she had met personally before writing their entry, have been almost universally thrilled. “Professors feel really empowered when they’ve got one,” she says.

Wade’s activism is not limited to online. After reading Angela Saini’s 2017 book, Inferior, which applies scientific scrutiny to claims of sex differences and gender stereotypes, Wade started distributing copies. “I realised that this kind of bias has been penetrating through society for so long,” she says. “Ever since Darwin’s time women have been fighting back. I suddenly realised I can do this: I can change it and I can make sure other people read this too.”

She estimates she has bought and handed out 60 or 70 copies of the book, to friends, family and fellow scientists at international conferences. “About a week ago, Angela said, You’ve got to stop buying them’, and sent me 10 signed copies,” she says, before insisting I leave with a copy.

She relentlessly nominates other women for prizes, including Emma Chapman, an astrophysicist at Imperial, who was awarded the Royal Society’s Athena prize last week, and when I meet her she is surrounded by a huddle of girls on work experience who are shadowing her that day.

What does she ultimately hope to achieve? “I guess it’s to make science a better place for everyone working in it, which happens when we recognise the contributions of these awesome women,” she says. “Then the girls who do come – because they will! – will come to a much more empowering environment.”",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/jul/24/academic-writes-270-wikipedia-pages-year-female-scientists-noticed
"Saudi teen who fled family 'very, very happy to be in her new home' after landing in Toronto","Saudi teen who fled family 'very, very happy to be in her new home' after landing in Toronto, Canada",1.0,"A Saudi teen who was granted asylum in Canada after fleeing from her allegedly abusive family has arrived in Canada.

Her flight from Seoul, South Korea, landed in Toronto a day after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced his government would accept 18-year-old Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun as a refugee.

Al-Qunun, wearing a hoodie emblazoned with the word Canada, waved to reporters as she walked through Toronto's Pearson International Airport.

She was accompanied by Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland, who said al-Qunun will be going to her unspecified ""new home.""

""She is obviously very tired after a long journey. And she preferred to go and get settled,"" Freeland said of al-Qunun, who declined to speak to reporters.

Al-Qunun did, however, take some time to pose for photographs with Freeland.

""She wanted Canadians to see that she's here, that she's well and that she is very, very happy to be in her new home,"" Freeland explained.

Social media campaign to #SaveRahaf

The young woman fled her family while visiting Kuwait and flew to Bangkok, where she barricaded herself in an airport hotel and launched a Twitter campaign that drew global attention to her case.

Al-Qunun says her father physically abused her and tried to force her into an arranged marriage.

Her father, who arrived in Bangkok not long before she left, has denied those allegations.

""I'm the girl who ran away to Thailand. I'm now in real danger because the Saudi Embassy is trying to force me to return,"" said an English translation of one of her first posts to Twitter. The teen also wrote that she was afraid and that her family would kill her if she were returned home.

The Twitter hashtag #SaveRahaf ensued, and a photo of her behind a door barricaded with a mattress was seen around the world.

Trudeau announced Friday that the United Nations High Commission for Refugees asked Canada to take al-Qunun as a refugee, and Canada agreed.

""That is something that we are pleased to do because Canada is a country that understands how important it is to stand up for human rights, to stand up for women's rights around the world,"" Trudeau said.

UNHCR spokeswoman Lauren La Rose praised Canada's willingness to step up and assist in this case, but noted that al-Qunun's situation highlights a need for more interventions around the world.

""Canada has been a great ally and leader in this area, but there needs to be more spaces so that women and girls or anyone that is vulnerable can find a safe third country to resettle in,"" La Rose said.

Starting a life in Canada

COSTI, a Toronto-based non-profit that helps newly arrived immigrants and refugees, will assist al-Qunun as she adjusts to a new life. As a government-sponsored refugee, she will have access to government assistance for up to 12 months.

""This is a young woman who is determined to make a future,"" said Mario Calla, executive director of COSTI.

""It's not going to be all smooth sailing for her, when one considers the fact that she has had to leave her family, to leave a familiar culture and social connections. It's not going to be an easy process for her,"" he added.

According to Calla, al-Qunun has some contacts in the city and has reached out to them. On Saturday afternoon, she went shopping to buy winter clothes.

'A single woman to be in a dangerous situation is one too many' News 1:32 Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland says Canada believes 'very strongly' that women's rights are human rights 1:32

In the coming days, representatives from COSTI will help her open a bank account, apply for a social insurance number and obtain a health card, Calla explained. Then they will try to find her permanent housing. Calla said he's not sure if she intends to stay in Toronto in the long term.

For now, al-Qunun is staying at a facility that has security guards present at all times.

""We have advised her to be careful about disclosing her location. She's taken a position in terms of leaving Saudi Arabia where some may disagree with her and may have strong opinions about that. We're being careful to protect her from that,"" Calla said.

He added that there may be an increase in asylum seekers using social media as a tool to reach out to governments and agencies to make their case for being granted asylum.

""There are many, many people in desperate situations — desperate in the sense that their lives are in danger. They will do anything to get out of those situations to safety so it may be a tool that some will use,"" he said.

Tensions with Saudi Arabia

The move to accept al-Qunun could serve to heighten tensions between Canada and Saudi Arabia.

In August, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman expelled Canada's ambassador and withdrew his own envoy after Freeland used Twitter to call for the release of women's rights activists who had been arrested in the country.

The Saudis also sold Canadian investments and recalled their students from universities in Canada.

But Trudeau appeared unfazed by the possibility that the move could have ill effects, repeating that Canada stands up for human rights regardless of diplomatic consequences.

Freeland echoed that sentiment in comments to reporters Saturday.

""It is absolutely the case that there are many women, far, far too many women, who are in dangerous situations both in Canada and around the world,"" she said.

""But rather than cursing the darkness ... I believe in lighting a single candle and, where we can save a single person, where we can save a single woman, that is a good thing to do.""

A 'dangerous precedent'

However one former diplomat questioned the Canadian government's actions in this instance, saying it sets a ""very dangerous precedent"" for future cases.

David Chatterson served as Canada's ambassador to Saudi Arabia from 2009 to 2011.

""What happens the next time a teenage girl or adult woman from Saudi Arabia that flees her family and declares herself to no longer be a Muslim, does that mean automatic sanctuary? One would almost conclude so from the actions taken in this case,"" he said in an interview with CBC News Network.

He added that the normal process of assessing a refugee claim can take several years in Canada.

""All of that was sort of set aside"" in this case, Chatterson said.",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/saudi-runaway-woman-1.4976076
Nigerian neurosurgeon takes pay cut to perform free operations,Nigerian neurosurgeon takes pay cut to perform free operations,1.0,"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) Neurosurgeons are known as skilled operators. But straddling surgeries across two continents? That's a different skill entirely.

Dr. Olawale Sulaiman, 49, is a professor of neurosurgery and spinal surgery and chairman for the neurosurgery department and back and spine center at the Ochsner Neuroscience Institute in New Orleans. He lives in Louisiana, but splits his time between the US and Nigeria, spending up to 12 days each month providing healthcare in the country of his birth -- sometimes for free.

Born in Lagos Island, Lagos, Sulaiman says his motivation comes from growing up in a relatively poor region.

""I am one of 10 children born into a polygamous family. My siblings and I shared one room where we often found ourselves sleeping on a mat on the floor,"" he told CNN.

Oregon high school student is making clear face masks so the hearing-impaired can be safe during coronavirus crisis,Oregon high school student is making clear face masks so the hearing-impaired can be safe during coronavirus crisis,1.0,"Medical experts recommend wearing face masks in public to slow the spread of the coronavirus, but Sunset High School junior Eric Kim could see a problem.

For those who are hearing impaired and rely on lip-reading, a mask becomes a barrier to communication.

“Everyone knows masks are in a real shortage right now,” Kim said. “Even when I go to the store, I can’t buy a regular mask because they are sold out everywhere.”

Try finding one made out of clear fabric.

Kim, who had a sudden and unexplained loss of hearing in his left ear as a sixth grader, has been a volunteer at the Tucker Maxon School. Tucker Maxon serves hearing-impaired students through the fifth grade.

“I wondered how those kids there would even be able to get masks and communicate so they could live life normally,” Kim said.

At about the same time, Kim saw a CNN report about 21-year-old Ashley Lawrence, who was hand-making clear masks in Kentucky. If she could it, Kim decided, he could too.

Kim contacted Lawrence to get the basics, found some clear fabric at a local Dollar Tree store and, with the aid of his mom’s sewing machine, went to work.

He had no background in sewing but didn’t let that stop him.

“It was a lot harder than I thought,” he said. “It took like three or four hours. The hardest part is outlining the fabric and making room for the clear, fabric square in the middle so people can read lips.

“Also, we had to insert pipe cleaners on the top and bottom to adjust for the noses, so the mask doesn’t fog up.”

He had some early help from his mom, but essentially this was a learn-as-you-go operation.

“It took a lot of mistakes with the materials before I got used to it,” Kim said.

The Dollar Tree only had so much clear fabric. Lately Kim has been going online to replenish.

Kim doesn’t charge for masks and ships them free of charge to anyone who asks. He has sent up a GoFundMe account to pay for materials and shipping.

“We’ve had a lot of small donations from people in the community,” he said.

As of Wednesday afternoon, Kim had sent out 13 completed masks, some to places as far away as New Jersey and San Antonio. The requests haven’t stopped coming.

“As long as people keep requesting, I’ll be making masks whenever I have time,” he said.

Iowa woman who fostered more than 600 children says she loved them 'like they were my own',Iowa woman honored for fostering more than 600 children,1.0,"(CNN) Linda Herring always wanted a big family. But she never imagined that she would foster more than 600 children and turn her home into a safe haven where every child was given shelter, food, clothing, and most importantly, endless amounts of love.

Now 75 years old, Herring has been fostering children for nearly five decades in Johnson County, Iowa.

Herring and her husband, Bob, began fostering when they lived in Oxford, Iowa, and continued to do so after they moved to Tiffin.

""My best friend was doing foster care for teenage girls and I thought, 'Well, that would be nice to do the same,' but I wanted little kids,"" Herring told CNN. ""So, I talked to the Department of Human Services and agreed to take kids with medical needs.""

As a foster mom, Herring ran a home daycare for local families and worked as a night custodian in a nearby high school. If that wasn't enough, she also volunteered as a first responder for nearly 50 years

Herring was known by everyone in Johnson County for never turning away a child, no matter their age, gender, or special needs, and would regularly travel to pick up foster children who needed a home.

Fostering turned into adopting

Herring is not just a foster mom. For her eight children, three of which were foster children she and Bob adopted, she was just ""Mom.""

One of those children is 39-year-old Anthony Herring. He was 6 months old when he was placed in the Herring household. When he was 3 years old, the Herring family officially adopted him.

""I appreciate being adopted even more today as a parent then I did when I was a child,"" Anthony Herring told CNN. ""I'm forever grateful for the life I was given. She and Dad have both taught me that family isn't determined by blood, it's who you have in your life to love.""

He said that his mom taught him how to appreciate and understand children with special needs.

Linda Herring holds the resolution from the Johnson County Board of Supervisors honoring her for fostering more than 600 children.

Two of Herring's adopted foster children have severe medical and special needs. One of them, Dani, is fully dependent on others for care. While Dani wasn't expected to live long after her birth, she is now 29 years old.

Herring passed on what she likes to call her ""foster care trait."" Four of her biological children have fostered children, and three of them followed their parents' footsteps and adopted kids of their own. Three of her grandchildren fostered children as well.

""It's hard to say in words her impact. She was always available and ready for a child in need. These kids were usually taken from a traumatic situation and she'd take them in, provide a warm bed, clean clothes, warm meals, and love,"" Anthony said.

""She also worked hard to keep families together. Keeping siblings together. Helping biological parents make the changes needed to be able to keep their children. She always makes sure a new child in her home was given a professional photograph that was placed on the wall in the living room. That seems like a small thing, but it helps them feel like they're at home.""

Everything comes from love

When it comes to Herring's inspiration to foster children, she had one explanation: love.

""I would just love (my foster kids) just like they were my own, probably more than I should,"" Herring said.

""I cried when the kids would leave my home, no matter how long they had been there. It was so hard for me to say goodbye to them. I always questioned, 'Why do I keep doing this?' because it was never easy to say goodbye to a child. But I kept doing it because I had so much love to give to these children in need.""

Herring carries with her memories of each child that she has protected and loved. Once, she said, she was called in by DHS in the middle of the night to pick up three young children who had been abandoned.

Another memory is the look on the face of a young girl she fostered when she saw her brand-new clothes, the first new clothes the little girl said she was ever given.

While Herring's time as a foster parent is over, she enjoys the photos and cards she receives from the children she fostered after they've been adopted. Her favorite part is when her foster children come back to visit after they've grown up.

Herring's impact as a foster mom went beyond the children she took in. Tonya Stratton, whose mother was one of Herring's foster children, grew up calling Herring ""Grama Linda"" and spending her childhood making friends with Herring's foster kids.

""Grama Linda, it's now your time to relax, but first you must learn the definition of that and then learn to sit without rocking, learn to appreciate quiet, no more piles and piles of laundry to fold, groceries to buy, diapers to change,"" Stratton said in a Facebook tribute to Herring

""It's your time now to rest, go through your memories, put your feet up or take a nap and try to understand how incredibly worthy you are to do whatever the hell you want.""

'She would meet anywhere to get a child'

In October 2019, Herring chose to stop fostering children due to health concerns, her granddaughter, Amber Herring, told CNN.

After announcing her decision to stop, Herring was honored by the Johnson County Board of Supervisors, with a resolution of appreciation on Thursday.

""The Department of Human Services would call Linda in the middle of the night to take a child, and she would meet anywhere to get a child,"" the resolution said in recognition of Herring's efforts.

""Linda mostly fostered young children with special medical needs and kept bins of clothes in her garage, stacked to the ceiling, labeled by size and gender. No one had to worry about a child going without clothes at Linda's, even if they arrived with nothing but what they're wearing.""",https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/11/us/iowa-woman-fostered-600-children-trnd/index.html
"Republic of Congo names new national park, home to gorillas, elephants","The Republic of Congo has created its fifth national park, protecting western lowland gorillas, chimpanzees, elephants and other threatened wildlife.",1.0,"The new Ogooué-Leketi National Park is the Republic of Congo’s fifth national park.

It borders Batéké Plateau National Park in neighboring Gabon, and together the two parks form a transboundary protected area covering more than 5,500 square kilometers (2,120 square miles).

The official designation of Ogooué-Leketi National Park comes after three logging concessions that overlapped with the proposed park area were finally closed down.

All of the rights-holding communities that live close to the Ogooué-Leketi National Park were involved in the process of creating the protected area, according to the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Congo program.

The Republic of Congo has officially created its fifth national park, lending protection to great apes, forest elephants and other threatened wildlife.

The new Ogooué-Leketi National Park spans 3,500 square kilometers (1,350 square miles), and borders Batéké Plateau National Park in neighboring Gabon. Together, the two national parks form a transboundary protected area covering more than 5,500 square kilometers (2,120 square miles).

Ogooué-Leketi is also part of the Batéké Plateau landscape, a unique patchwork of large rolling savannas on sandy hills, interrupted by long strips of dense forests and turquoise-blue river valleys. This savanna-forest complex is home to several threatened species, some found nowhere else in Congo, according to a press release from the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Congo program, which has been surveying the area with the country’s Ministry of Forestry Economy since 2004.

In 2009, the IUCN identified the region in which the park sits today as a priority conservation site for the protection of the critically endangered western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) and the endangered central chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes troglodytes), said Mark Gately, country director for WCS-Congo.

The forest sector of the new park is also home to several other species, such as the African forest elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis), forest buffalo (Syncerus caffer nanus), red river hog (Potamochoerus porcus), and several species of monkey including the iconic mandrill (Mandrillus sphinx). The savanna part of the national park, too, hosts a wide range of wildlife. The park has at least six species of rare savanna plants that are specialists of the Kalahari Sands, the substrate that forms the Batéké Plateau, and other savanna specialists like the bush duiker (Sylvicapra grimmia), side-striped jackal (Canis adustus), and several species of birds. The national park area was in fact identified by BirdLife International as a site of high importance for bird conservation in 2007.

The official designation of Ogooué-Leketi National Park comes after three logging concessions that overlapped with the proposed park area were finally closed down. Logging activity had expanded into the proposed protected area since 2013, Gately said, with loggers searching mainly for okoumé trees (Aucoumea klaineana) for use in plywood. All three logging companies, which are still active around the periphery of the park, completed logging within parts of the concessions overlapping the park in December 2016.

“With the support of the Congolese Minister of Forestry Economy, Mrs. Rosalie Matondo, the creation of the park has eliminated logging activity within the protected area boundaries, securing the closed canopy forest habitat that covers roughly a third of the park,” Gately said.

The roads and bridges that the logging companies built into the proposed park area have, however, facilitated commercial bushmeat hunting. Such hunting “is currently the biggest threat to the area’s wildlife and this trade links to cities like Pointe Noire and Brazzaville but also across [the] border towards Gabon,” Gately said.

“Great ape numbers have declined significantly in the area since 2010 and elephants, even if their population seems stable, recently started changing their behaviour — visiting forest clearings more at night than during the day, behaviour that is generally observed in elephant populations that perceive threats from humans in their habitat,” Gately added.

With the logging companies out, the government and WCS-Congo are now working with local communities to draw up a management plan for the national park. While no villages existed inside the area now designated as Ogooué-Leketi National Park, there are five villages very close to the park boundary. The residents of these villages have traditionally used the national park area for their needs, and continue to depend on the forest for their sustenance.

All of the rights-holding communities living near the national park were involved in the process of creating the protected area since the project was launched, Gately said. The boundaries of the protected area were mapped to ensure the villages weren’t incorporated into the national park. The communities also helped identify and map areas of cultural and traditional importance to them.

“The participatory mapping process led the government to … highlight any cultural or natural resource use zones that overlap with critical high ecological value areas, including bais [swampy, mineral-rich meadows], that will be integrated into the park under eco-development zones,” Gately said. “In these identified areas, which will be integrated into the management plan of the park, rights-holding communities will be able to continue traditional and subsistence-based gathering, fishing or hunting. The maps including the limit of the future park and the eco-development zones were validated for each village in order to ensure full consent.”

In news that doesn't sting, a recent study found that Michigan bee populations are up 50% since 2018.New data published by Spring Hill Nursery , which used research from the United States Department of Agriculture , ranked Michigan fourth in states with the highest bee colony growth. Michigan follows Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Maine, which came in first with a 72.86% increase since 2018.The study also identified those states losing the most bee colonies. At the top of the list is California, which reportedly lost 160,600 colonies in just two years. There's a pretty big gap between California and the state with the second-highest bee colony loss, Florida, which has lost 42,800.Despite California's dramatic colony loss, it's still home to the largest number of bees. According to the data, they're the only state in the U.S. to have more than 1 million colonies. Florida, too, has one of the highest hive counts in the country with close to 250,000.This news comes at a time when both wild and managed bee populations are suffering massive declines.Between 2018 and 2019, worldwide managed bee populations decreased by 40.7% , and, last year, researchers discovered a “ dramatic decline ” in at least 14 wild bee populations in the U.S., vital to fruit crops. This includes Michigan, where researchers have found that at least six species have declined by 50% or more in the last 20 years, and one species, the rusty patched bumblebee, has become extinct.Some regions in the world have reported losses as high as 90% in a 15-year span,reports. The leading cause in declining populations is believed to be exposure to pesticides, insecticides, parasites, and pathogens, as well as limited sources of nectar and pollen. For years, colony loss was attributed to a rare phenomenon called Colony Collapse Disorder, which occurs when worker bees abandon the queen, the hive's food supply, and some nurse bees. A colony's survival often relies on the presence of worker bee populations.",https://www.metrotimes.com/table-and-bar/archives/2020/09/14/bee-lieve-it-or-not-michigan-bee-populations-are-on-the-rise-according-to-new-data
SoDo's Duwamish River Is Visibly Healing,"Seattle's Duwamish River is visibly healing. In 2001, it was labeled as one of the most toxic sites in America. After two decades of cleanup efforts by conservationists and community groups, wildlife is now returning and the river is the cleanest it's been in 100 years.",1.0,"Photo: Trees along the Duwamish.

Many Seattleites live in this city and hardly see the river that birthed it. Perhaps, crossing the South Park Bridge, we glimpse water beyond the railings. Otherwise the Duwamish River flows mostly hidden between the Industrial District’s shipping containers and cranes and docks. Even before colonists arrived, the estuary was “an industrial area” for the Duwamish Tribe, says James Rasmussen, a former tribal council member and currently the Superfund manager for the Duwamish River Cleanup Coalition. “This was where we harvested so much for the villages to thrive.” He started his work in part because he grew up learning that the fish and wildlife and river were part of his family.

Even after a century of commercial pollution—which had the EPA label it one of the most toxic sites in the U.S. in 2001—salmon still run in the river. Residents of adjacent neighborhoods like South Park fish there. And, slowly, due to two decades of cleanup, the river is healing.

So is our relationship with it. A new book, The River That Made Seattle by BJ Cummings, tells the Duwamish’s long story. And on October 27, the Port of Seattle will announce new, community-selected names for the six parks that dot the river’s shores (currently called things like Terminal 107 Park). Rasmussen says that’s an important step to connect the river with its history and with a better future, to “create a river for all,” where industry and people can healthily coexist.

In these images taken over the last 10 years, photographer David Ryder shows the river’s multiplicity. Here is pollution and refuse: a tangle of tires like a nest of snakes rising from dark water. Here is the returning wildlife. Here are the people who gather on the river’s shores. Rasmussen says the Duwamish is probably the cleanest it’s been in a hundred years, but the work continues. “We can’t relax, we can’t stop,” he says. Like the river itself, “we have to keep moving.”

After a century of unchecked industrial waste, the river is polluted down to the sediment with PCBs, arsenic, dioxin, mercury. Spills used to be weekly and intentional, Rasmussen says. Now they’re down to two or three a year, each quickly contained.

Wildlife is returning to the Duwamish: It now has more biodiversity than anywhere else in Seattle. Here Caspian terns cover the shore near Kellogg Island.

Knowing they needed an industrial area to grow, Rasmussen says, early city planners “looked at this valley, and to them it was worthless because you couldn’t build anything on it… They started filling it with anything they could find, even rubble from the San Francisco earthquake.”

"Man invents electric car battery that lasts 1,500 miles when charged","Ex-Navy officer turned inventor signs a multi-million deal to produce his electric car battery that will take drivers 1,500 miles without needing to charge",1.0,"Imagine the satisfaction of driving your environmentally friendly electric car for 1,500 miles without having to stop to recharge the battery – a distance more than four times as far as the best and most expensive model currently on the road.

Under the bonnet is a revolutionary new type of battery which, unlike those used in conventional electric cars, can also power buses, huge lorries and even aircraft. What's more, it's far simpler and cheaper to make than the batteries currently in use in millions of electric vehicles around the world – and, unlike them, it can easily be recycled.

This might sound like a science-fiction fantasy. But it's not. Last Friday, the battery's inventor, British engineer and former Royal Navy officer Trevor Jackson, signed a multi-million-pound deal to start manufacturing the device on a large scale in the UK.

The father-of-eight battery inventor engineer, Trevor Jackson, 58 from Tavistock, Devon, who has signed a multi-million-pound deal to start manufacturing the device on a large scale in the UK

Austin Electric, an engineering firm based in Essex, which now owns the rights to use the old Austin Motor Company logo, will begin putting thousands of them into electric vehicles next year. According to Austin's chief executive, Danny Corcoran, the new technology is a 'game-changer'.

'It can help trigger the next industrial revolution. The advantages over traditional electric vehicle batteries are enormous,' he said.

Few will have heard of Jackson's extraordinary invention. The reason, he says, is that since he and his company Metalectrique Ltd came up with a prototype a decade ago, he has faced determined opposition from the automobile industry establishment.

It has every reason not to give ground to a competitor that may, in time, render its own technology obsolete. Car industry sceptics claim Trevor's technology is unproven, and its benefits exaggerated.

But an independent evaluation by the Government agency UK Trade and Investment said in 2017 that it was a 'very attractive battery' based on 'well established' technology, and that it produced much more energy per kilogram than standard electric vehicle types.

Game-changer: the aluminium-air fuel cell stores far more energy than a conventional battery

Two years ago, Jackson claims, motor manufacturers lobbied the Foreign Office to bar him from a prestigious conference for European businesses and governments at the British embassy in Paris, which was supposed to agree a blueprint for ensuring all new cars are electric by 2040. The bid to exclude him failed. Now, with the signing of the Austin deal, it seems he is finally on the road to success.

He has also secured a £108,000 grant for further research from the Advanced Propulsion Centre, a partner of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. His technology has been validated by two French universities.

He says: 'It has been a tough battle but I'm finally making progress. From every logical standpoint, this is the way to go.'

Jackson began working on new ways of powering electric vehicles after a distinguished engineering career. He worked for Rolls-Royce in Derby, helping to design nuclear reactors, then took a commission in the Royal Navy, where he served as a lieutenant on board nuclear submarines, managing and maintaining their reactors.

Before founding his own firm in 1999, he was working for BAE Systems, where he first started looking at alternative, green ways to power vehicles. By then he and his partner, Kathryn, were married. The couple have eight children, aged 11 to 27, and live in Tavistock, on the edge of Dartmoor in Devon.

In 2001 he began to investigate the potential of a technology first developed in the 1960s. Scientists had discovered that by dipping aluminium into a chemical solution known as an electrolyte, they could trigger a reaction between the metal and air to produce electricity. At that time the method was useless for commercial batteries because the electrolyte was extremely poisonous, and caustic.

After years of experimentation at his workshop in the Cornish village of Callington, Jackson's eureka moment came when he developed a new formula for the electrolyte that was neither poisonous nor caustic.

'I've drunk it when demonstrating it to investors, so I can attest to the fact that it's harmless,' Jackson says. Another problem with the 1960s version was that it worked only with totally pure aluminium, which is very expensive.

But Jackson's electrolyte works with much lower-purity metal – including recycled drinks cans. The formula, which is top secret, is the key to his device.

Technically, it should be described as a fuel cell, not a battery. Either way, it is so light and powerful that it could now be set to revolutionise low-carbon transport, because it supplies so much energy.

Jackson gave me a demonstration. He cut off the top of a can of Coke, drained it, filled it with the electrolyte, and clipped electrodes to it, powering a small propeller. 'The energy in this will keep the propeller spinning for a month,' he said. 'You can see what this technology could do in a vehicle if you scale it up.' Following last week's deal with Austin, that is exactly what is about to happen. Three immediate projects are about to go into production.

The first is to manufacture for the Asian market some 'tuk-tuks' – the three-wheeler taxis used by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge last week during their Royal visit to Pakistan. The second is to make electric bikes, which will be cheaper and run for much longer than those made by rivals.

Finally, and most importantly, the firm is to produce kits to convert ordinary petrol and diesel cars into hybrids, by fitting them with aluminium-air cells and electric motors on the rear wheels.

A driver will be able to choose whether to run the car on fossil fuel or electricity. The cost of each conversion, Jackson says, will be about £3,500, and they will be available early next year. This, he adds, will be the stepping-stone to a full-blown electric vehicle powered by aluminium-air fuel cells. The car industry has already poured massive investment into a very different type of battery, lithium-ion.

Also found in devices such as computers and mobile phones, lithium-ion batteries are rechargeable. Almost every electric vehicle on the road uses them. But they have big drawbacks. As well as lithium, they contain rare, poisonous substances such as cobalt. They can explode or catch fire, as seen with the spate of incidents that forced Samsung to recall tens of thousands of Galaxy Note 7 phones in 2016.

With repeated charging, car-sized models eventually become spent. Recycling them to recover the cobalt and lithium is extremely expensive – about five times as much as the cost of disposing them and starting from scratch.

Aluminium, on the other hand, is the planet's most abundant metal. Many of the factories that refine it from ore or recycled junk are powered by green, renewable energy, such as hydro-electric dams.

And once an aluminium-air fuel cell is spent, it can be recycled very cheaply. According to Jackson, the cost of recycling means the running costs of an aluminium-air powered car would work out at 7p per mile. The cost of a small hatchback's petrol comes to around 12p per mile. More important, lithium-ion batteries are heavy.

Accredited tests have shown that, weight for weight, Jackson's fuel cell produces nine times as much energy as lithium-ion: nine times as many kilowatt hours of electricity per kilogram. The luxury electric car maker Tesla says its model S has a range of 370 miles from one charge. Jackson says that if you drove the same car with an aluminium-air cell that weighed the same as the lithium-ion battery, the range would be 2,700 miles. Aluminium-air cells also take up less space.

Jackson claims that if the Tesla were fitted with an aluminium-air fuel cell that was the same size as its current battery, it could run non-stop for 1,500 miles – almost enough to get from Land's End to John O'Groats and back again. An average British family – whose car will travel 7,900 miles annually – would need to change their fuel cell only a handful of times each year.

Scientists call the weight-to- energy ratio 'energy density'. According to Jackson, because aluminium-air fuel cells have a much greater density than lithium-ion batteries, they could be used in buses or big trucks. If powered by lithium-ion, such vehicles would be unfeasibly heavy, with the battery weighing as much as the freight.

He says: 'You could easily stack numerous cells in this type of vehicle – after all, getting rid of their diesel fuel tanks will give you plenty of space.' Jackson adds that aluminium-air cells could also be used in aircraft. 'We are in discussions with two aircraft manufacturers. It's not going to be suitable for jets. But it would work in propeller planes, and be suitable for short-haul passenger and cargo flights.'

Meanwhile, the raw cost of a new aluminium-air cell is much lower.

In a Tesla, Jackson says, the battery costs about £30,000. An aluminium-air fuel cell that would power the same car for longer would cost just £5,000.

Drivers with cars that depend on lithium-ion have to charge their batteries from the mains when they are spent – a process that takes a long time, often overnight. But when an aluminium-air cell became exhausted, the driver would simply exchange it for a new one.

Instead of a vast network of charging points, all that is necessary are stores where cells can be swapped, just as people already swap propane gas bottles.

Swapping a battery, says Jackson, takes about 90 seconds.

He and Corcoran say they are in 'advanced discussions' with two major supermarket chains to provide this facility.

Last week, Sir James Dyson announced he was scrapping his plans to make electric cars because he had come to the conclusion they were not commercially viable, even though he had invested millions.

'The problem is,' says Jackson, 'he was using lithium-ion. If his cars had been based on aluminium-air fuel cells, the outcome might have been different.'

Ironically, Jackson's story so far bears more than a passing resemblance to Dyson's.

Dyson developed his bagless vacuum cleaner at a workshop at his home, supported by his wife.

And just as Jackson has had to battle the vested interests of the big motor companies, it took Dyson ten years to break through commercially, because no distributor or existing manufacturer was prepared to upset the lucrative market for dust bags.

'Everyone knows that if we are really going to hit the Government's target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, the hardest nut to crack is transport,' Jackson says. 'We're just not going to do that with lithium-ion. Apart from anything else, it's no use for trucks, which burn vast amounts of fossil fuel.

'I know we are battling ferocious vested interests but the technological and environmental advantages of aluminium-air are overwhelming – and Britain has a chance to become the world leader in it.'

Corcoran adds: 'If you want to do something about the environment, you can. You can do it now, with this product.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7592485/Father-eight-invents-electric-car-battery-drivers-1-500-miles-without-charging-it.html

Elderly woman who lived a quiet life gives away MILLIONS to charity after her death,Elderly woman who lived a quiet life gives away Millions to charity after her death - with even her friends and family not knowing she was rich,1.0,"Sheila Woodcock, from Newcastle in New South Wales, lived a comfortable and private life before her death in May 2018 at age 87

An elderly woman who rarely spoke of her wealth has left her $14million fortune to 15 charities.

Sheila Woodcock, from Newcastle in New South Wales, lived a comfortable and private life before her death in May 2018 at age 87.

Her second cousin Kent Woodcock said friends and family knew Ms Woodcock was well-off but they didn't know the extent of her multi-million estate until her passing.

On Wednesday, 15 of Ms Woodcock's chosen causes were invited to Broadmeadow's Westpac Rescue Helicopter Service facility where they were told the detail of her generosity.

'The charities were gobsmacked but when they realise it's 14 other charities... it's awe-inspiring,' Mr Woodcock told Newcastle Herald.

Ms Woodcock did not marry or have children and spent her life enjoying close friendships, travelling, horticulture, acting and chocolate during her long life.

Ms Woodcock, who was tight-lipped about her fortune, left her $14million to 15 charities

The charities paid tribute to Ms Woodcock's legacy during Wednesday's gathering, with her second cousin declaring it to be a 'celebration' of her life.

'I don't think anybody [in Newcastle] has ever done something like this and I don't think we'll ever see it again.

'It's not sadness at her passing, it's: ''Look what she's done, look what she's doing''.'

Mr Woodcock said the multi-millionaire was a private and independent person, who did not have a regular career and kept tight-lipped about her earnings.

Tim Crakanthorp, the state member for Newcastle, wrote on Facebook: 'Often people will leave some money to charity when they pass away, but Sheila Woodcock took that to a whole other level.'

'Sheila lived in Bar Beach and passed in 2018, bequesting an amazing $14 million to 15 community organisations.'

He shared a picture with a guide dog puppy which has been named Woody in Ms Woodcock's honour.

On top of her bequest, Ms Woodcock had donated more than $347,000 to Guide Dogs NSW/ACT over more than 30 years.

Many people want to set aside half of Earth as nature,Many people want to set aside half of Earth as nature,1.0,"Famed biologist E.O. Wilson has argued in recent years that humans should set aside half of Earth as nature, an ambitious proposition to stave off mass extinction and safeguard the bulk of our planet’s biodiversity, including its people.

Now, a new poll reveals Wilson isn’t alone in his thinking. On average, the majority of survey respondents across a dozen countries said more than half of the planet’s land and sea should be protected.

Jonathan Baillie, executive vice president and chief scientist of National Geographic Society, notes that this Half-Earth plan is necessary to meet the Paris climate target of limiting global warming to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degree Celsius) and achieve the United Nations’ sustainable development goals. “People want what is scientifically needed for us to have a secure future,” he says.

The survey, a collaboration between the National Geographic Society and Ipsos, polled 12,000 adults in Australia, Brazil, China, Great Britain, India, Indonesia, Kenya, Mexico, South Africa, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States. Researchers sought to understand how people in these countries—all places where NGS works—value nature and biological diversity, information Baillie says is vital for guiding policymakers and measuring the organization’s long-term impact.

In five countries with lower internet access—Mexico, Brazil, South Africa, Indonesia, and China—the online poll's results could be more representative of affluent, urban-dwelling citizens than of the general population—a potential limitation to the survey, researchers warn.

Though people across the globe generally support conservation and saving wildlife, the survey results also revealed a poor understanding about topics such as extinction, in part due to lack of education. (Here's what we lose when species go extinct.)

For instance, respondents in all countries were highly aware of the rapid pace of mass extinction underway, yet “they don’t know exact details or understand the extent of what we could lose,” says Baillie.

A striking majority of respondents weren’t sure how much vertebrate populations have changed since 1970 (decreased by about 60 percent). Australians and Americans were least knowledgeable that a quarter of the world’s mammals could soon go the way of the dodo.

Even with such knowledge gaps, however, one crucial takeaway from the poll is that “regardless of political or cultural backgrounds,” Baillie says, “very few people think extinction is acceptable.""

Overestimating protected areas

Concern about extinction was highest among people in Mexico, Brazil, and South Africa—countries with rich biodiversity and some of the world’s greatest and great numbers of species now at risk of extinction. Mexico has the most, with 665 endangered species, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

Only a tiny sliver of the population in all countries surveyed, an average of 2 percent, said extinction didn’t concern them. (Read how human activities are accelerating the extinction rate.)

""Very few people think extinction is acceptable.""

Another intriguing finding was that many people dramatically overestimate the amount of the natural world that is currently protected, notes Edward Maibach, director of the Center for Climate Change Communication at George Mason University in Virginia.

Overall, respondents believed roughly 35 percent of the world’s sea is preserved. In reality, just 7 percent is. It’s a similar story for land: Assumptions about how much is conserved (15 percent) varied by country, ranging from Australia, where people thought 26 percent of land is protected for nature, to India, where people thought 45 percent is.

That’s a problem, Baillie says, because it “could make the need to protect the environment seem less urgent.”

But it’s important to note, adds Maibach, that a “majority of people from these nations want to see much more land and sea protected”—and are likely to support their governments taking more actions to better conserve species and ecosystems.

‘What’s stopping us?’

1:27

Baillie and Maibach agree the survey’s results could have significant implications for the future of conservation, for instance by pressuring governments to meet public demand for conservation.

Whether governments will follow the public’s lead remains in question. An important test will be in October 2020, when delegates from nearly 200 countries will converge at the UN Convention on Biological Diversity in Beijing, China, to develop a new framework for halting biodiversity loss and establish global targets for protected areas, currently set at just 17 percent for land and 10 percent for oceans.

Protecting biodiversity in the long-term and avoiding mass extinction will require an even loftier goal: Setting aside 50 percent of the planet by 2050, with an interim milestone of 30 percent by 2030, Baillie says. (Read how extinction is a complicated issue.)

Cockrell — or Mr. DC, as the kids call him — was recently named Missouri's Teacher of the Year. He is dedicated to teaching kids physical education, but it's his backstory that helps make his achievement that much more impressive.

Mr. DC says he started at the bottom. In his acceptance speech at the Teacher of the Year Recognition Ceremony in October, he went into detail about his upbringing. ""Six-deuce-87 Kitchen Crip gangster. Yup, your 2021 Teacher of the Year used to be in a gang,"" he said.

Darrion Cockrell – or Mr. DC, as the kids call him – is a P.E. teacher in Missouri who was recently named the state's Teacher of the Year. He credits his former educators for helping shape his life. Darrion ""DC"" Cockrell

""I was born to a drug-addicted mother who had two of her six kids by the age of 16. My father was murdered when I was 4, and I began my journey in and out of the foster care system not long after my 6th birthday,"" he continued.

It was educators who helped him during his difficult childhood. ""I had a lot of struggles and a lot of hurdles and if not for those educators, I would not be here today,"" he said.

His speech sparked curiosity in his journey, and in November the school district shared more in a video about Mr. DC's life.

The teacher said growing up in St. Louis as a kid, he hated school and joined a gang at 10 years old. ""That was normal life for me. I was going down the wrong path, destined to end up just like my friends — dead or in jail,"" he said in the video.

However, two P.E. teachers in particular helped him overcome the odds. He credited the teachers for creating another world for him when the one around him wasn't going his way. In gym class, he could just be a kid, he said.

Mr. DC said at one point, he lived at a boys' home near his middle school and he said a worker there named Ken, who looked after him, also made a huge impact on his life.

""He taught me it's OK to be tough, but at the same time it's OK to be compassionate,"" he said. ""He was like a father figure to me.""

""Looking back, if it were not for this place, I would not be where I am today.""

In the video, he named several other teachers and adults in his life who helped him overcome the odds. But it was his football coach who ended up adopting him.

""No, I'm not Micahel Oher from 'The Blindside,' but I did have dreams of the NFL,"" Cockrell said in his acceptance speech, adding that the adoption changed his perspective on life. ""When I changed the way I looked at things, the things around me started to change.""

""I had a lot of challenges and a lot of hurdles, and if it were not for those educators who helped me along the way, I wouldn't be where I am today,"" he told CBS affiliate KMOV.

Now, Mr. DC is the educator, and he's not only trying to teach kids physical education, but about compassion and perseverance.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/missouri-teacher-of-the-year-darrion-cockrell-former-gang-member/

New York City, the epicenter of the state's outbreak, hit its peak number of deaths on April 7, when 590 people died in one day.

Death and hospitalizations in the city have consistently fallen since then. The city reported 26 deaths from the coronavirus on Wednesday, its most recent public data.

Leonardo DiCaprio leads $43m pledge to restore the Galápagos Islands,Leonardo DiCaprio pledges $43m to restore the Galápagos Islands | Environment,1.0,"Leonardo DiCaprio has announced a $43m (£30.4m) pledge to enact sweeping conservation operations across the Galápagos Islands, with his social media accounts taken over by a wildlife veterinarian and island restoration specialist.

The initiative, in partnership with Re:wild, an organisation founded this year by a group of renowned conservation scientists and DiCaprio, the Galápagos National Park Directorate, Island Conservation and local communities, aims to rewild the entire Galápagos Islands, as well as all of Latin America’s Pacific archipelagos.

It has a large number of supporting and implementing partners from a range of philanthropic and environmental organisations, including Galápagos National Park Directorate, Ecuador’s Ministry of Environment and Water, and Charles Darwin Foundation.

The $43m pledge will fund Galápagos projects including efforts to restore Floreana Island, home to 54 threatened species, and reintroduce 13 locally extinct species, including the Floreana mockingbird – the first mockingbird described by Charles Darwin.

The money will also pay for a captive breeding programme and other activities to prevent the extinction of the pink iguana, and strengthen measures to protect the Galápagos’s marine resources from the human impact of ecotourism.

DiCaprio said: “When I travelled to the Galápagos Islands, I met with Paula Castaño and other environmental heroes in Ecuador working day in and day out to save one of the most irreplaceable places on the planet.

“Around the world, the wild is declining. We have degraded three-quarters of the wild places and pushed more than 1 million species to the brink of extinction. More than half of Earth’s remaining wild areas could disappear in the next few decades if we don’t decisively act.

“The environmental heroes that the planet needs are already here. Now we all must rise to the challenge and join them.”

Paula A Castaño, who will take over DiCaprio’s Instagram and Twitter accounts to promote critical interventions needed to rewild the Galápagos, said: “Time is running out for so many species, especially on islands where their small populations are vulnerable and threatened.

“We need catalytic investments like the one announced today to replicate our successes in the Galápagos and elsewhere.”

Castaño, who has been working as an island restoration specialist for eight years, believes that if humans can coexist with nature, ecosystems can be rewilded successfully.

“Up to 97% of the land area of the Galápagos Islands comes under national park status. We are not trying to remove humans from the picture. We are trying to all work together to rewild these ecosystems, and support the community as well. They want to be able to continue to thrive together with nature.

“For example, in Floreana, you can see a Darwin finch right next to you. If you go to the beach, you can see sea lions somewhere in the corners basking in the sun right next to you. They don’t have that fear of humans because we work together. They don’t have the threats in other locations when they are completely afraid of humans.”

Castaño recalled successful rewilding restorations in the past. In 2012, invasive rodents were removed from the island of Pinzón by the Galápagos national park, assisted by Island Conservation to benefit the Pinzón giant tortoise. As a result, new hatchlings were discovered in 2014.

“We have seen rewilding in our lifetime, so we don’t really have to wait five years or 20 or 50 years. These are immediate results. We will see the payoff for all of these efforts, and not across only the Galápagos, but farther beyond archipelagos in Latin America.”

Marcelo Mata Guerrero, Ecuador’s minister of environment and water, said: “These kinds of partnerships that leverage technical, social and financial innovations, are exactly what we need around the world to restore the health of our planet.

“With Ecuador, as one of the 17 most biodiverse countries on the planet, we have an opportunity here to demonstrate what a truly effective model looks like for the protection and restoration of our shared wildlife and wild lands – the immune system of our planet, protecting all life on Earth, including people, from the effects of climate change and emerging disease.”

DiCaprio, a longtime champion of global environmental issues, has provided more than $100m in grants to a variety of programs and projects. He has also praised the teenage climate change activist Greta Thunberg as a “leader of our time”, and addressed the United Nations about the dangers of climate change in 2014.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/may/18/leonardo-dicaprio-pledges-43m-to-restore-the-galapagos-islands
San Francisco passes law forcing all pet shops to only sell rescue dogs and cats,San Francisco passes law forcing all pet shops to only sell rescue dogs and cats,1.0,"San Francisco officials have voted to ban the sale of non-rescue dogs and cats at pet shops as part of a concerted effort to eradicate “inhumane” puppy breeding operations in the city.

The amendment will not affect licenced breeders however it will aim to tackle the prevalence of large-scale “puppy mills”, while helping to facilitate the adoption of thousands of animals already occupying the city's shelters.

San Francisco will not be the first US city to implement such a measure, which will also ban the sale of animals under eight weeks old. Los Angeles, San Diego, Chicago, Philadelphia, Boston and Austin all enforce similar legislation.

“Most animal lovers are horrified at the thought of keeping their beloved family pet in a dirty wire cage for a second — let alone a week, month or even years. Yet, that is the fate of many animals at large-scale commercial breeding operations across the nation, including the mothers of many puppies and kittens sold in pet shops,” the San Francisco Board of Supervisors wrote in an op-ed piece.

“In response, more than 200 cities and counties across the nation have banned the sale of dogs and cats in pet stores.”

Mimi Bekhechi, animal cruelty charity PETA’s director of international programmes, praised the decision as “progressive” and example-setting.

Recommended The dark world of puppy smuggling

“With this vote, San Francisco has proved itself to be the city of love for millions of dogs and cats in desperate need of homes.

""Pet shops' greed fuels the cruel commercial breeding industry that keeps female dogs and cats prisoner inside filthy wire cages – whose only purpose is to churn out litters of inbred puppies and kittens who are then taken away from them, transported hundreds of miles, and sold,” she told The Independent.

“The city has recognised that animals are not commodities and that there's a direct link between the industry and the millions of dogs and cats in shelters around the world who are euthanised each year because there aren't enough good homes for them all.”

District 4 Supervisor Katy Tang, who sponsored the legislation, also called on the US Agriculture Department to reinstate information on its website documenting animal cruelty cases, which was removed earlier in the month.

San Francisco currently has no known pet shops selling dogs and cats, however Ms Tang said the measure would allow the city’s Animal Care and Control Department to prevent future shops opening.

“This ordinance will serve as a deterrent, preventing a business from moving into San Francisco and selling animals from irresponsible mass-producing breeders that churn out puppies and kittens as if they were on an assembly line,” she wrote.

“Beyond protecting consumers and cutting off the supply chain, this ordinance also acknowledges San Francisco businesses for their humane business practices.”

Metallica Donate a Quarter Million to Build Pediatric Hospital,Metallica Donate a Quarter Million to Build Pediatric Hospital,1.0,"In keeping with their set practice of supporting a community organization in every locale they visit, Metallica have donated 250,000 euros (about $279,000, or over a quarter-million dollars in U.S. funds) to a Romanian association building the country's first pediatric oncology hospital. It's the latest charitable pledge from the band during their ongoing ""WorldWired Tour,"" which is currently covering Europe with fellow rockers Ghost.

The donation to the Daruieste Viata (""Give Life"") nonprofit was proffered just prior to the band's sold out concert at Bucharest, Romania's Arena Națională on Wednesday (August 14), the association revealed on its Facebook page, as reported by Reuters. Read a statement regarding Metallica's contribution from the president of Daruieste Viata, Carmen Uscatu, down toward the bottom of this post.

""The final leg of the European tour starts with a very special donation,"" a press release stated. ""Together with fans attending the show at Arena Națională in Bucharest, Romania and a generous sponsorship by Mastercard, Metallica presented Daruieste Viata (The Give Life Association) with €250,000 before the concert.""

It continued, ""Inspired by Mastercard’s own €1,000,000 donation towards the Daruieste Viata project earlier this year, Metallica’s gift will contribute to the endowment of the first Pediatric Oncology and Radiotherapy Hospital in Romania with the latest medical technologies and equipment.""

The donation was made via Metallica's All Within My Hands Foundation, which hosted its Second Annual Day of Service earlier this year. Founded in 2017, All Within My Hands helps create ""sustainable communities by supporting workforce education, the fight against hunger, and other critical local services,"" its website explains.

3ders.org - India: First 3D printed titanium vertebrae implant helps 32-year-old woman walk again,India: First 3D printed titanium vertebrae implant helps 32-year-old woman walk again,1.0,"Feb 17, 2017 | By Benedict

Doctors in India have helped a 32-year-old woman back onto her feet by rebuilding part of her spine with 3D printed vertebrae in a first-of-its-kind procedure. The patient had been suffering from spinal tuberculosis.

Dr Gopal Kumar and Dr V Anand Naik created a 3D printed titanium vertebrae implant

It takes a certain degree of backbone to be a doctor, but—incredibly—it took just a 3D printer for these Indian doctors to make a backbone for a 32-year-old spinal tuberculosis patient. Using advanced metal 3D printing technology, a surgical team at Medanta The Medicity hospital in Haryana was able to create 3D printed artificial vertebrae for the woman, the first operation of its kind in India.

Under the guidance of Dr V Anand Naik, a senior consultant for spine surgeries at the hospital, the surgical team was able to replace the damaged vertebrae in the patient’s spine, replacing them with a 3D printed titanium version that bridged the gap between the first and fourth cervical vertebrae. “It was a very complex surgery and the patient’s condition was deteriorating by the day,” said Dr Naik. “It would not have been possible to do it without 3D printing technology.”

The female patient, a teacher by trade, was under the knife for a total of 10 hours, a lengthy spell necessitated by the severe damage suffered by the patient’s first, second, and third cervical vertebrae. The extent of this damage meant that there was no skeletal support available between the skull and lower cervical spine.

“The challenge for our team was to reach high into the neck without altering the position of the patient,” explained Dr Gopal Kumar, a consultant on the operating team. “The anterior approach and small working field, in cases such as these, are a necessity.”

Although such a procedure comes with many risks for the patient, the unnamed 32-year-old had an extra special reason for wanting everything to go smoothly—especially when the surgeons took the scalpel to her neck area: “As the patient is a singer, preservation of laryngeal nerve was of prime importance,” Dr Kumar said. “Swallowing, chewing, and movement of tongue—all were at risk.”

The medical team was able to create 3D printed titanium vertebrae for the patient by first obtaining CT and MRI scans of the damaged spine. 3D design software was then used to transform these scans into printable models, which were then fabricated using an unspecified metal 3D printer. Further testing was then carried out on the 3D printed implant, and help was sought from design teams from India, Sweden, and the US.

Without the 3D printed vertebrae implant, the patient could have lost her singing voice

Twelve days after the surgery, the patient was walking with minimal support and was entirely free of pain. Furthermore, her singing voice has recovered after being threatened with dysphasia, a language disorder brought about by the patient’s tuberculosis.

“This is the first such surgery in India and probably third in the world by using 3D printing technology,” Dr Naik added. “These techniques have opened a new avenue wherein any type of complex reconstruction can be done in the spine with less collateral damages.”

"Ontario's new math curriculum to introduce coding, personal finance starting in Grade 1","Ontario new math curriculum to introduce coding, personal finance starting in Grade 1",1.0,"The Ford government’s new elementary math curriculum will introduce coding, computer storage measurements and personal finance terms starting in Grade 1, as part of a bid to improve sliding EQAO math scores.

Starting this September, students in Ontario public schools will begin learning mathematics with more emphasis on a “back to basics” approach, with certain concepts introduced in earlier grades and other concepts pushed into higher ones.

Throughout grades one to eight, children will learn concepts related to coding for the first time.

They will also learn about personal finance in each grade, and they will learn about measurements of data storage, such as a byte, kilobyte, megabyte and gigabyte, alongside the other units of measurement they learned previously.

Ministry of Education officials said teachers will be given professional development time through the summer as well as during the new school year to adapt lesson plans to the changes.

“This is the first new elementary school math curriculum in 15 years – it’s clear that has a lot has changed since 2005, and our math schooling needs to change with it,” Premier Doug Ford said Tuesday.

Ontario’s official opposition said changing the curriculum during a pandemic is “irresponsible.”

“Dropping a new math curriculum during the middle of a pandemic is completely irresponsible,” NDP education critic Marit Stiles said Tuesday. “Not only has the Minister of Education failed to properly consult educators and parents about the new curriculum, he has not bothered to consider the additional burden this will cause for teachers, and for parents who are already struggling to help their children learn from home.”

Education Minister Stephen Lecce said Tuesday that now was as good a time as any to change the curriculum as declining test scores demanded a change be made.

“I appreciate the broader challenge around us but we must move forward with these necessary reforms for students so that when they graduate they can aspire to get a good paying a job, a job related to the future economy, a job that could give them a yield to own a home one day,” he said.

The new curriculum also changes when children will be introduced to some core skills.

For instance, learning to tell time on a round clock with hands will now begin in Grade 3, instead of Grade 1.

Meanwhile, plotting coordinates on a grid will be taught in Grade 4, down from Grade 6, with officials saying the skill is useful to have when learning about coding.

Part of the “return to basics” approach means memorizing multiplication tables will return.

“Yes parents, memorizing multiplication tables is back for our kids,” Lecce said.

Provincial EQAO math scores have been lagging behind reading and writing scores in the elementary grades for years.

In Grade 3, average scores were down to 61 per cent in 2018, from 67 per cent four years earlier.

In Grade 6, the average math score has been stuck at 61 per cent for a decade.

As a part of the rollout of the new curriculum, Lecce said EQAO math tests for grades 3 and 6 would be postponed for the 2020-2021 school year.

He added that in future years the annual tests could be conducted online.

The union representing public English language teachers in elementary schools said Tuesday that it had asked the province to roll out the new curriculum over two schools years and was disappointed they were moving to roll it out in one year instead.",https://www.cp24.com/mobile/news/ontario-s-new-math-curriculum-to-introduce-coding-personal-finance-starting-in-grade-1-1.4995865
"Coronavirus | COVID-19 tests must be done free, orders Supreme Court",India's supreme court has ordered all coronavirus tests to be made free,1.0,"Issue necessary directions immediately, it tells govt

Tests relating to COVID-19, whether done in approved government or private laboratories, shall be free of cost, the Supreme Court ordered on Wednesday.

Also read | Affected districts increased from 62 to 257 in a span of 15 days

Issue the necessary directions immediately, it told the government.

A Bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan and S. Ravindra Bhat held that tests relating to COVID-19 must be carried out only in NABL accredited Labs or any agencies approved by the WHO or the ICMR.

The order was passed on a petition filed by advocate Shashank Deo Sudhi to implement free COVID-19 testing by private labs. On April 3, the court issued notice to the government on the plea, which challenged the legality of a March 17 advisory capping the price for Coronavirus testing at Rs. 4500 in private labs and hospitals. Mr. Sudhi had argued that the advisory was both discriminatory and a violation of the fundamental right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution.

""We find prima facie substance in the submission of petitioner that at this time of national calamity permitting private labs to charge Rs. 4500 for screening and confirmation test of COVID-19 may not be within means of a large part of population of this country and no person be deprived to undergo the COVID-19 test due to non-payment of capped amount of ₹4500,” the court observed in its order. It pointed to the government laboratories carrying out COVID-19 tests free of cost.

The court said that private hospitals, including laboratories, have an important role to play in containing the scale of the pandemic by extending philanthropic services in the hour of national crisis. Reimbursing private labs of their expenses was a matter to be considered later on and not now, it stated.

“We thus are satisfied that the petitioner has made out a case for issuing a direction to the respondents to issue necessary direction to accredited private labs to conduct free of cost COVID-19 test,” it concluded.

The government status report in the court had said that as many as 15,000 tests were conducted a day by 118 labs.

Report: Half of McDonald’s Happy Meal customers pass on soda,Report: Half of McDonald’s Happy Meal customers pass on soda,1.0,"McDonald’s is on track to meet its goal of increasing customer access to fruit, vegetables, low-fat dairy and water, especially among Happy Meal consumers, in 20 global markets, according to an independent progress report released Tuesday by the company.

In 2013, McDonald’s developed five “balance lifestyle” goals for 2020 in partnership with the not-for-profit Alliance for a Healthier Generation. Two of the commitments included providing customers a choice of a side salad, fruit or vegetable as a substitute for French fries in value meals and promoting only bottled water, milk or juice choices for Happy Meals.

The independent progress report was conducted by Keybridge, a public policy economic consulting firm based in Washington, D.C. The company found that a majority of McDonald’s 20 major markets, including the United States, have met the 2013 commitments two years ahead of schedule. The remaining markets are on track to meet them by the 2020 deadline.

A key milestone from the report: As of September 2018, 48% of Happy Meal customers in the 20 global markets ordered milk, water or juice as their beverage choice compared to 36% as of September 2013.

While soda remains a Happy Meal option, the brand removed carbonated drinks as a choice on menu boards in 2013. That “out of sight, out of mind” move has worked to shift orders to healthier choices, Julia Braun, head of global nutrition at McDonald's Corp., said in a phone interview Monday with Nation’s Restaurant News.

In the U.S., the pivot was even greater. Consumers ordering milk, water or juice increased from 37% in 2013 to 52% in 2018, the report stated. That has translated to McDonald’s domestic restaurants serving more than 3.4 billion fruit, low-fat dairy and water items in Happy Meals since 2013.

“We’ve seen a significant shift in customer ordering patterns,” Braun said.

Other milestones include: McDonald’s has served more than 6.4 billion fruit, vegetable, low-fat dairy and water items in Happy Meals since September 2013 in the 20 global markets.

“We’re making real progress offering and promoting balanced choices in Happy Meals around the world,” Braun said in a statement. “This work measures and demonstrates the positive impact we’re having as we build a better McDonald’s and use our scale as a force for good.”

Specifically, the variety of choices includes 161 types of fruits, vegetables, low fat dairy and water options. Choices vary and are unique to what’s available various global markets. For example, grape tomatoes are offered in Australia, corn cups in Taiwan, and heart-shaped carrots in Austria.

The global markets include the United States, Canada, Brazil, Argentina, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Austria, Spain, Netherlands, Italy, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland, Russia, Hong Kong, China, Japan, Taiwan and Australia.

Kathy Higgins, CEO for the Alliance for a Healthier Generation, said working with McDonald’s to change “the systems and environments that impact the health of children” is transformational and can have a positive influence on other companies with similar scale.

McDonald’s has about 38,000 locations in more than 100 countries around the world. In the U.S., the Chicago-based chain has about 14,000 units.

"Texas high school opens grocery store for students, families — and it accepts good deeds as payment","Texas high school opens grocery store for students, families — and it accepts good deeds as payment",1.0,"article

A high school in Texas has opened a student-run grocery store, providing food and other necessities to students, staff and their families in need amid the coronavirus pandemic — while providing kids with essential job skills.

The grocery store at Linda Tutt High School doesn’t accept cash. It operates on a point system, where students can earn points for positive office referrals, cleaning around the school building and other good deeds.

“It’s not something that you see every day in a school building,” said school principal Anthony Love. “I think a big part of it is about empowering our students, because many of them come from low socioeconomic families that need just a little extra support with food.”

The store is the result of combined efforts from the local nonprofit First Refuge Ministries, Albertsons grocery store, and Texas Health Resources. Love said he was approached by Paul Juarez, executive director of First Refuge Ministries, and Dr. Ann Hughes, the director of student intervention for Sanger Independent School District.

“They approached me about a grant that they wanted to apply for through Texas Health Resources, about possibly putting a grocery store inside a school,” Love explained.

The store, which aims to address food insecurities for students and others in the community during the ongoing pandemic, is open Monday through Wednesday for students and staff within the school district.

On Tuesday evenings, the public can utilize the grocery store via curbside pickup with the help of volunteers. The amount of family members in the household determines the amount of points they receive to shop the store, which individuals can then use to get groceries or supplies for home.

The school also partners on Fridays with the BackPack Program, a program in cities across the country providing food for children on the weekends. “Partnering with them, we’re able to provide additional food and supplies that the families may need,” Love explained.

Students entirely run the store, doing everything from keeping shelves stocked, to keeping tracking of inventory to managing the point system.

“I think the most exciting part of it is just teaching our kids job skills that they can carry with them as they graduate high school and move on into the world,” Love added. “Students are really the key piece to it.”

This is Love’s second year as principal at the school, located about 60 miles northwest of Dallas. The school gives students the option of either in-person or virtual instruction this year due to the pandemic, though Love estimated that roughly 90% are currently in-person.

Walmart cashier steps in when nail salon refuses wheelchair-bound woman,Walmart cashier steps in when nail salon refuses wheelchair-bound woman,1.0,"(8/3/2018) - A simple act of kindness is making a big impact.

When a Walmart cashier in Burton saw a customer get turned away from the store's nail salon, she took matters into her own hands

""I was like making sandwiches and I was watching her like,"" Tasia Smith said of the scene Thursday that brought her to tears.

She works at the Subway inside the Burton Walmart on Court Street.

That's where she captured a photo, which has since gone viral, of Walmart cashier Ebony Harris skipping her break to paint customer Angela Peters' nails.

""I just wanted to post it for awareness and appreciation, because people needed to know what was going on with the business and Ebony deserved all the appreciation she could get,"" Tasia said.

Harris said she watched the nail salon, located just a few feet over, refuse to do Peters' nails because her hands shake quite a bit due to cerebral palsy. So, she decided to do something about it.

""I just wanted to make her day special. I didn't really want her day to be ruined. That's why I did it. And plus she's a sweetie,"" Harris said.

Together, the two picked out some polish and relaxed in the seating area at Subway for a manicure.

""And you know, she moved her hands a little bit and she kept saying she was sorry. And, I told her don't say that. I said you're fine,"" Harris said.

It was a simple act of patience and kindness that's still making Angela smile.

""I thought that was so nice of her and I already felt comfortable with her because, like I said, I shop at Walmart a lot,"" Peters said.

Harris has no qualms with the nail salon, but she hopes her actions inspire others to treat people with disabilities the way they would want to be treated themselves.

""We're not trying to bash the nail salon. We're not trying to make them lose customers, make them look bad,"" she said. ""But maybe spread awareness that no matter the person, who they are, what color they are, disability, whatever, they're people too. She's a girly girl. She's just like you, me, Tasia, my daughter, anybody. She wants to look pretty, you know, and so why can't she?""

Sitting next to her new friend at her store inside Collette's Vintage and Antique Mall, Peters said she's grateful not only for Harris' help, but a beautiful manicure too.

""I'm like wow. These are amazing!"" she said.

""I told her she's a blessing to us, to anybody, not just me. She makes me look at life and appreciate it much more than, you know, what I have been,"" Harris added.

The three plan to continue their friendship, already scheduling a dinner at Peters' favorite restaurant in town.

To check out Angela's business, stop by Collette's Vintage and Antique Mall on Wednesday through Friday or the Davison Farmer's Market on Saturdays.

Soldier Whose House Was Looted Gives Away Money Raised for Him: 'I Wanted to Show Kindness',A soldier whose house was looted during Hurricane Florence gave away the money raised for him instead.,1.0,"Luis Ocampo and Kailey Finch were overwhelmed by the donations they received after their home was looted last month — so, they gave some of the money away

Soldier Whose House Was Looted Gives Away Money Raised for Him: 'I Wanted to Show Kindness'

Army medic Luis Ocampo returned from the front lines of Hurricane Florence in September to find his house looted, and some of his family’s most cherished possessions stolen. Now, after generous well-wishers donated money to replace his losses, Ocampo is giving away most of the money that was raised for him.

“We got more than we expected, and felt that it was our responsibility to show someone that same kindness that so many showed us,” Ocampo, 24, tells PEOPLE.

Get push notifications with news, features and more.

Ocampo left his home in Charlotte last month when his unit from the North Carolina National Guard was called to help with hurricane relief. Ocampo spent days in New Bern, a riverfront city ravaged by the storm.

With Ocampo gone, his girlfriend Kailey Finch and their infant son also left home.

“I went to Luis’ parents, because I felt safer there,” says Finch, 20. She left the family dog inside the house.

On September 21, Ocampo returned home to find the back door open, and their dog running loose in the yard.

“Someone came in through our son’s bedroom window,” Finch says. “They busted the locks with a shovel, and propped open the window. The house was trashed.”

Clothes and other belongings were flung around the house. Whoever looted the house stole mostly electronics, including a laptop that Ocampo used for school work, and game systems. Other items stolen include a gun, jewelry, two jars full of change, and a box of coins Ocampo’s grandmother had collected from around the world.

The looters even took food from the refrigerator.

The young couple posted about the break-in on Facebook, asking if anyone had information. A friend of the couple, Mary Elise Capron, saw the post and started a fundraiser.

“I have worked closely with Ocampo in the National Guard and he is an amazing soldier and person,” Capron wrote on the GoFundMe page set up for Finch and Ocampo. “I am honored to know him and cannot believe something so terrible could happen to someone so dedicated to the service, his family and school.”

In just 11 days, the fundraiser reached nearly $15,000 — surpassing Capron’s $5,000 goal. Ocampo and Finch said they were astonished to receive so much.

“It was overwhelming,” Finch tells PEOPLE. “It was way more than we needed.”

So, the couple asked Capron to shut down donations, with Finch noting that she and Ocampo didn’t “want to abuse people’s generosity.”

Still, benefactors wanted to keep giving. So Ocampo and Finch decided to pay the generosity forward, and began redirecting the additional donations.

“Other people really need help that they can’t get,” Finch says.

Ocampo and Finch are sending money to the Soldiers and Airmen Assistance Fund. The couple is also giving some of the money to a soldier who began living in a hotel after a tree fell on his house during the hurricane.",https://people.com/human-interest/luis-ocampo-house-looted-florence-pay-forward/

"The Fire Hub restaurant, a casino spinoff, feeds its customers and funds food pantry","Casino starts a restaurant and uses the proceeds to fund an onsite food bank serving 400 families per month, donates additional earnings to local nonprofits",1.0,"Visitors are greeted with clearly marked directions in the building that is both a restaurant and a food pantry.

A restaurant and food pantry is a unique combination.

As a chef and Vice President of Food and Beverage at FireKeepers Casino Hotel, Michael McFarlen was in a unique position to see the amount of food thrown away on a daily basis.And McFarlen's involvement with the South Central Food Bank of Michigan Inc., where he serves as president of the board, gave him a similarly unique view of the number of people in the community who face food insecurity.Ongoing food waste juxtaposed with a landscape populated with people, many of whom who don’t know where their next meal is coming from, prompted McFarlen and FireKeepers leadership to develop a plan. They decided to renovate an old fire station to accommodate the Fire Hub Restaurant and Kendall Street Food Pantry which share space at Dickman Road and Kendall Street.The restaurant occupies the front of the building and the food pantry is at the back.While community service and outreach are not unique to casinos owned by Native American tribes, combining a restaurant and food pantry is, says Kathy George, Chief Executive Officer of FireKeepers.“It really is unique,” George says. “A number of casinos do outreach, but we’re not aware of anyone who actually created a restaurant and food pantry directly.”Guest feedback about the food and service at the Fire Hub has been overwhelmingly positive. It has earned 4.5 out of 5-star reviews on TripAdvisor with “excellent” and “very good” ratings. While George says the first year of operation was successful, she acknowledges that revenues were not quite what they were expected to be.“Anytime you open a new restaurant, you just have to figure a way through that first year,” George says.However, the Fire Hub and the food pantry exceeded initial expectations for much different reasons – the restaurant for its popularity and sustainability and the food pantry for the numbers of people it has been serving since its doors first opened.McFarlen says projected numbers were between 65 and 70 households when the pantry began operating. That number quickly escalated to 100 on each distribution day – every Monday from 4-6 p.m. – which equates to between 375 to 400 households per month.The money to operate the Fire Hub is a combination of $140,000 that comes from the tribe annually and from food and beverage revenue generated by the restaurant.Proceeds from the Fire Hub have been given to nonprofits, including Safe Place and the Food Bank of South Central Michigan Inc. which recently received a check for $15,000. McFarlen says he’d like to be in a position to make even larger donations to area charities on a more frequent basis.“We’re building a fiscally responsible business that takes profits and gives to nonprofits,” he says. “As we get more and more involved, we will give to many other charities and nonprofits.”Robert Elchert, Community Impact Associate for United Way of the Battle Creek and Kalamazoo Region, says the Fire Hub is a great United Way partner because they apply their strengths and energy in specific ways to impact the community. He cites the Fire Hub’s hosting of United Way Pop Up Giving events and VolunBeer activities for their young leaders group as examples of this partnership.“They support our work addressing food insecurity through the Kendall Street Food Pantry, in concert with the Food Bank of South Central Michigan. Partnerships like this deliver a vital return on community and social responsibility,” Elchert says. “From United Way's perspective, Fire Hub models the kind of collaboration that can address the toughest needs vulnerable individuals and families are facing.”Food pantry clients are limited to one visit per month. They are registered with the program, which gives food pantry volunteers the ability to track their shopping habits and the number of people in their families, in addition to notifying them about special distributions.About 45 percent of people who come through only come through once, McFarlen says.“We have people who need that one-time distribution to get back on track,” he says. “About 20 percent are people who make two or three visits. They’re not all from Battle Creek. Some of them work here, but live in Albion, Marshall, and Kalamazoo.”Even though these people are employed, they continue to struggle, says Heather Mauney, director of Agency Relations for the Food Bank. In addition, she says, there is also a small number of people on a fixed income who are likely to always need their services and the services of others.“We’ve seen a significant increase in households where one or both adults are working and they find themselves in some sort of crisis situation like an illness or car accident and they need our help,” Mauney says. “We get a lot of people who are not used to how the system works. We’re able to cater to people who are working, but still need a little help during the month,” she says. “The need has not decreased. If anything it has increased and shifted.”The Kendall Street Food Pantry is the only one operated by the Food Bank of South Central Michigan which partners with more than 300 agencies in a service area that includes Barry, Branch, Calhoun, Hillsdale, Jackson, Kalamazoo, Lenawee, and St. Joseph counties. Heather Mauney, director of Agency Relations for the Food Bank, says it’s not common for food banks to operate food pantries.“We cover a 5,000-square-mile service area and the logistics of overseeing and running a pantry 100 miles away in Lenawee doesn’t make sense,” Mauney says. “The opportunity presented itself with FireKeepers and we just really didn’t have a good reason to say no. It makes sense for us to operate it because it gives us an opportunity to try out and test new things before rolling them out.“It is quite small compared to other pantries. Sometimes space can be a barrier for people who want to start a food pantry and we are able to show off how much we can do in a smaller space.”From the outset, the food pantry was designed to be a “choice pantry” which allows individuals to come in and “shop” for whatever they want. Milk and meat are among the staples people ask for on a regular basis, so the shelves are fairly well-stocked with these items. In addition, there are canned goods, boxed meals, fruits and vegetables and a small selection of gluten-free and vegan items.The pantry has the look and feel of a store with shelves that contain neatly arranged food products and shopping carts. “We wanted to take away the stigma and make it more like they’re going into a bodega or little store,” McFarlen says.Mauney says across the industry more work has been done with to address the stigma of individuals needing food pantries. Her food bank is working with agencies across its service areas to make sure that those who come into a food pantry are treated with kindness.Food to stock the Kendall Street Pantry shelves comes from a number of sources, including the United States Department of Agriculture; the Kellogg and Post companies; several large retail donors and stores; individual donors; and FireKeepers.Remember that food that McFarlen says remains unused or untouched at the Casino and Hotel? Well, that food is packaged up and taken to the food bank which then distributes to its partner agencies.“We purchased the equipment that is necessary to receive the proper licenses to flash-freeze food from the buffet and we make family trays out of them,” George says. “In addition to canned goods and fresh fruits and vegetables, we supplement them with family portions from the buffet.”Last year, more than 14,000 pounds of frozen food from FireKeepers made its way into area food pantries through the Casino/Hotel’s participation in the Environmental Protection Agency’s Food Recovery Challenge. As part of the challenge, organizations pledge to improve their sustainable food management practices and report their results. The Food Recovery Challenge is part of EPA's Sustainable Materials Management Program, which seeks to reduce the environmental impact of materials through their entire life cycle.“We drop off about half a ton of food each month and the food bank decides where it goes,” McFarlen says. “The FRC gives you an idea of where you stand with other people trying to make an impact. For a small community that we’re in to make this kind of impact I could only imagine what they do in Los Angeles and New York.”The prepared meals can be microwaved or boiled. But, McFarlen and his team also work with food pantry clients to show them how to prepare and cook fresh food, including vegetables that are donated by area farmers. This initiative came about after they learned that a lot of highly-nutrient, plant-based foods were being thrown out, particularly vegetables like rutabagas and kale.“We identified a shortcoming where families in need were getting the food but didn’t know how to prepare or create a recipe that their family would eat,” he says.The food bank and representatives with Michigan State University Extension Services partnered with McFarlen and his team to create recipes designed around what was being distributed. He says about 50 of these demonstrations happen each month throughout the Food Bank’s eight-county service area.Another component of FireKeepers efforts to address food insecurity involves a greenhouse program with the goal of establishing free salad bars at area schools. A variety of lettuces, cucumbers, tomatoes, micro-greens, and other salad staples are being grown organically (without pesticides) at a greenhouse on land owned by the tribe under the watchful eye of an agricultural specialist and employees with the Casino/Hotel’s Groundskeepers crew.“We looked at Battle Creek community schools and identified those schools with the highest number of students receiving free- or reduced-lunch. We looked at how we could tackle lunch programs and decided to put together a greenhouse program where we could put free salad bars into those schools,” McFarlen says.The first harvest is expected to happen in about one week. On April 1, the first salad bar will open at Athens Schools.Once the Community Garden is fully operational, McFarlen says he will rely on volunteers to augment the work required to make it sustainable. He anticipates getting support from casino employees, his team members, and individuals from the Food Bank.McFarlen says the majority of the day-to-day work and execution of the plans to broaden the scope and reach of FireKeepers work to address food insecurity in the community is done by his team. “They have done an amazing job,” he says.FireKeepers CEO George says it’s always been a priority of the tribe and FireKeepers to be good stewards of the community.“The Casino and band are phenomenal people,” she says. “They have such a huge heart and want to continue to be great partners in the community.”",http://www.secondwavemedia.com/southwest-michigan/features/The-Fire-Hub-restaurant-a-casino-spinoff-feeds-customers-and-food-pantry-patrons0123.aspx

From concentration camp survivor to national property award: Mark Dunajtschik honoured,This concentration camp survivor living in New Zealand is casually building a $50 million children's hospital and donating it to Wellington City.,1.0,"An interview, by Frances Cook, with property developer and philanthropist Mark Dunajtschik, who is building and donating $50m children's hospital in Wellington.

An interview, by Frances Cook, with property developer and philanthropist Mark Dunajtschik, who is building and donating $50m children's hospital in Wellington.

A prison camp survivor and late-blooming property magnate has been honoured by the Property Council, which has awarded him a members' laureate for significant contributions to the industry.

Wellington developer Mark Dunajtschik's lifetime achievements were honoured by the council tonight.

Leonie Freeman, council chief executive, said the humble man who came to New Zealand as a toolmaker in 1958 was a truly deserving recipient of the award because he was a property entrepreneur and philanthropist.

Dunajtschik had suffered an extraordinary plight when he was imprisoned by Yugoslav forces in a concentration camp in Knicanin before eventually escaping with his mother to Germany, a statement said.

There he trained as a toolmaker, before spending five years travelling the world and deciding to make New Zealand his home.

Soon after arriving in this country, he established Precision Grinders, running the business for 25 years.

But then his career took a swerve into property.

The Herald has reported how Dunajtschik was among this country's most successful property developers and investors, although he only started in the industry as a ""hobby"" at the age of 57 and has no staff.

Former Health Minister Jonathan Coleman described Dunajtschik's commitment as ""extraordinary"" and ""unparalleled"".

The entrepreneur's financial help enabled Wellington helicopter pilot the late Peter Button to set up an air rescue service, now called the Life Flight Trust, which has been credited with saving 22,000 lives.

In July, the Herald reported on progress since Dunajtschik announced his mammoth donation of $50 million to build and donate a purpose-built children's hospital for people in the greater Wellington area.

The Property Council tonight said his legacy included Wellington's Environment House, the James Smith Building, Harcourts Building, HSBC Tower, Asteron Centre and more recently the Children's Hospital for Capital & Coast District Health Board.

""I have always said that those people that are born with a healthy body and mind can look after themselves and those unfortunate to be born with, or suffering ill health, need our help,"" Dunajtschik said when he announced his $50m gift.

The Property Council said: ""Mark and his partner Dorothy have built an enduring legacy of Wellington commercial properties throughout his career.""

When he retired as a toolmaker in 1987, Dunajtschik took up property investment and development as a hobby, ""quickly accumulating and adding value to commercial and residential property around central Wellington, developing his unique, hands-on formula for success"", the council said.

It said he was known for ""getting involved personally in everything from electrical, plumbing and carpentry work, to ensuring lifts and doors are working

and negotiating with tenants and agents.

""He is among New Zealand's most successful property developers and investors, although he only started in the industry as a hobby at the age of 57,"" it noted.

"Mom learns foster baby is her adopted son's sister, so she adopts her as well","Mom learns foster baby is her adopted son's sister, so she adopts her as well",1.0,"Mom learns foster baby is her adopted son's sister, so she adopts her as well originally appeared on goodmorningamerica.com

A single mother received the surprise of her life after discovering that the baby girl she was about to adopt shared the same biological mother as her newly adopted son.

""[Hannah] is the opposite of Grayson,"" Katie Page of Parker, Colorado, told ""Good Morning America"" of her kids. ""He loves to chill and she's a wild thing. As soon as I started figuring it out that she was his sibling, I said, 'Absolutely, [I'll adopt her].' Once I took in Grayson and I accepted being his mom, I accepted his family.""

Page divorced in her early 30s before becoming a foster parent in 2016. During her marriage, she experienced issues with infertility but had dreams of being a mom, she said.

""It was on my bucket list and I also always wanted to adopt,"" Page added.

Page cared for four foster children before meeting Grayson — a baby boy who was abandoned at the hospital. On May 25, 2017, Page officially adopted Grayson, who is now 2 years old.

""The minute I saw him in the hospital, I fell in love,"" Page said. ""He's so calm and sweet. He has the biggest challenges of all the kids.""

A month after Page adopted Grayson, she received a call about a newborn girl, named Hannah, who needed a home.

Page said as soon as she met Hannah, now a year old, that she knew she wanted to give her a forever home as well.

But when Page brought Hannah home and saw the name of the biological mother on the hospital bracelet, she noticed a similarity.

""[The caseworkers] told me her story, which was really similar to Grayson's,"" Page recalled. ""I saw her medical bracelet and the first name of her mother was the same name as Grayson's mom. She didn't have a typical name.""

Page said it was unclear whether or not Grayson and Hannah were brother and sister because their mother had lied about her last name and date of birth when she left Grayson at the hospital on the day he was born. Both children had been exposed to methamphetamines in the womb, according to Page.

Page's roommate, Ashley Chapa, was present as she began unfolding the mystery.

""It was as surreal as you could imagine,"" Chapa told ""GMA."" ""Katie got her binder out from her paperwork with Grayson and we realized, same first name — everything. I've always thought she was a superwoman, but I think she is more now.""

On Dec. 28, 2018, Page officially adopted Hannah. Months prior, Page had a DNA test done on the children that confirmed them to be biological siblings, she said.

Page hopes to adopt Grayson and Hannah's 5-month-old sibling this year, she said.

2-Year-Old Girl Who Disappeared On Family Camping Trip Up North Found Safe,2-Year-Old Girl Missing For More Than 24 Hours On Family Camping Trip Found Safe,1.0,"COMINS TOWNSHIP, Mich. (WWJ) - A 2-year-old Monroe County girl who vanished while camping in northern Michigan has been found after a day-long search.

The search for Gabriella Vitale began around 8:15 a.m. Monday after she was reported missing from a campsite on Reber Road, just west of M-33 in Comins Township. The family had been camping and was preparing to leave when they realized Gabriella was missing.

""The roadway that this camp site is on is a very rural dirt road. The campsite is just a clearing in the woods -- this isn't, if you're picturing a commercial campsite with lots of campers and tents, that's not the case. This is just a clearing in the woods where this particular family was camping with just family members,"" Michigan State Police Lt. Travis House told WWJ's Beth Fisher. ""They lost track of her, sounds like for a relatively thorough period of time, and by the time they started to look for her, she was beyond their sight.""

A search effort went on through the night and just before noon Tuesday, Michigan State Police tweeted that Gabriella was found alive. Further details of her recovery weren't immediately released, but reports indicate Gabriella walked up to a home about a half-mile away from the campsite and a woman there called police.

What a trooper! The searchers are all clearing and the command center is packing up. pic.twitter.com/cUnUGN6dza — @MSPNorthernMI (@mspnorthernmi) July 16, 2019

Police believe Gabriella simply wandered away from the campsite, about 40 miles east of Grayling in Oscoda County. Foul play was never suspected.

""Gabriella may have autism or be on the spectrum, which is a concern because it can change and in a lot of ways make more difficult the search process,"" House said.

More than 50 officials and volunteers were involved in the search effort, which focused on a square-mile near the campsite.

""Most of it is densely forested, including some low land and swamps,"" said House.

Gabriella has been reunited with her family and taken to the hospital for evaluation.

Chicago teen secures COVID-19 vaccine appointments for hundreds of seniors,Chicago teen secures COVID-19 vaccine appointments for hundreds of seniors,1.0,"A tech-savvy Chicago high schooler -- who discovered that he had a knack for securing vaccine appointments -- is now helping hundreds of seniors do just that.

Benjamin Kagan is a freshman at Francis W. Parker School in Chicago. When he's not in school or doing homework, he spends a hefty majority of his time ""hunting for appointments"" for upward of 550 people in the Illinois area alongside a slate of volunteers known as the Chicago Vaccine Angels.

OHIO UNIVERSITIES’ TIPPING RIVALRY SPREADS TO FLORIDA WITH $2,800 LEFT FOR RESTAURANT’S STAFF

More than 74% of the Illinois residents that have requested help are over the age of 65, Kagan told Fox News.

""A lot of these people [seniors] are struggling a lot with the technological aspect of this whole thing, and they really need help,"" he said.

So he devised one centralized system to help track and book appointments for those in need.

It all started over winter break when he had helped his grandparents navigate Florida's system.

""The Florida system was a big mess,"" he said. ""It was this crazy thing and there were thousands and thousands of people vying for slots.""

With four computer monitors open, Kagan was up for the challenge. He recalled competing with about 66,000 other people.

After successfully securing his grandparents their first dose, he started helping his parents who own an essential business in Illinois.

After discovering the Facebook group, Chicago Vaccine Hunters, he began offering tips on how and where to look for vaccine appointments in the area.

And he wasn't the only one. In fact, he was one of many other users who were constantly offering guidance on the page.

Soon after he started posting tips, Kagan said his own Facebook inbox quickly became flooded with messages.

""That eventually morphed into people sending me private messages on Facebook saying, 'you know, Benjamin, can you help me? ... If I give you my info, can you use it for me?'"" he said.

The messages were too much for him to keep track of, so he formed the Chicago Vaccine Angels.

In order to create one centralized system, Kagan created a Google form that will feed a person's name and other personal information into a spreadsheet.

""Now, we're all hunting for appointments,"" he said.

In just over a week since the Google form went live, Kagan and his band of volunteers have already connected 294 people with appointments. However, the requests keep piling in.

To date, the spreadsheet has well over 554 responses.

Tracking down these appointments is no easy task, he said. While he was on winter break, he recalled spending hours each day just to manage all the requests.

And he has no plans to stop anytime soon.

Michael Kors Commits to Going Fur-Free in 2018,Michael Kors Commits to Going Fur-Free in 2018,1.0,"LONDON, United Kingdom — Michael Kors is going fur-free. The American accessible luxury brand announced Friday that it will no longer use animal fur in its products, with production being phased out by the end of December 2018. The policy will apply companywide, including the Jimmy Choo brand, which Kors acquired in July.

The house, which has paraded models down the runway wearing luxurious fur coats in the past, joins a growing number of fashion companies looking at alternatives after coming under pressure from animal rights activists and changing consumer tastes.

“This decision marks a new chapter as our company continues to evolve its use of innovative materials,” said John D. Idol, Michael Kors’ chairman and chief executive, in a statement.

“Due to technological advances in fabrications, we now have the ability to create a luxe aesthetic using non-animal fur,” added designer Michael Kors. “We will showcase these new techniques in our upcoming runway show in February.”

Michael Kors’ move follows a similar initiative by Gucci, which in October pledged to drop fur from its collections, joining brands like Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger and Armani, which are all fur-free. Retailers including Selfridges and Yoox-Net-a-Porter also do not sell fur items.

Yet despite a number of brands announcing fur-free policies, the use of the material in collections still prevails, said Fur Information Council of America spokesperson Keith Kaplan: ""Nearly 70 percent of major designers included fur in their Autumn/Winter 2017 collections.""

“In the pre-Fall 2018 showings currently underway, fur continues to maintain a major presence, because innovative new techniques in fur processing and production allow designers a breadth of creative possibilities unmatched by any other textile,” said Kaplan. “Designers and consumers also recognise the value of fur as a natural and sustainable product, as well as the artisanal craft skills that make each fur piece unique, [which is] especially important as consumers become more aware of the environmental and social costs of mass-produced fast fashion.""

“Killing animals for fur is archaic and inhumane,” said Wayne Pacelle, president and chief executive of the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS).

PJ Smith, the HSUS’s senior manager of fashion policy, who worked with the company on its fur-free policy, added: “Today’s consumers want fashionable, luxurious clothing and accessories that also align with their social values and Michael Kors’ fur-free move makes it a leader in that regard.”

The announcement comes after animal rights activists interrupted Kors' speech in June 2017, in a packed theatre at New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art. Over 20 protestors took the stage and balcony, while chanting and playing the sounds of animals being killed for fur, shutting down the event for approximately ten minutes.

Protestors have also been targeting fashion brands at London Fashion Week over the industry’s continued use of fur in its collections.

Utah Husband Who Walked Miles with a 'Need Kidney 4 Wife' Sign Finds a Donor,Husband walks miles with sign to find a kidney donor for wife withe stage 5 kidney failure,1.0,"The 74-year-old man who walked miles to find his ill wife a kidney finally got his wish

The 74-year-old man who walked miles every day in a bad to find his wife a kidney finally got his wish.

Wayne Winters, of Farr West, Utah, was desperate to find a kidney for his wife of 26 years, Deanne Winters, who has stage 5 kidney failure.

Get push notifications with news, features and more.

On Sunday, Winters told KSTU that he got the call they were both waiting for after two years – there was a kidney available.

“I was just so overwhelmed,” he said of the call he received from the hospital. “I didn’t know what to think.”

Finding a donor is no small feat — there are 3,000 new patients added to the kidney donor waiting list each month, and 13 people die every day while waiting for their chance, according to the National Kidney Foundation. It’s hard to know how long someone will remain on the waiting list, but waits of three years or more are not uncommon.

Winters walked miles every day by the side of busy roads wearing a sign asking for anyone to donate a kidney to his wife for weeks. After his story went viral, hundreds contacted him.

“Between seven to 800 [calls], it filled my phone up,” he said. “I’m sitting here with this full phone.”

Despite all the offers, his wife’s kidney actually came from an organ donor who had passed away. The new kidney will give the couple more time together and new memories to add to their two decades together.

“If she can gave a good five years that would be awesome, we can have our life back,” Winters said.

Now that his wife has been given a second chance, Winters plans to continue his daily walks with his sign to help others have the same chance.

“I will spend more of my days walking with my sign to see how many I can get,” he said. “Think about it, we could start a kidney revolution and that would be so great.”",http://people.com/human-interest/husband-who-walked-miles-for-wife-finds-donor/

Japan’s 10-Year Cancer Survival Rate Rises to 58.3%,Japan’s 10-Year Cancer Survival Rate Rises to 58.3%,1.0,"Japan Data

The 10-year survival rate for cancer, once regarded as an incurable disease, has steadily been improving in Japan and if the cancer can be detected early enough, this survival rate increases further.

The National Cancer Center Japan has announced that the 10-year survival rate for patients diagnosed with cancer between 2004 and 2007 was 58.3%. A study was conducted using the statistics of 94,000 cancer patients aged between 15 and 94 at 21 cancer medical facilities, where they had been diagnosed. Cases of death other than cancer were not included in the calculation of survival rates. This figure is a 1.1 percentage point increase compared to the survival rate during the previous study, based on cancer patients diagnosed from 2003 to 2006. This is the sixth time the National Cancer Center has announced the 10-year survival rate and it continues to improve due to advances in treatment, such as new medicine development.

A closer look at the 10-year survival rates by cancer type shows that prostate cancer had the highest rate with 98.8% and those for breast, thyroid, and uterine cancers were all above 80%. Those with a survival rate of less than 20% were gallbladder and bile duct with 19.1%, liver with 16.1%, and pancreatic with 6.2%.

Meanwhile, the 5-year survival rate, based on a study of 148,000 patients diagnosed with cancer between 2010 and 2012 at 32 facilities nationwide, stood at 68.6%. This was a 0.2-point rise from the previous study based on diagnoses given between 2009 and 2011. The survival rate for prostate cancer was 100% and for breast cancer it was 93.6%.

The 10-year survival rates by the stage at which the cancer was detected (stage 1 being the earliest of four) clearly show the importance of early detection and treatment. For stomach cancer, the 10-year survival rate at stage 4 is only 5.9%, but if detected at stage 1, the rate rises to 90.8%.

"Enamel regeneration breakthrough could end tooth decay agony, scientists say","Enamel regeneration breakthrough could end tooth decay agony, scientists say - Researchers say they can trigger the growth of crystals in an ""exciting"" breakthrough that could help protect people's teeth.",1.0,"Scientists claim they have developed a material that could help regenerate tooth enamel to prevent decay and sensitivity.

Enamel, the outer coating of the teeth, is the hardest tissue in the body and can resist extreme temperatures and acidic food and drinks.

But unlike other tissues it cannot regrow, leading to pain and tooth loss for roughly 50% of the world's population.

Researchers at Queen Mary University of London say they have developed a way to grow mineralised material, paving the way for regenerating hard tissues such as enamel and bone.

The team found a protein that is able to trigger the growth of crystals, in a similar way to how crystals grow when dental enamel develops in the body.

The experts believe their work, published in science journal Nature Communications, has the potential to be used in a variety of ways in regenerative medicine.

Image: Researchers believe their breakthrough could help treat hypersensitivity

Dr Sherif Elsharkawy, a dentist and co-author of the study, said: ""This is exciting because the simplicity and versatility of the mineralisation platform opens up opportunities to treat and regenerate dental tissues.

""For example, we could develop acid-resistant bandages that can infiltrate, mineralise, and shield exposed dentinal tubules (microscopic channels) in human teeth for the treatment of hypersensitivity.""

Lead author Professor Alvaro Mata said the ""key discovery"" had been finding a way to exploit proteins to control and guide the process of mineralisation.

He added: ""Through this, we have developed a technique to easily grow synthetic materials that emulate such hierarchically organised architecture over large areas and with the capacity to tune their properties.""

The findings come months after it was reported that children and teenagers had almost 43,000 ""completely preventable"" NHS operations to remove rotting teeth in 2017.

Analysis of NHS spending data by the Local Government Association found that £36.2m was spent on 42,911 extractions for under-18s in 2016/17, which equates to 170 operations a day.",https://news.sky.com/story/scientists-claim-they-can-regenerate-tooth-enamel-to-prevent-decay-11392540

Tanaka marked her birthday with a party on Sunday along with staff and friends at the nursing home, television footage from local broadcaster TVQ Kyushu Broadcasting Co showed.

Tanaka, whose birthday was on Jan. 2, took a bite from a slice of her big birthday cake. “Tasty,” she said with a smile. “I want some more.”

Tanaka was last year confirmed as the oldest living person, aged 116 years 66 days old as of March 9, according to Guinness World Records.

Tanaka’s record age is symbolic of Japan’s fast-ageing population, which coupled with its falling birthrate is raising concerns about labor shortages and prospects for future economic growth.

The number of babies born in Japan fell an estimated 5.9% last year to fewer than 900,000 for the first time since the government started compiling data in 1899, according to Japan’s welfare ministry.

Scotland bans companies based in tax havens from accessing coronavirus bailout money,Scotland bans companies based in tax havens from accessing coronavirus bailout money,1.0,"Scotland has become the latest country to block companies based in tax havens from accessing coronavirus bailout funds, in a move that will increase pressure on Boris Johnson’s government to introduce similar measures.

MSPs approved new rules on Wednesday night that will mean companies that are registered in tax havens, or are a subsidiary of an offshore company, cannot apply for government grants.

France, Belgium, Denmark, Poland, Wales and Argentina have applied similar policies to their coronavirus business-support packages.

A second amendment to the Scottish legislation, introduced by the Green Party, would have required companies taking bailout money to commit to country-by-country reporting in their accounts. However, the amendment was voted down.

Country-by-country reporting has long been a central policy request of the tax justice movement because it would open up to public scrutiny any shifting of corporate profits into tax havens.

Campaigners welcomed the Scottish parliament’s move but warned that it would not prevent large firms that avoid billions in tax from accessing bailout funds.

Scotland, like other European countries that have introduced tax-haven clauses, is relying on the EU’s blacklist of tax havens that does not include some notable tax-avoidance hotspots, such as Jersey, the British Virgin Islands, Switzerland and the Netherlands.

The Tax Justice Network’s chief executive, Alex Cobham, said this would leave the door open to companies registered in many of the world’s most dangerous corporate tax havens.

He said: “The EU tax-haven blacklist, which Scotland and other European countries are relying on to stop Covid-19 bailouts from ending up in tax havens, is based on an old-fashioned notion of tax havens as small, palm-fringed islands and ignores the reality of modern-day tax havenry.

“Many of the biggest corporate tax havens are based right here in Europe.”

According to the Tax Justice Network’s research, Luxembourg is responsible for 11 times more corporate tax avoidance risk than the EU-blacklisted Seychelles.

The network estimates that Luxembourg costs EU members over $12bn (£9.8bn) in lost corporate tax per year.

“The coronavirus pandemic has exposed the grave costs of an international tax system programmed to prioritise the interest of corporate giants over the needs of people,” Mr Cobham said.

“For years, corporate tax havens like the Netherlands and Luxembourg have fuelled a race to the bottom, handing over wealth and power to the biggest corporations and taking it away from the nurses and public service workers risking their lives today to protect ours.”

Scotland’s measures, which were backed by the SNP and the Conservatives, cover a £120m fund that provides grants for small- and medium-sized firms, and a £30m bailout fund for creative, tourism and hospitality businesses.

Patrick Harvie, the Scottish Green Party co-leader, said: “Any company which avoids its responsibility to contribute to society should not be getting handouts when things go wrong. That’s why many European nations and Wales have already made this commitment.

“I’m delighted that ministers finally saw sense on this basic issue of fairness. This move isn’t the final word, but it marks the beginning of a new approach to tackling the companies which shamelessly avoid paying tax, and we will continue to build on what’s been achieved today.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/scotland-tax-have-ban-coronavirus-bailout-fund-a9526006.html

SALT LAKE CITY — Every day, people just want to get to work on time. The traffic. The noise. The rush.

Brian Smith would've given anything to have been part of it.

""In the blink of an eye, life can really take a turn on you quickly,"" said Smith.

Last February, he was let go from his job. Rent 30 days past due became 60, then 90, and eventually, he was homeless.

""Off and on, yes,” Smith said. “Staying in hotels, couches, cars — anything you can find.”

Almost a year and a 180 résumés later, and nothing.

""Rejection after rejection,"" Smith said.

A man can only take so much.

""These last 10 months, I've lost my faith in humanity, in God, in life,” Smith said. ""There were many times when shotguns looked very tempting.""

It was about as low as you can get, but Smith decided to at least make it to the new year. When he went on ksl.com to look for jobs, he saw a story KSL did on a Utah company giving suits to homeless people to help them feel confident during job interviews.

Utah Woolen Mills, a clothing store in Salt Lake City, is giving away hundreds of suits to those desperate for a job. For every suit the store sells this year, Utah Woolen Mills will donate a suit to a man committed to improving his life for the better, the company says on its website.

""The power of that first impression ... You can't put a price on confidence,"" said B.J. Stringham, president of Utah Woolen Mills.

Smith got the suit Saturday, interviewed Monday and got the job Tuesday.

""I didn't think it would happen to me, and it did, and I owe them so much,"" Smith said.

It's the first success story for this project.

""I hope he gets everything he wants in life,"" Stringham said.

This coming Monday, Smith just might be the only person smiling in the middle of the rush to get to work.

""I thank them from the bottom of my heart,"" he said.

TROY, Ohio — After finding out his teenage sister had been killed in a car accident over the weekend, Mark Ross said he wanted to be with his mother as soon as he could.

Without a vehicle, Ross said that he convinced someone he knew to drive, and jumped in the man’s car just after 3 a.m. Sunday in Indiana. Ross wrote in a Facebook post that they were speeding through Ohio, bound for Detroit, when the lights flashed behind them.

“I knew I was going to jail due to a petty warrant,” Ross wrote.

Ross was in the passenger seat of the car when Trooper J. Davis pulled them over, and the driver had a suspended license and an outstanding warrant as well, according to Inside Edition.

Trooper Davis ended up taking the driver into custody and having the car towed, which left Ross stranded in Ohio.

Ross explained what happened next when Ohio State Highway Patrol Sergeant David Robison arrived:

“I broke down crying and he saw the sincerity in my cry. He REACHES OVER AND BEGAN PRAYING OVER ME AND MY FAMILY. He offered to bring me 100 miles further to Detroit because they towed the vehicle. Everybody knows how much I dislike Cops but I am truly Greatful (sic) for this Guy. He gave me hope”

True to his word, Robison drove Ross more than 100 miles to a Detroit coffee shop where he could meet his cousin.

“It was just so overwhelming,” Ross told Inside Edition. “They were trying to help us.”

Ross and his family said they are so grateful for Robison’s generosity, and that the sergeant has even promised to attend the funeral.",http://kfor.com/2016/09/27/pulled-over-for-speeding-grieving-man-stunned-when-officer-drives-him-100-miles-to-be-with-family/

Plastic bag use down 90% in England since 5p levy,Plastic bag use down 90% in England since 5p levy,1.0,"Sales of plastic bags in England’s largest supermarkets have fallen by 90% in the four years since the government introduced a 5p levy

England’s seven largest supermarkets sold 490 million fewer single-use plastic bags in 2018/19 than the year before – a drop of almost half, the department for environment, food and rural affairs (DEFRA) has revealed.

In 2014, more than 7.5 billion bags were sold per year. Five years on, just 1.1 billion were sold.

The 5p charge on plastic bag sales have also contributed to £169m worth of charity donations, with more than £22m raised in 2018/19 alone, according to DEFRA.

Environment secretary Theresa Villiers said, “No one wants to see the devastating impact plastic waste is having on our precious wildlife. Today’s figures are a powerful demonstration that we are collectively calling time on being a throwaway society.”

If marine litter is not tackled, plastic in the sea will treble in a decade, government scientists have warned.

The government has also recently announced a range of measures to eliminate all forms of avoidable plastic waste, including a ban on microbeads. Plastic straws, stirrers and cotton buds will also be banned from April 2020.

The Scottish government has already committed to a deposit return scheme for drinks containers, and Westminster has recently consulted on the same.

If a consultation on the idea is approved, the UK government will also introduce a tax on any plastic packaging that is not made of at least 30% recycled content from April 2022.

New York to become 15th state to ban 'gay conversion therapy',New York to become 15th state to ban ‘gay conversion therapy’,1.0,"The New York State Legislature voted Tuesday to ban so-called gay conversion therapy on minors, with Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo expected to sign the bill as soon as this week. The measure, which passed 57-4 in the Senate and 134 to 3 in the Assembly, will make New York the 15th state to ban the controversial practice, which is widely discredited by medical and mental health organizations.

“New York has a compelling interest in protecting the physical and psychological well-being of minors, including lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youth,” the bill reads in part, “and in protecting its minors against exposure to serious harms caused by sexual orientation change efforts.”

#BREAKING: The New York State Senate just passed the Gender Expression Non-Discrimination Act, prohibiting discrimination based on gender identity or expression and adding protections for transgender NYers to the state’s Hate Crimes Law.



Recognition, at long last. #GENDA pic.twitter.com/Irmht2L4KW — Senator Brad Hoylman (@bradhoylman) January 15, 2019

The ban is part of a larger LGBTQ rights push announced by Cuomo last year, an agenda that includes prohibiting the so-called gay panic defense in court and adding gender identity to state human rights and hate crime laws. (The Gender Expression Non-Discrimination Act passed the Legislature today as well.)

Bans on conversion therapy — which seeks to change one’s sexual orientation or gender identity — repeatedly have passed the Democrat-controlled Assembly, only to die in the Republican-dominated Senate. But the GOP ceded its majority in the midterm election, paving the way for today’s victory.

Democrat Brad Hoylman, who authored the Senate bill, called conversion therapy “among the worst frauds in history.”

“We have to consider the message we are sending to LGBT youth today,” Hoylman said Monday after the bill passed committee. “That we have your back and you are perfect just the way you are.”“The State of New York has a responsibility to stop licensed mental health professionals from causing irreparable damage to LGBT youth and their families,” Hoylman said when advocating for the ban in 2014.

Mathew Shurka, a member of the anti-conversion therapy group Born Perfect, told NBC News he ""feel[s] safer” after the bill’s passage, but he stressed that the fight against the discredited practice is still “not over.”

“The next step is testing the law,” he said, “because there are several working conversion therapy practitioners in New York State.”

According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, conversion therapy “can provoke guilt and anxiety while having little or no potential for achieving changes in orientation.” Techniques used to attempt to change sexual orientation and gender identity have included inducing nausea and vomiting, providing electric shocks, psychotropic medication and hypnosis. And according to a 2009 report by the American Psychological Association, the treatment has been associated with depression, suicidal thoughts, substance abuse, high-risk sexual behaviors, homelessness and other issues.

The Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law recently estimated that 20,000 LGBTQ youth between the ages of 13 and 17 will undergo conversion therapy by a licensed health care professional before they turn 18, and approximately 57,000 will be subjected to the treatment by a religious leader or spiritual adviser. In 2012, California became the first state to prohibit conversion therapy on minors, and since then more than a dozen other states, the District of Columbia and several localities across the U.S. have followed suit. A number of state legislatures are currently considering bans, including Texas, Minnesota and Indiana.

The issue has also entered the multiplex, with two recent films recounting the struggles of young people subjected to conversion therapy: “The Miseducation of Cameron Post,” starring Chloë Grace Moretz, and “Boy Erased,” with Lucas Hedges, Nicole Kidman and Russell Crowe.

A deeply divided Supreme Court on Friday delivered a historic victory for gay rights, ruling 5 to 4 that the Constitution requires that same-sex couples be allowed to marry no matter where they live.

The court’s action rewarded years of legal work by same-sex marriage advocates and marked the culmination of an unprecedented upheaval in public opinion and the nation’s jurisprudence.

Marriages began Friday in states that had previously thwarted the efforts of same-sex couples to wed, while some states continued to resist what they said was a judicial order that changed the traditional definition of marriage and sent the country into uncharted territory. As of the court’s decision Friday morning, there were 14 states where same-sex couples were not allowed to marry.

Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who has written all of the court’s decisions recognizing and expanding gay rights, said the decision was based on the fundamental right to marry and the equality that must be afforded gay Americans.

“Under the Constitution, same-sex couples seek in marriage the same legal treatment as opposite-sex couples, and it would disparage their choices and diminish their personhood to deny them this right,” Kennedy wrote. He was joined in the ruling by the court’s liberal justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.

All four of the court’s most conservative members — Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. — dissented, and each wrote a separate opinion.

The common theme in their dissents was that judicial activism on the part of five members of the court had usurped a power that belongs to the people.

“If you are among the many Americans — of whatever sexual orientation — who favor expanding same-sex marriage, by all means celebrate today’s decision,” wrote Roberts, who for the first time in his tenure marked his disagreement with a decision by reading part of his dissent from the bench.

“Celebrate the achievement of a desired goal. Celebrate the opportunity for a new expression of commitment to a partner. Celebrate the availability of new benefits. But do not celebrate the Constitution. It had nothing to do with it,” he wrote.

Scalia called the decision a “threat to American democracy,” saying it robs citizens of “the freedom to govern themselves.”

In a statement in the White House Rose Garden, President Obama hailed the decision: “This ruling is a victory for America. This decision affirms what millions of Americans already believe in their hearts. When all Americans are truly treated as equal, we are more free.”

It wasn’t until 2012 that Obama declared that same-sex couples should be able to marry, and it was only last year that he said he thought the Constitution provided such a right. But by Friday evening, the rainbow colors that gay rights activists have adopted were projected onto the north face of the White House. With the Supreme Court’s ruling, Obama said, “Today we can say in no uncertain terms that we have made our union a little more perfect.”

There were wild scenes of celebrations on the sidewalk outside the Supreme Court. Same-sex marriage supporters had arrived early, armed with signs and rainbow flags. They cheered at the announcement of a constitutional right for gay marriage, which did not legally exist anywhere in the world until the turn of this century. The first legally recognized same-sex marriages in the United States took place just 11 years ago, the result of a Massachusetts state supreme court decision.

Jim Obergefell, who became the face of the case, Obergefell v. Hodges, when he sought to put his name on his husband’s Ohio death certificate as the surviving spouse, said, “Today’s ruling from the Supreme Court affirms what millions across the country already know to be true in our hearts: that our love is equal.”

“It is my hope that the term gay marriage will soon be a thing of the past, that from this day forward it will be, simply, marriage,” he said.

But Austin R. Nimocks, senior counsel for the Alliance Defending Freedom, a group that supports traditional marriage, said: “Today, five lawyers took away the voices of more than 300 million Americans to continue to debate the most important social institution in the history of the world. . . . Nobody has the right to say that a mom or a woman or a dad or a man is irrelevant. There are differences that should be celebrated.”

[Opponents of gay marriage are divided on whether to resist the ruling]

The Supreme Court used cases from Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee, where restrictions against same-sex marriage were upheld by an appeals court last year, to find that the Constitution does not allow such prohibitions.

Kennedy over the past 20 years has written the Supreme Court’s most important gay rights cases: overturning criminal laws on homosexual conduct, protecting gays from discrimination and declaring that the federal government could not refuse to recognize same-sex marriages performed where they were legal.

He often employs a lofty, ­writing-for-history tone, and Friday’s decision was no different.

Referring to the couples who brought the cases before the court, Kennedy wrote: “It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves. Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization’s oldest institutions.”

Kennedy did not respond directly to the court’s dissenters, but he addressed the argument that the court was creating a constitutional right. The right to marriage is fundamental, he said. The difference is society’s evolving view of gay people and their rights, he said.

“The limitation of marriage to opposite-sex couples may long have seemed natural and just, but its inconsistency with the central meaning of the fundamental right to marry is now manifest,” he wrote. “With that knowledge must come the recognition that laws excluding same-sex couples from the marriage right impose stigma and injury of the kind prohibited by our basic charter.”

As in previous decisions, Kennedy did not spell out how courts should scrutinize laws that treated gays differently. But Mary Bonauto, who argued the case for gay plaintiffs at the Supreme Court, said that message from Kennedy’s combined opinions “is one of inclusion: Stop making rules for gay people.”

Scalia was a sharp critic of Kennedy’s style, saying it was “as pretentious as its content is egotistic.”

“The Supreme Court of the United States has descended from the disciplined legal reasoning of John Marshall and Joseph Story to the mystical aphorisms of the fortune cookie,” Scalia wrote.

Roberts wrote a lengthy dissent that was a point-by-point takedown of the majority opinion. Gay activists had wondered whether the 60-year-old justice might take note of the increasing public support for same-sex marriage and find a way to join the majority on what they called the “right side of history.”

But he and the other dissenters said the question was not whether same-sex marriage was a good idea, but who should decide.

“The court invalidates the marriage laws of more than half the states and orders the transformation of a social institution that has formed the basis of human society for millennia, for the Kalahari Bushmen and the Han Chinese, the Carthaginians and the Aztecs,” Roberts wrote. “Just who do we think we are?”

Roberts rejected a comparison to Loving v. Virginia, in which the court struck down bans on interracial marriage. That did not change the age-old definition of marriage as between a man and a woman, he said. He raised concerns that the decision could lead to polygamous marriages — he mentioned a married threesome of lesbians called a “throuple.”

He noted that voters and legislators in only 11 states had authorized same-sex marriages, and said it was better for gay marriage to be adopted through the democratic process than by judicial order. He said religious leaders could take little comfort from the majority opinion that their beliefs would be respected.

That theme was picked up by Alito in his dissent. He said there could be “bitter and lasting wounds” from the decision and warned that the decision will be “exploited by those who are determined to stamp out every vestige of dissent.”

The questions raised in the cases decided Friday were left unanswered in 2013, when the justices last confronted the issue of same-sex marriage. A slim majority of the court said at the time that a key portion of the Defense of Marriage Act — withholding the federal government’s recognition of same-sex marriages — was unconstitutional. In a separate case that year, the court said procedural issues kept it from answering the constitutional question in a case from California but allowed same-sex marriages to resume in that state.

Since then, courts across the nation — with the notable exception of the Cincinnati-based federal appeals court that left intact the restrictions in the four states at issue — have struck down a string of state prohibitions on same-sex marriage, many of them passed by voters in referendums.

Jay-Z and Meek Mill sending 10 million surgical masks to U.S. jails and prisons,Jay-Z and Meek Mill sending 10 million surgical masks to U.S. jails and prisons,1.0,"With a $10 million boost from Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Jay-Z and Meek Mill's criminal justice organization REFORM Alliance is sending 10 million surgical masks and other personal protective equipment to correctional facilities across the country.

""This is 2.3 million Americans that don't usually have the loudest voice,"" Bob Pilon, president of the REFORM Alliance, told CBS News. ""That's why we're doing this, to give that population a voice and answer their call to be treated like humans.""

Dorsey's donation was made through his Smart Small relief fund. He's pledged $1 billion to COVID-19 relief efforts. The charity is based on a transparent tracker of public grants, which Dorsey said will shift focus after the pandemic.

""I'm grateful REFORM exists. The criminal justice system needs to change. COVID-19 adds to the injustices, and REFORM is best suited to help,"" Dorsey said in a statement.

REFORM intends to create a similar system to track the equipment. A small team will manage the program's accountability from start to finish, Pilon said.

The donation coincides with the REFORM's new #AnswerTheirCall digital campaign, an effort to highlight mass incarceration through the accounts of inmates.

The Prison Policy Initiative estimates roughly one-third of U.S. jails have cut their populations by 25% since the pandemic began. In the nation's epicenter of the crisis, New York City's jail population now hovers below 4,000, its lowest level in decades.

A recent report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed the difficulties prisons and jails are facing when combating the disease, including the critical need for broad-based testing of both inmates and staff.

Correctional facilities with widespread testing show the highest number of positive cases, suggesting the true number of overall cases behind bars is likely significantly underreported, according to an analysis by the UCLA School of Law COVID-19 Behind Bars Data Project.

Last year, Meek Mill and Jay-Z co-founded REFORM alongside Fanatics owner Michael Rubin and New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft. The organization has already sent 100,000 facemasks to several U.S. correctional facilities.

""I don't think the public yet knows that there's no way to end the pandemic outside of prisons if we don't end it inside of prisons,"" Pilon added. ""It's really important that we look at the solutions to ending this holistically. Prisons are eight of the top 10 hotspots, so people need to care about them.""",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jay-z-meek-mill-reform-alliance-face-masks-ppe-prisons-jails-jack-dorsey-coronavirus/
California drought officially over after more than seven years,California drought officially over after more than seven years,1.0,"California is officially free of drought after more than seven years, drought monitors said Thursday.

The Golden State has experienced some form of drought for 376 consecutive weeks, the National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska, tweeted. It’s the first time the state has been free of drought since Dec. 20, 2011.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration tweeted that weather in 2017 helped matters, but moderate drought persisted. Rainfall this winter further alleviated the drought, although 7 percent of the state remains ""abnormally dry.""

""The storms this year have really helped snowpacks, the reservoirs,"" said Jessica Blunden, a climatologist with NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information. Colder temperatures also helped prevent snow from melting off, she said.

This winter — the meteorological winter starts on Dec. 1 and ends at the end of February — has been the wettest in the United States as a whole since records started being kept in 1895, with an average across the nation of 9.01 inches, which is 2.22 inches above the nationwide average, Blunden said.

That precipitation has not just benefited California. ""It’s been a great winter for the West,"" she said.

The U.S. Drought Monitor website, which is an effort by several agencies including NOAA and the national drought mitigation center, says that well-above precipitation in the West helped build snow pack and fill reservoirs, and that normal conditions have returned to the Salton Sea in the southeastern part of the state.

The Los Angeles area experienced cool winter temperatures that brought the fifth-longest streak of 41 consecutive days with a high temperature below 70 degrees since records began in 1877. Rare snowfall was reported in parts of the Los Angeles area in February.

Nearly 18 inches — 17.99 — of rain fell in downtown Los Angeles from Oct. 1 through Thursday, which is over 5 inches above normal, said Kristen Stewart, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Oxnard.

A ""super bloom"" of poppies has been reported in Lake Elsinore southeast of Los Angeles, and Anza-Borrego Desert State Park northeast of San Diego reported ""great displays of wildflowers"" this week that could last into April because of cool weather and moisture.

The National Weather Service’s Sacramento office tweeted Wednesday that a wet February and March has pushed water year numbers ""well above average"" with parts of the northern Sierras at 136 percent of normal, Sacramento at 126 percent of normal and Redding at 120 percent.

Former Gov. Jerry Brown declared an emergency drought declaration in 2014 and in 2015 ordered urban areas to reduce water use by 25 percent. A campaign also urged drivers to ""go dirty for the drought"" and to not wash their vehicles.

Brown lifted the drought emergency in most of California in 2017, warning ""the next drought could be around the corner."" He added that ""conservation must remain a way of life.""

Some parts of Southern California remain ""abnormally dry due to very dry previous years,"" the U.S. Drought Monitor said on its website. Reservoirs in San Diego County are at 65 percent capacity, and Big Bear Lake was down 18 feet in early March, but levels are expected to rise, it said in weekly drought summary.

The areas listed as abnormally dry were in the southern part of the state, including parts of Orange, Riverside, San Diego and Imperial counties, as well as a small portion in the northern part of the state in Siskiyou County along the Oregon border, according to the drought monitor.

In December, 75 percent of California was in ""moderate drought,"" up from 47 percent in March, according to the monitor.

Conditions can change that quickly, and they can change back to dry conditions as well, Blunden said.

""This happened last year: It was a wet winter, there were beautiful blooms in the spring and then it dried out really fast,"" Blunden said, adding, ""Don't be complacent, because it can change pretty quickly.""

And about those ""Go Dirty for the Drought"" decals?

B.C. woman finally meets her Australian pen pal after nearly 60 years of friendship,Canadian woman finally meets her Australian pen pal after nearly 60 years of friendship,1.0,"Send this page to someone via email

Nearly 60 years after first sending letters to each other across the Pacific Ocean, a B.C. woman has finally met her Australian pen pal in person.

Dolores Baily of Pitt Meadows hopped a plane to Sydney this month to meet Lyn Carpenter, who first corresponded with Baily after getting a Canadian address to write to in 1960.

After taking a bus to Carpenter’s home in Adelaide, the longtime friends shared their first long hug at the bus station Tuesday night.

“It’s just a formality, meeting in person,” Baily said on a patio in Adelaide the next day with Carpenter at her side.

“Don’t you feel like you’ve already known me?” Baily asked Carpenter, who nodded in agreement. “Because that’s how I feel about you.”

The pair became fast friends after starting their correspondence when they were both 10 years old, sharing interests in music and hobbies throughout their adolescence and into adulthood.

“We were both mad Beatles fans,” Carpenter said with a laugh. “We got through those teenage years together.”

Those early packages would sometimes include more than just letters, Baily said.

“We both used to sew, and we would send little fabric samples of things we were sewing at the time in the mail back and forth.”

As the physical letters transformed through the years into emails and text messages, the women continued to share milestones: they’re both married with two children and have both become grandparents.

“When we had children, we did have a bit of a gap where we didn’t write,” Carpenter said. “I can’t remember who got it going again, but one of us must have realized two years was too long.”

The closest the pair got to meeting before was a few phone calls, which only uncovered more similarities, including their love of choir singing.

Chemotherapy-free 'cancer vaccine' moves from mice to human trials at Stanford,Chemotherapy-free ‘cancer vaccine’ moves from mice to human trials at Stanford,1.0,"A recent Stanford cancer study that cured 97 percent of mice from tumors has now moved on to soliciting human volunteers for a new cutting-edge medical trial.

The trial is part of a gathering wave of research into immunotherapy, a type of treatment that fights cancer by using the body's immune system to attack tumors.

""Getting the immune system to fight cancer is one of the most recent developments in cancer,"" Dr. Ronald Levy, a Stanford oncology professor who is leading the study, told SFGATE. ""People need to know that this is in its early days and we are still looking for safety and looking to make this as good as it can be.""

ALSO TRENDING: Terrified Grayhound passengers stage mutiny while bus flies down highway

The treatment is not a true vaccine that creates lasting immunity, but it does feature a vaccine-like injection carrying two immune stimulators that activate the immune system's T cells to eliminate tumors throughout the body.

Each test subject receives a low dose of radiation plus two rounds of the injected agents, Levy said. No chemotherapy is involved.

The treatment does not work on all types of cancer, Levy said, because each type of cancer has a different set of rules regarding how it can be affected by the immune system.

For the current trials, he is only looking for people with low-grade lymphoma regardless if they have been previously treated. He said Stanford is planning on running two trials by the end of the year with a total of about 35 test subjects.

""The two drugs we are injecting are made by two different companies and have already been proven safe for people,"" Levy said. ""It's the combination we are testing.""

Side effects at this point include fever and soreness at the injection site but no vomiting, Levy said.

He said if the FDA does end up granting final approval, he wouldn't expect it any sooner than a year or two from now.

ALSO READ: Cancer breakthrough? 97 percent of mice cured in Stanford vaccine study

While the vaccine approach to cancer is unique, Levy noted that one approved cancer drug for injection already exists for melanoma skin cancer.

Other limited approaches also currently exist in the expanding landscape for cancer immunotherapy. In 2017, the FDA approved a type of cell therapy for some types of leukemia and lymphoma known as CAR-T where a patient's immune cells are removed from the body, genetically engineered and reintroduced to attack the tumor cells.

Dr. Michelle Hermiston directs the pediatric immunotherapy program at UCSF, the first hospital in California to implement the treatment. She told SFGATE that CAR-T is currently being used as a third option for lymphoma and leukemia patients who have failed standard treatments like chemotherapy.

She said CAR-T is both labor intensive and very expensive — drugs alone cost half a million dollars — but that the new immunotherapy treatment has raised survival rates from about 10-15 percent to more than 60 percent.

""The thing to understand is how much of a game changer this is,"" she said. ""If it's your kid, it makes a huge difference.""

But CAR-T comes with its fair share of side effects: fever, confusion, organ failure and the chance of permanent loss of one's B cells — responsible for producing antibodies. ""It's not a trivial therapy,"" Hermiston said.

Hermiston said she is very interested in Levy's injection trials as well as other future advances in immunotherapy. One biological area of importance that demands further study, she said, was the difference between ""hot"" and ""cold"" tumors with respect to the body's immune system.

She said research has shown that unlike hot tumors, the immune system does not detect cold tumors — often associated with colon cancer. However, sometimes a combination of hot and cold may be at play. One main question, Hermiston said, is whether cold tumors can be transformed into hot tumors so that the immune system can first recognize and then destroy them.

""Can we make the tumor more visible to the immune system?"" Hermiston said. ""We are at the tip of the iceberg right now.""

Levy, along with Stanford instructor of medicine Idit Sagiv-Barfi, published their study on the cancer-curing effect of immunotherapy on January 31 in Science Translational Medicine. Levy is a pioneer in the field of cancer immunotherapy having contributed to the development of rituximab, one of the first monoclonal antibodies approved for use as an anti-cancer treatment in humans. In 2009 he received the King Faisal International Prize — often known as the ""Arab Nobel Prize""— for this achievement.

""We have a huge problem in cancer and we will never be satisfied until we find solutions for everyone,"" Levy said.",https://m.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Chemotherapy-free-cancer-vaccine-moves-from-12777406.php
'It's like Connacht winning against the All Blacks': Supermac's CEO responds to Big Mac trademark success against McDonald's,David vs. Goliath: Small Irish burger joint wins Big Mac trademark battle against McDonald's,1.0,"Supermac’s has won a long running battle against McDonald’s to have the use of the iconic Big Mac trademark cancelled across Europe.

In April 2017, the Irish firm formally submitted a request to the European Union Property Office (EUIPO) to cancel the use of the Big Mac and Mc trademarks that McDonald’s has registered in certain classes.

Supermac’s had asked the EU regulator that this take effect on the basis that McDonald’s is engaged in ""trademark bullying; registering brand names... which are simply stored away in a war chest to use against future competitors"".

Now, in a landmark Europe-wide judgement, that has immediate effect, EUIPO said that the multinational had not proven genuine use of the Big Mac trademark as a restaurant name - or as a burger.

""It follows from the above that the EUTM proprietor has not proven genuine use of the contested EUTM for any of the goods and services for which it is registered. As a result, the application for revocation is wholly successful and the contested EUTM must be revoked in its entirety. According to Article 62(1) EUTMR, the revocation will take effect from the date of the application for revocation, that is, as of 11/04/2017.""

Speaking to Independent.ie following the decision, Supermac’s MD, Pat McDonagh said that the judgement represents a victory for small businesses all over the world.

""It's been a long road, nearly four years, but it was worth it to help protect businesses that are trying to compete against faceless multinationals.

""Never mind David versus Goliath, this unique landmark decision is akin to the Connacht team winning against the All Blacks.""

McDonald’s previously hit Supermacs with a 41-page objection against its plans to use the Supermac’s name in Europe stating that it would ""take unfair advantage of the distinctive character and repute"" of trademarks previous won by the global restaurant giant.

The US firm partly based its objection on already secured trademarks for its products such as the ‘Big Mac’ and ‘Chicken McNuggets’, claiming introducing Supermac’s into the market would cause confusion.

This latest EUIPO judgement could mean that the main argument put forward by the US company is now gone.

""The original objective of our application to cancel was to shine a light on the use of trademark bullying by this multinational to stifle competition,"" said Mr McDonagh.

""We had a very good team working behind it and it took a lot of meetings and discussions to bring everything to this point.

""This now opens the door for the decision to be made by the European trademark office to allow us to use our SuperMac's as a burger across Europe. We are going to continue to pursue that.""

These companies give staff paid time off when they get a puppy,These companies give staff paid time off when they get a new puppy,1.0,"Anyone who has experienced getting a puppy knows it can be hard work. Owners often refer to their pets as ""fur babies,"" which makes a lot of sense considering how much attention puppies require when you first get them.

Puppies need time to settle into their new home and bond with their owners. They've probably just been taken from their mothers and introduced to a brand new environment, so there's likely to be a lot of crying. And that's before you can even think about house-training.

As it turns out, some companies sympathise with this transition and offer what's known as ""pawternity leave."" In fact, research from Petplan found that 5% of owners have been offered paid leave from their job to adjust to their pet owning duties.

These are some of the companies which give you a few days off to bond with your new best friend.

Mars Petcare

Mars Petcare was one of the first companies to offer pawternity leave. The company offers its employees ten hours of paid leave when they get a new pet, and they can bring them into the office after that.

BitSol Solutions

A tech company based in Manchester called BitSol Solutions offers its employees a full week of paid leave if they get a new pet. According to the Metro, company owner Greg Buchanan said: ""Pets are like babies nowadays, so why shouldn't staff have some time off when they arrive?""

BrewDog

Scottish brewery company BrewDog has just started offering a week of paid leave. The reason given on the BrewDog website is that they just really love dogs. Also, it aims to be ""the best company to work for, ever.""

Some companies offer pet bereavement leave too

There's also a growing trend to offer employees time off when their pets die. Losing your furry friend is devastating, and more and more companies are sympathising.

Kimpton Hotels & Restaurants in San Francisco offers three days leave, Mars Inc offers one day and flexible hours, California-based software company VMware and Boston-based Maxwell Health both offer flexible days, and Trupanion, a Seattle-based pet insurance company, offers employees one day. Canadian company Shoppers Drug Mart lets employees take days off if they have a loss in the family, and they say that includes a beloved pet.

He picked it up and they walked a bit. It was only when he looked inside that he saw a maze of wires hooked up to makeshift pipe bombs.

Mr Parker and his friend, Ivan White, took the bag to a remote area in case the explosives detonated and went straight to the police.

Since then, they have been hailed as heroes for potentially saving the lives of hundreds on a weekend that saw bombs also planted in Manhattan and Seaside Park, NJ.

One man who was particularly moved was Donald Goncalves, a 52-year-old, lifelong resident of Elizabeth.

“I care a lot about my town,” he said in an interview on Friday. “I used to be a commuter to New York myself. It touched me in a very profound way. How could I take what could have been a devastating moment and turn it into something positive?”

Mr Goncalves turned to online crowdfunding, hoping to raise just a little bit of money as a token of appreciation for the men. He set a goal of $10,000 that would be split three ways between them and the Elizabeth Coalition to House the Homeless, a local non-profit organisation that has already found Parker an apartment, Mr Goncalves said. Mr White lives in subsidised housing on a fixed income.

Within days, the GoFundMe page that Mr Goncalves set up had doubled its goal, and has raised more than $28,000 (£21,600).

Mr Goncalves, who has become a spokesman for Mr Parker and Mr White – he has had inquiries for talk-show appearances and from the National Football League’s New York Jets to honour them at a game – said he is eager to get the money distributed. Some have criticised his decision to give the local homeless organisation a third of the money, but Mr Goncalves felt it was important to give something to the group that will help Mr Parker get back on his feet.

Mr Parker didn’t make it to his job interview on Monday morning – he was going to apply to load trucks – because he was still being interviewed by law enforcement. But Mr Goncalves said a large food company based in Elizabeth has already been in touch about giving Mr Parker a job.

The men were interviewed by ABC7NY this week and downplayed their roles as heroes.

“I’m just glad I was able to realise what the situation was and react in such a way that, thank goodness, no one got hurt,” Mr White told the TV station.

“Hero? No. I wouldn’t go that far. [I was] doing the right thing,” Mr Parker added.

Mr Goncalves said that when he found Mr Parker to tell him he was raising money for him, all Mr Parker said in response was that he was hungry and needed to get food.

(Don Goncalves (Don Goncalves)

“Eight thousand dollars is a lot to him, but it’s nothing for us. From our perspective, it’s chump change for what he did for us. It’s just a token for him to understand how significant his contribution was to society,” Mr Goncalves said. “This is America, and these stories of heroism and celebrity is the type of stuff we thrive upon, but it’s so nice to see common guys like Lee and Ivan be the recipients of it.”

As for that backpack Parker wanted? He now owns two.

Vaccination method that wiped out smallpox gets unleashed today on Ebola,Vaccination method that wiped out smallpox gets unleashed today on Ebola,1.0,"With more than 7,500 doses of an experimental vaccine against Ebola, health officials today began a vaccination campaign to try to thwart the latest outbreak of the deadly virus in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

According to the World Health Organization, the campaign will start with healthcare workers operating in areas affected by the outbreak. Then officials will focus on a “ring vaccination” strategy, which targets people who have had contact with someone with a confirmed case of Ebola, as well as people who have had contact with those contacts. (This creates rings of vaccination around each case, hence the name). These defensive social circles ensure that those most vulnerable to contracting the virus are protected while also preventing the spread of the virus from the most likely sources. The same strategy was critical during the campaign in the 1960s and ‘70s to eradicate smallpox—the only human disease that has ever been successfully wiped out.

The Ebola-vaccination campaign will take place in the DRC’s northwestern Equator Province (Province de l’Équateur), where there have been 46 confirmed, probable, or suspected cases, including 26 deaths, as of May 18. Officials have already identified 600 contacts and contacts of contacts of cases. Nearly all cases and contacts have been in the remote town of Bikoro. But officials counted four confirmed cases in Mbandaka, a provincial capital with more than a million residents. This has raised concerns about the potential for the outbreak to explode.

The more than 7,500 doses of vaccine already in the DRC are enough to cover approximately 50 rings of 150 people, the WHO notes. An additional 8,000 doses are on their way to the country, arriving in the next few days.

The experimental vaccine—rVSVΔG-ZEBOV—has not been approved by relevant regulatory authorities, but the WHO has given it the greenlight under an expanded access/compassionate-use protocol. The organization has reason to be optimistic that the vaccine will squash the outbreak.

Trial by fire

The vaccine is a live, chimeric virus capable of replicating in cells. It has the backbone of the relatively harmless vesicular stomatitis virus, which tends to infect cattle and only causes mild disease in humans. This engineered virus also carries the code for Ebola’s glycoprotein. This is a protein that hangs on the outside of Ebola viruses and allows them to invade and infect human cells. On the vaccine virus, the protein can prompt the human immune system to develop protective responses against the real Ebola.

In early work, rVSVΔG-ZEBOV protected mice, hamsters, guinea pigs, and non-human primates from Ebola. In 2015, an international team of researchers conducted trials of ring vaccination in Guinea and Sierra Leone, vaccinating nearly 6,000 within 117 rings. The results suggested that the vaccine was generally safe and 100-percent effective at preventing Ebola. None of those vaccinated developed Ebola virus disease, whereas there were 23 cases among contacts in the trial who were either not vaccinated or received a delayed vaccination.

Despite high hopes for the vaccine in this outbreak, the ring campaign won’t be easy to pull off in such a remote area of the DRC. “Implementing the Ebola ring vaccination is a complex procedure,” Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa, said in a statement. “The vaccines need to be stored at a temperature of minus 60 to minus 80 degrees centigrade, and so transporting them to and storing them in affected areas is a major challenge.”

So far, WHO, local health authorities, Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF aka Doctors Without Borders), and other partners have established an air bridge and have used helicopters and motorbikes to get around and deliver supplies. They’ve also transported the vaccine in containers that maintain sub-zero conditions for up to a week and have set up freezers in Bikoro and Mbandaka.

As officials scramble, they hope the efforts are enough. “We need to act fast to stop the spread of Ebola by protecting people at risk of being infected with the Ebola virus, identifying and ending all transmission chains, and ensuring that all patients have rapid access to safe, high-quality care,” Dr. Peter Salama, WHO deputy director-general for Emergency Preparedness and Response, added in a statement.",https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/05/vaccination-method-that-wiped-out-smallpox-gets-unleashed-today-on-ebola/

Handing out money for free harder than it looks

Opinion | Jennifer Wells: Wynne’s basic income experiment deserves to live a full life

Ontario launches basic income pilot for 4,000 in Hamilton, Thunder Bay, Lindsay

The three-year pilot project, which began in the Hamilton and Thunder Bay areas last summer and in Lindsay last fall, is testing whether unconditional cash support can boost health, education and housing for people on social assistance or earning low wages.

Information gleaned from the three test sites will guide future provincial policy on how to better support all Ontarians living in poverty.

The province is among several areas in the world experimenting with the idea of a basic income, including Finland, which began a two-year pilot last January.

After couch-surfing for almost two years, Moore, 60, is using her basic income payment to look for stable housing.

“My biggest focus is getting my own place and giving poor John his apartment back,” said Moore, who has been sleeping on her friend’s living room sofa for about a year.

Before joining the program in October, the single mother of six and grandmother of 12 was “barely surviving” on $330 a month in basic needs allowance from Ontario Works, the province’s welfare program for people without disabilities.

Her total income for 2016 was $4,247.

Because Moore was homeless, she was not eligible for a shelter allowance that would have brought her monthly Ontario Works payment to just over $700.

But under the basic income experiment, Moore receives $1,416 a month, an amount that remains constant no matter where she lives.

“It is giving me back my independence,” she said. “I don’t feel so backed into a corner. If I want to eat, I can afford to buy something instead of going to a food bank or a soup kitchen.”

Moore and the others are among almost 3,000 people enrolled so far in the test sites. The province hopes to recruit 6,000 participants, including 4,000 who will receive a basic income, fill out surveys and participate in focus groups as part of the study.

A further 2,000 won’t get the monthly payments but will be paid to complete surveys and tracked as a control group.

Thunder Bay heating and fireplace installer Taras Harapyuk, who hasn’t worked since 2015 when he fell lifting a ladder out of his truck, signed up for the pilot project last September. He learned last week that his application was randomly selected as part of the control group.

“I was very disappointed to hear I wasn’t chosen to get the extra money,” Harapyuk said. “But I will fill out the surveys. I am happy to help.”

Adults in the three test sites age 18 to 64 with incomes under $34,000 before taxes and deductions, or couples with incomes under $48,000, are eligible. The income cut-off for individuals with disabilities is $46,000.

If participants find employment or get a better job, their basic income payments are reduced by 50 cents for every dollar earned until they are no longer financially eligible. But unlike social assistance, which is adjusted monthly, basic income payments are calculated once a year, based on the participant’s previous year’s income tax return.

Project administrators can make mid-year adjustments if participants lose a job or go back to school, change a living arrangement or become disabled.

After a slow start last summer, enrolment topped 2,544 at the end of January and the project is on track to be fully enrolled by the summer, the government says.

“We are well on our way to reaching full enrolment of participants into the pilot and have the measures in place to ensure this study is conducted with the utmost integrity, rigour and ethical standards,” said Social Services Minister Helena Jaczek and Housing Minister Peter Milczyn, the government’s co-chairs for the pilot project.

“What we learn from this pilot will help inform our longer-term plans to better support people living on low incomes,” they said in a joint statement.

Goold, 60, who has a developmental disability and suffers from severe arthritis, was receiving about $1,400 a month from the Ontario Disability Support Program (ODSP) before her first basic income payment arrived in October.

Since then, her monthly income has increased by 28 per cent to $1,806.

In addition to being able to buy a new walker “with all the bells and whistles” for about $500, the extra money allowed her to take her husband, Don, to the Keg for his 65th birthday this month.

“It’s nice to be able to celebrate a milestone like everybody else,” she said.

Fellow Hamilton resident Alana Baltzer, 28, traded her $722 monthly ODSP benefit for a basic income of $1,915 in October.

It meant Baltzer, who had previously shopped only at thrift stores, was able to take advantage of Black Friday sales in November to buy her first new winter coat.

“It has certainly come in handy with the cold weather,” she said.

Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading... Loading...

While the cash means the cost of Baltzer’s rent-geared-to-income bachelor apartment will rise to $520 from $200 a month, her spending money has almost tripled.

After growing up on welfare and living in social housing most of her life, Baltzer says basic income could allow her to move into market housing “away from all the fighting and noise.”

“This has already been a huge life-change for me,” she said. “I have a full fridge. I am eating more healthy food.”

And she says she can finally afford a mouth guard to help correct chronic teeth problems caused by years of poor eating.

She has opened a tax-free savings account and hopes to find someone to help manage her finances.

“It still hasn’t sunk in that I can afford things,” she said.

Some participants may squander the money, said Laura Cattari, 48, part-time co-ordinator with the Hamilton Roundtable for Poverty Reduction. But as someone who relied on social assistance for 12 years after being diagnosed with fibromyalgia and other health problems, Cattari believes people in the study are more likely to be reluctant to spend.

For example, Cattari says, it took her more than a year after landing her job at the roundtable in 2016 before she felt comfortable buying something as basic as a new sweater.

“That’s what deprivation does over the long-term. It makes you afraid to change. Basic income will make people healthier and less stressed, for sure. But it takes time,” she said.

“To change attitudes and outlook, people need to feel comfortable and not stressed. And I’m not sure three years is long enough.”

Kwame McKenzie, the province’s special adviser on the initiative, says researchers would love to have 10 years to study the effect of a basic income.

But with automation and the rapidly changing workplace, government needs information quickly to help guide possible changes to social assistance, said McKenzie, CEO of the Wellesley Institute health think-tank and director of health equity at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health.

The project is being independently assessed by researchers from St. Michael’s Hospital and McMaster University who will track changes in employment, health, education, food security and housing through surveys and focus groups.

“We won’t be comparing one person to another person. We will be looking at groups of people who get the basic income compared to people who don’t,” he said.

In Lindsay, a so-called “saturation site” where about 2,000 residents, or almost everyone living in poverty, will receive the basic income, researchers will also be assessing how the community changes.

“We will be looking at things like the level of unemployment and crime and comparing it to three or four other places that are as close to the GTA as Lindsay with the same size of population,” McKenzie said.

Lindsay resident Kathy Mahood, 53, who joined the pilot project in October, says she has already seen a difference in the community of about 22,000 just north of Peterborough.

“People are relieved and happy for the extra help,” she said. “I really notice it when the cheques start coming out at the end of the month. The stores are much busier. The town is busy, busy. A lot busier than it was before. There are lineups at the grocery store. It’s definitely injecting more money into the community.”

Mahood fell into deep poverty after a work-related back injury and the death of her husband two years ago.

When she joined the pilot project in October, she was living on about $735 a month in federal Canada Pension Plan disability benefits and proceeds from the sale of her house.

“I figured I had a year and a half left before I would lose my apartment and have to rent a room. It was pretty frightening,” she said.

But with $1,200 in basic income every month on top of her disability benefits, Mahood has money for rent and healthy food — and has begun making regular payments to clear her credit card debt.

“If I am careful, I should be debt-free when the program ends in three years,” she said.

Mahood was able to buy modest Christmas gifts for her four grandchildren in December. She could afford to buy ingredients for Christmas baking. She can put gas in her car and has money for repairs.

“I feel healthier and I am not stressed all the time about money,” she said.

Back in Hamilton, Lance Dingman, 56, acknowledges some people may be afraid to switch to basic income, which, unlike social assistance, is not off limits to debt collectors.

But the thought of losing everything didn’t dissuade Dingman, who has been on ODSP for most of his life because of chronic osteomyelitis, a bone disease that cost him his right leg in 1990.

“We’re all fighting for a break,” he said. “Well, the break is here, so let’s make the best of it.”

"Plastic Bags to Be Banned in New York; Second Statewide Ban, After California",Plastic bags to be banned in New York state.,1.0,"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]

ALBANY — New York State lawmakers have agreed to impose a statewide ban on most types of single-use plastic bags from retail sales, changing a way of life for millions of New Yorkers as legislators seek to curb an unsightly and omnipresent source of litter.

The plan, proposed a year ago by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, would be the second statewide ban, after California, which banned bags in 2016. Hawaii also effectively has a ban in place, since all the state’s counties bar such single-use bags.

New York’s ban, which would begin next March, would forbid stores to provide customers with single-use plastic bags, which are nonbiodegradable and have been blamed for everything from causing gruesome wildlife deaths to thwarting recycling efforts.

The ban, which is expected to be part of the state’s budget bills that are slated to be passed by Monday, would have a number of carveouts, including food takeout bags used by restaurants, bags used to wrap deli or meat counter products and bags for bulk items. Newspaper bags would also be exempted, as would garment bags and bags sold in bulk, such as trash or recycling bags.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/nyregion/plastic-bag-ban-.html
Minister to outlaw sex with people who've fallen asleep drunk,Ireland to outlaw sex with people who've fallen asleep drunk,1.0,"A definition of 'sexual consent' to be approved by Government today will explicitly outlaw engaging in a sexual act with someone who has passed out from intoxication.

Justice Minister Frances Fitzgerald will seek Cabinet backing today for the laws which seek to prevent people being ""taken advantage of"".

The legislation will also introduce extra protections for people with disabilities who may not be able to communicate their consent.

The Law Reform Commission was recommending that definition of consent be written into law as far back as the 1980s.

Sources told the Irish Independent that Mrs Fitzgerald's proposed definition will ""make it clear that a person who is incapable of consenting to a sexual act due to, for instance, being asleep or unconscious, as a result of intoxication"" cannot give consent.

Currently, Irish law states that rape occurs if a person has not consented to intercourse and/or if the perpetrator was reckless as to whether the victim did or did not consent.

However, the courts have had to create their own definitions of consent.

There will also be new and strengthened offences to tackle child pornography, along with new provisions to be introduced regarding evidence by victims, particularly children.

Another element of the Bill is to criminalise the purchase of sexual services. ""When enacted, the bill will bring Irish law into line with a number of international legal instruments,"" a source said.

Information Detail,"Los Angeles offers tattoo removal for inmates who regret a tattoo, or no longer wish to be associated with gangs and lifestyle to give them a wider employment opportunity when released from prison.",1.0,"

Tattoo Removal Program Offers Inmates a Clean Slate







Supporting Inmate Accountability



Inmates in the custody of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department may participate in its Tattoo Removal Service, a joint program of the Inmate Services Bureau's Education Based Incarceration (EBI) unit, the Medical Services Bureau, and Homeboy Industries. Once considered permanent, tattoos are now removable through laser treatments. The highly successful Tattoo Removal Service uses that advanced technology, and benefits inmates who commit to bettering themselves while in custody so they can re-enter our communities truly with ""a clean slate.""



The Tattoo Removal Service incentivizes inmates to engage in structured academic, vocational, life-skills and other learning opportunities offered by EBI, as participation in those courses and activities makes them eligible for tattoo removal treatments.







Matching Inmate Motivations to Community Interests



Inmates regret having gotten tattoos for varying reasons. Some acquired their first tattoo as young as eleven years old, before they could make a wise decision. For others, a tattoo not done by a skilled professional has produced an unsightly or distorted image. And almost all inmates have experienced the negative social stigma attached to any tattoo--compounded when it's offensive or prominently displayed on the face, neck, or hands. An employer's no-tattoo policy, formal or not, limits released inmates' job and advancement opportunities. Finally, many tattoos are gang-related, and inmates may no longer wish to be associated with that lifestyle. No matter the reason, the Tattoo Removal Program gives these inmates a fresh start, and facilitates their re-integration into the community.







Program Process, History and Success



The tattoo removal process uses a medical-grade laser to produce a short pulse of intense light, which passes through the top layers of skin and is selectively absorbed by the tattoo pigment. This light breaks down the tattoo ink, which is then absorbed by the body, and the tattoo fades. Most patients need three to eight sessions, scheduled every eight weeks, to remove a tattoo completely. Many inmates start by getting one or two tattoos lasered to see the results; not uncommonly, they request treatment of other tattoos because removal is so successful If the removal process takes longer than the inmate's sentence, EBI coordinates with Homeboy Industries to complete the removal at no cost to the released inmate.



The Tattoo Removal Service began in February 2012 as a collaborative partnership between the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Medical Services Bureau, its Inmate Services Bureau, and Homeboy Industries. The service is overseen by trained medical personnel and a custody assistant. The program piloted with 25 volunteer inmates and has expanded greatly, as seen in yearly totals of treated inmates:







2012



Male 276



Female 260



Total 536







2013



Male 274



Female 274



Total 548







2014



Male 206



Female 184

(Note: The tattoo clinic closed from early August to December 2014 to repair the laser machine.)







2015 (January 6 to September 15)



Male 421



Female 353



Total 774







A Priceless Benefit at No Private or Public Cost



At outside facilities, removal of a single tattoo ranges in price from $200 to $500 per session. If we recall that full removal may require five to twenty sessions, we see that removing one tattoo might run $10,000. The clinic currently owns four tattoo removal machines; the first cost approximately $100,000 while each subsequent machine cost $65,000. An allocation of $300,000 for the Service also covers additional expenses of overtime and security. Yet the Inmate Welfare Fund fully pays for all expenditures connected to the Tattoo Removal Service, incurring no additional outlay from the Sheriff's Department or the public. Recall also that if the removal process takes longer than an inmate's sentence, EBI and Homeboy Industries cooperate to finish the released inmate's treatment for absolutely no fee.







The Tattoo Removal Service gives inmates a visible change for the better and receives overwhelmingly positive feedback from participants. The tattoo clinic, along with EBI's academic, vocational and life-skills training, stands as one of the Department's most powerful means of helping inmates secure employment, gain community acceptance, and thus reduce their likelihood of recidivating.

Dancing dad whose video went viral announces son is cancer free,Dad who went viral after dancing for sick toddler announces son is cancer free.,1.0,"Nearly three million people have viewed a video of dad Kennith Thomas dancing for his toddler son, Kristian. But the New Jersey father says his dance moves were for an audience of one — a way to encourage Kristian as he was being treated for acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL).

The support Thomas showed his young son paid off: In November, Thomas and his wife, Josilyne, received the news that Kristian, who was diagnosed with AMKL at just 14 months old, was cancer free.

Kennith Thomas' son, Kristian, was diagnosed with leukemia at 14 months old. Kennith Thomas

""It was the most glorifying thing you could ever feel,"" Thomas told TODAY Parents. ""When your 1 year old is going through a huge battle, as a parent you want to take their place — you don't want them to have to suffer.""

In Thomas' initial viral video, he dances for Kristian to Ciara song ""Level Up,"" while Kristian claps and smiles. (The Thomas' own a dance studio and Josilyne is also a photographer.) Thomas says the video, which was posted in July, was filmed after he learned they would finally be able to take Kristian home from the hospital after staying for more than 30 days for his first round of chemotherapy and treatment.

""He was going home that day,"" Thomas recalled. ""His levels were up and we were going home — it all fell into place, so I put the video out there and it just caught fire.""

During the months Kristian was undergoing treatment, Thomas' Instagram account grew from 5,000 followers to more than 70,000. Ciara herself took notice of the family's story and reached out to Josilyne Thomas about surprising Kennith and Kristian.

""Today I had one of the best times in life,"" the singer tweeted after her visit with the family at their dance studio. ""I got to meet the rock star Kristian... he's surrounded by an abundance of love.""

"Fyre Festival victim recoups more than $100,000 in GoFundMe donations after scam","Fyre Festival victim recoups more than $100,000 in GoFundMe donations after scam",1.0,"A Bahamian caterer who accepted a ""good faith contract"" with the fraudulent Fyre Festival founder Billy McFarland to prep thousands of meals and provide lodging for VIP partygoers —and found herself cooking without pay for stranded festival patrons — has raised more than $170,000 through a GoFundMe campaign.

Maryann Rolle, proprietor of the Exuma Point Bar and Grille, near the site of the disastrous Fyre Festival, said she dipped into her life's savings to pay workers who labored around the clock — even though she herself never saw a dime.

""I do catering on a large scale but I have never pushed myself to do a thousand meals a day. It was something new for me and it was challenging. I was being busy for them and not thinking of me and getting my money,"" she told CBS MoneyWatch.

The music event billed as a VIP experience featuring Blink-182 and other musical acts quickly devolved into a barbaric retreat whose ""luxury accommodations"" included unfinished tents and drenched mattresses. Organizer Billy McFarland, 27, is currently serving six years in prison for a fraud estimated to have stolen $27.4 million from investors. His partner, rapper Ja Rule, insists he, too, was ""hustled, scammed, bamboozled, hoodwinked, led astray.""

I too was hustled, scammed, bamboozled, hood winked, lead astray!!! — Ja Rule (@Ruleyork) January 20, 2019

Rolle said she catered approximately 1,000 meals a day in April 2017 and also hosted festival organizers at Exuma Point Resort, which she co-owns with her husband.

""I had ten persons working directly with me, just preparing food all day and all night, 24 hours,"" she said in the Netflix documentary, ""Fyre: The Greatest Party That Never Happened.""

She describes the desperation of her current financial situation as a result on her fundraising page.

""As I make this plea it's hard to believe and embarrassing to admit that I was not paid...I was left in a big hole! My life was changed forever, and my credit was ruined by Fyre Fest,"" Rolle and her husband, Elvis, wrote. ""My only resource today is to appeal for help,"" they said. As of Monday more than 4,000 people had contributed a total surpassing $131,000 to the couple's campaign.

Rolle told CBS MoneyWatch she honored her contract in hopes that the company behind the failed festival would bring business to the island later down the line.

""I did it because I wanted the event to be a success. I knew if it was a success they would pay me well. They assured me they would pay me well,"" she said.

But she was duped. ""People would come down and say they were managers and they would wire transfer me the money. I gave them my information and the money was never transferred,"" she said.

She estimates she is owed more than $140,000, and says she tore through an additional $50,000 in savings to pay her workers.

Receipts back it up. ""I still have them all in the glove compartment of my car,"" she said.

Rolle says that for the first time in months she can see the light at the end of the tunnel. The GoFundMe campaign has provided her with a sense of relief and appreciation for the people who contributed to her cause.

""It makes me feel so happy to know there are people who care. If I get another $50,000, I will be a very happy camper,"" she said.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fyre-festival-bahamian-restaurant-owners-gofundme-campaign-recoups-more-than-100000-from-scam/
Mexico Eliminates Infectious Disease Which Is Leading Cause of Blindness,"In a significant public health victory, Mexico has succeeded in eliminating a disease which is the leading cause of blindness worldwide.",1.0,"In a significant public health victory, Mexico has succeeded in eliminating a disease which is the leading cause of blindness worldwide.

The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) announced Monday that Mexico is the first country in the Americas to eliminate trachoma as a public health issue. The disease, caused by a bacteria, affects the eye and repeated infections can lead to scarring and even loss of vision.

It primarily affects young children, and can be spread by personal contact or by flies that that have been in contact with the discharge from the eyes or nose of an infected person.

""This is a historic moment for public health in Mexico and the Americas,"" said Carissa F. Etienne, Director of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), WHO regional office for the Americas. ""Eliminating a disease is not achieved every day.""

Trachoma primarily affects poor and isolated populations in 41 countries; in the Americas, the disease is still prevalent in Brazil, Guatemala, and Colombia.

Mexico has become the third country, after Oman and Morocco, to receive WHO validation for eliminating the disease.

In Mexico, trachoma affected over 146,000 people. The country ramped up its actions in 2004 with the creation of the Trachoma Prevention and Control Program of the Ministry of Health of Chiapas and the strengthening of the WHO SAFE strategy. The ""Trachoma Brigades"" focused on cleanliness, antibiotics, environmental improvement and surgery for the advanced stage of the disease.

The program’s slogan was “With water, soap and cleanliness you can prevent trachoma.” Teachers at schools would also meet with parents regularly to promote better hygiene.

The international criteria for the elimination of trachoma as a public health problem includes prevalence of less than 5 percent in children aged 1 to 9, and less than one case of trachomatous trichiasis (inverted eyelashes) per 1,000 inhabitants.

US universities honor Saudi students who died trying to rescue kids,US universities honor Saudi students who died trying to rescue kids,1.0,"New outlook, new faces behind Saudi tourism revival

JEDDAH: As the pandemic appears to recede and the global travel sector returns to life, Saudi Arabia is bringing in heavyweights to help promote the country to an international audience looking for new horizons to explore.

In much of the world, tourists are waking up to new travel protocols and countries are finding new strategies to recover from the pandemic’s effects.

Others, such as Saudi Arabia, are tapping into the relatively new concept of “domestic tourism,” while also welcoming international visitors who want to discover hidden gems.

In an exclusive interview with Arab News, Gloria Guevara Manzo, newly appointed chief special adviser to the Saudi Tourism Minister, Ahmed Al-Khateeb said that the Kingdom’s young tourism sector has an opportunity to reset its tone and strategies with the help of key partners in both the Kingdom’s private and public sector as well as international partners.

BACK GROUND • Gloria Guevara Manzo, a former CEO and president of the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC), has more than 25 years’ experience in the travel and tourism industry. • As Mexico’s tourism secretary from 2010 to 2012, she oversaw a number of key transformations, dealing with the repercussions of the 2008 financial crisis and the H1N1 pandemic a year later — both of which heavily affected the industry. • Manzo was able to turn the industry around, making Mexico a global hotspot for tourism and creating a major jobs generator.

Manzo, a former CEO and president of the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC), has more than 25 years’ experience in the travel and tourism industry.

As Mexico’s tourism secretary from 2010 to 2012, she oversaw a number of key transformations, dealing with the repercussions of the 2008 financial crisis and the H1N1 pandemic a year later — both of which heavily affected the industry.

Manzo was able to turn the industry around, making Mexico a global hotspot for tourism and creating a major jobs generator.

As the first female to head the WTTC since its founding in 1991, she was responsible for the transformation of the organization, leading a global effort to unite the tourism industry and encourage it to speak with one voice.

Her recent appointment comes at a crucial time as the Kingdom prepares to reopen its doors to international travelers.

Having visited the Kingdom in 2019 as part of the “Open Saudi, Open Hearts, Open doors” event and the launch of a new tourist visa scheme, Manzo told Arab News that she found the culture welcoming and saw “tremendous potential.”

“I was very impressed with what I saw in 2019 and the commitment, of course, for the sector, and that’s what got me excited. I see an amazing opportunity to have Saudi become one of the top destinations in the world because it has the assets, it has the people, it has everything. So I’m quite excited for this opportunity to be part of this new transformation.”

IN NUMBERS $58bn New tourism investments worth SR220 billion ($58 million). $530m Fund to develop key destinations across the Kingdom.

The Kingdom opened its borders to international tourists in September 2019 with a target of 100 million visitors by 2030, and has since announced a number of mega-projects to attract travelers, as well as new tourism investments worth SR220 billion ($58 billion), and a $530 million fund to develop key destinations across the country.

But 2020 had a set of challenges that set back many plans for the Kingdom’s budding sector. However, with enough collaborative effort, experts believe that the Kingdom can bounce back faster than many European and other advanced economies.

“One of the biggest challenges in 2020 was not only the pandemic, it was the lack of international coordination or the opportunity for more international coordination and public and private collaboration in many countries,” said Manzo.

“Now, the good news is that we are leaders. Thank goodness, Saudi was the chair of the G20 because being the chair of the G20 helped us to foster that collaboration. Ahmed Al-Khateeb made history and Saudi Arabia made history because for the first time, he invited the private sector, 45 CEOs, to talk to the leaders of tourism. And Saudi Arabia made history because for the first time it was included in the declaration. And that was very important because before that, as I said, the collaboration was a challenge.”

Manzo believes that the Kingdom emerged as a leader, building bridges and encouraging collaboration, which is crucial for the global recovery.

I see an amazing opportunity to have Saudi become one of the top destinations in the world.

Gloria Guevara Manzo

After the easing of last year’s lockdown, residents of the Kingdom are rediscovering the Kingdom’s attractions, which has helped soften the blow.

According to Manzo, the sector can stay afloat by investing in the assets in its own backyard.

“Tourism in Saudi Arabia is very young. The launch was in 2019. We still are in the process of creating some interesting and iconic destinations, such as NEOM, the Red Sea Company, AlUla and others. But I believe that we already have an interesting offering for international travelers that is very appealing,” she said.

Saudi Arabia has opened several international tourism offices in major countries, targeting 28 markets in a global marketing push, but a number of challenges remain: Sustainability is key to the success of the sector, but accelerating the digital transformation and working with SMEs will help ensure continuation of international collaboration.

Having worked extensively in the private and public sectors, Manzo said that one of the perks of jobs in tourism is mobility. Travel contributed to 10 percent of global income, and one in 10 jobs depended on the sector.

“The good news is that here, we have a lot of potential and we have multiple sectors. And tourism offers great opportunity and jobs. What’s interesting is that people don’t have to move. The beauty about tourism is that you can create the jobs in your city, in your destination. For example, you live in Jeddah, it’s an amazing city, a beautiful city that can have a lot of visitors and create a lot of opportunities for the people,” she added.",http://www.arabnews.com/node/1372306/saudi-arabia
Analysis: UK renewables generate more electricity than fossil fuels for first time,"In the third quarter of 2019, the UK’s windfarms, solar panels, biomass and hydro plants generated more electricity than the combined output from power stations fired by coal, oil and gas, for the first time.",1.0,"In the third quarter of 2019, the UK’s windfarms, solar panels, biomass and hydro plants generated more electricity than the combined output from power stations fired by coal, oil and gas, Carbon Brief analysis reveals.

During the three months of July, August and September, renewables generated an estimated total of 29.5 terawatt hours (TWh), compared with just 29.1TWh from fossil fuels, the analysis shows.

This is the first-ever quarter where renewables outpaced fossil fuels since the UK’s first public electricity generating station opened in 1882. It is another symbolic milestone in the stunning transformation of the UK’s electricity system over the past decade.

Nevertheless, a lack of progress in other parts of the economy means the UK remains far off track against its upcoming legally-binding carbon targets, let alone the recently adopted goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

Transformative decade

At the start of this decade in 2010, the 288TWh generated from fossil fuels accounted for around three-quarters of the UK total. It was also more than 10 times as much electricity as the 26TWh that came from renewables.

Since then, electricity generation from renewable sources has more than quadrupled – and demand has fallen – leaving fossil fuels with a shrinking share of the total.

This shift is shown in the chart below, with the declining quarterly output from power stations burning coal, oil and gas in blue and rising generation from renewables in red.

(The quarterly chart also reflects the seasons, with demand higher in winter and lower in summer. Windfarm output is well matched with this cycle, as it tends to be windier in winter.)

The chart above shows that electricity generation from fossil fuels has halved since 2010, from 288TWh down to 142TWh in the most recent 12-month period.

Gas now contributes the vast majority of that shrinking total, as coal plants close down ahead of a planned phaseout in 2025. These ageing power stations were mostly built in the 1960s and 70s and are increasingly uneconomic to run due to CO2 prices, market forces and pollution rules.

In the third quarter of 2019, some 39% of UK electricity generation was from coal, oil and gas, including 38% from gas and less than 1% from coal and oil combined.

Another 40% came from renewables, including 20% from wind, 12% from biomass and 6% from solar. Nuclear contributed most of the remainder, generating 19% of the total.

While it is unlikely that renewables will generate more electricity than fossil fuels during the full year of 2019, it is now a question of when – rather than if – this further milestone will be passed.

This summer, National Grid predicted that zero-carbon sources of electricity – wind, nuclear, solar and hydro, but not biomass – would generate more electricity than fossil fuels during 2019. Carbon Brief’s analysis through to the third quarter of the year is in line with this forecast.

New capacity

Over the past year, the most significant reason for rising renewable generation has been an increase in capacity as new offshore windfarms have opened. The 1,200 megawatt (MW) Hornsea One project was completed in October, becoming the world’s largest offshore windfarm. The 588MW Beatrice offshore windfarm was completed in Q2 of this year.

These schemes add to the more than 2,100MW of offshore capacity that started operating during 2018. Further capacity is already being built, including the 714MW East Anglia One project that started generating electricity this year and will be completed in 2020.

In total, government contracts for offshore wind will take capacity from nearly 8,500MW today to around 20,000MW by the mid-2020s. The government and industry are jointly aiming for at least 30,000MW of offshore wind capacity by 2030, with two further contract auctions already expected.

In September, the latest auction round produced record-low deals for offshore windfarms that will generate electricity more cheaply than expected market prices – and potentially below the cost of running existing gas plants.

Other contributors to the recent increase in renewable generation include the opening of the 420MW Lynemouth biomass plant in Northumberland last year and the addition of hundreds of megawatts of new onshore wind and solar farms. (Another new 299MW biomass plant being built on Teesside, with a scheduled opening in early 2020, is facing “major delays”.)

According to the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), the rise in renewable output during the first half of 2019 was down to these increases in capacity, with weather conditions not unusual for the time of year.

Some two-thirds of electricity generated from biomass in the UK comes from “plant biomass”, primarily wood pellets burnt at Lynemouth and the Drax plant in Yorkshire. The remainder comes from an array of smaller sites based on landfill gas, sewage gas or anaerobic digestion.

The Committee on Climate Change says the UK should “move away” from large-scale biomass power plants, once existing subsidy contracts for Drax and Lynemouth expire in 2027.

Using biomass to generate electricity is not zero-carbon and in some circumstances could lead to higher emissions than from fossil fuels. Moreover, there are more valuable uses for the world’s limited supply of biomass feedstock, the CCC says, including carbon sequestration and hard-to-abate sectors with few alternatives.

In terms of fossil-fuel generating capacity, the UK’s remaining coal plants are rapidly closing down, well ahead of a 2025 deadline to phase out unabated burning of the fuel. By March 2020, just four coal plants will remain in the UK.

Utility firms have plans to build up to 30,000MW of new gas capacity – including 3,600MW at Drax recently given government planning approval – despite the fact that government projections suggest only around 6,000MW might be needed by 2035.

It is unlikely that all of the planned new gas capacity will get built. The schemes are generally reliant on winning contracts under the UK’s capacity market, which is designed to ensure electricity supply is always sufficient to meet demand.

The rise of renewables means that gas generation is likely to continue falling in the UK, whether or not this new capacity gets built. Nevertheless, the UK is unlikely to meet its legally binding goal of cutting overall emissions to net-zero by 2050, unless progress in the electricity sector is matched by reductions in other parts of the UK economy, such as heating and transport.

Consecutive months

Carbon Brief’s electricity-sector analysis shows that renewables are also estimated to have generated more electricity than fossil fuels during the individual months of August and September, the first time there have been two consecutive such months.

Previously, renewables beat fossil fuels in September 2018 – the first-ever whole month – and then again in March 2019. This means that there have only ever been four months where renewables outpaced fossil generation, of which three have been this year and two in the last two months.

This is shown in the chart, below, which also highlights the greater month-to-month variability in electricity generation and demand, which is overlaid on top of the broader seasonal cycles.

In the first three quarters of 2019, renewables outpaced fossil fuels on 103 of the 273 individual days, Carbon Brief analysis suggests. This is more than one-third of the days in the year so far and includes 40 of the 91 days in the third quarter of 2019.

(Although this is not a majority of days, the aggregate output during the quarter was higher for renewables. This is because their excess over fossil fuels was large on some days.)

As expected from the monthly aggregates in the chart, above, these days with higher renewable generation are concentrated in March and the third quarter of 2019, as shown in the chart, below.

The total of 103 days with higher renewable electricity generation than from fossil fuels in the first three quarters of the year is far in excess of the 67 such days by the same point in 2018.

This is shown in the chart, below, which also highlights the fact that there had never been any days with higher renewable generation until 2015.

There have already been nearly as many higher renewable days in the first three quarters of 2019, at 103, as there were in the whole of 2018, which saw 107 such days. There were only 58 such days in 2017, just 16 in 2016 and 12 in 2015. The first ever day when UK renewables generated more electricity than fossil fuels was 11 April 2015.

Methodology

The figures in the article are from Carbon Brief analysis of data from BEIS Energy Trends chapter 5 and chapter 6, as well as from BM Reports. The figures from BM Reports are for electricity supplied to the grid in Great Britain only and are adjusted to include Northern Ireland.

In Carbon Brief’s analysis, the BM Reports numbers are also adjusted to account for electricity used by power plants on site and for generation by plants not connected to the high-voltage national grid. This includes many onshore windfarms, as well as industrial gas combined heat and power plants and those burning landfill gas, waste or sewage gas.

By design, the Carbon Brief analysis is intended to align as closely as possible to the official government figures on electricity generated in the UK, reported in BEIS Energy Trends table 5.1. Briefly, the raw data for each fuel is adjusted with a multiplier, derived from the ratio between the reported BEIS numbers and unadjusted figures for previous quarters.

Carbon Brief’s method of analysis has been verified against published BEIS figures using “hindcasting”. This shows the estimates for total electricity generation from fossil fuels or renewables to have been within ±3% of the BEIS number in each quarter since Q4 2017. (Data before then is not sufficient to carry out the Carbon Brief analysis.)

For example, in the second quarter of 2019, a Carbon Brief hindcast estimates gas generation at 33.1TWh, whereas the published BEIS figure was 34.0TWh. Similarly, it produces an estimate of 27.4TWh for renewables, against a BEIS figure of 27.1TWh.

The Carbon Brief estimated totals for fossil fuels and renewables are very close in Q3 2019, coming within 0.5TWh of each other. This means that despite the relatively low level of uncertainty in the estimates, their relative position could be reversed in the official BEIS data.

This serves to emphasise the fact that the broader trend of decline for fossil fuels and an increase for renewables is of far greater significance than the precise figures for any individual quarter.

In contrast to Carbon Brief’s analysis, figures published by consultancy EnAppSys for the third quarter of 2019 suggest that fossil fuels generated slightly more electricity than renewables. There are several reasons for this difference.

First, the company’s analysis is for Great Britain only, whereas Carbon Brief’s covers the UK overall. Second, it reports on electricity “supplied” in the country, including imports, whereas Carbon Brief estimates the amount of electricity “generated” within the UK only.

Third, Carbon Brief’s analysis is, by design, aligned with the quarterly BEIS Energy Trends data for electricity generation, whereas EnAppSys uses its own approach.

For comparison, EnAppSys reported for the second quarter of 2019 that 28.3TWh was supplied in GB from gas, whereas BEIS reports that 34.0TWh was generated in the UK. Similarly EnAppSys reported 23.1TWh coming from renewables, against a BEIS figure of 27.1TWh.",https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-uk-renewables-generate-more-electricity-than-fossil-fuels-for-first-time
We Reported on a Nonprofit Hospital System That Sues Poor Patients. It Just Freed Thousands From Debt.,We Reported on a Nonprofit Hospital System That Sues Poor Patients. It Just Freed Thousands From Debt.,1.0,"ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they’re published. This article was produced in partnership with MLK50, which is a member of the ProPublica Local Reporting Network.

MEMPHIS, Tenn. — The city’s largest nonprofit hospital system has erased the debts owed by more than 6,500 patients it sued for unpaid hospital bills, less than two months after announcing an overhaul of its debt collection processes.

The dramatic shift was prompted by an MLK50-ProPublica investigation that revealed that Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare filed more than 8,300 debt lawsuits from 2014 through 2018, including against its own employees. Methodist had doggedly pursued low-income defendants who had little ability to pay, often garnishing their meager paychecks.

The single-page “case satisfied” notices filed by Methodist are coming into the Shelby County General Sessions Court faster than staff can process them. A court administrator estimated a backlog of about 4,500 Methodist notices waiting to be entered into the court’s system.

From July 30 through Tuesday, the court had logged more than 2,300 notices submitted by the hospital system that wiped away patients’ debts. That’s more than nine times the number of notices filed by Methodist in the first six months of 2019.

For now, it appears that Methodist is no longer using the courts as a collection agency, a practice that was roundly criticized by health care experts, some elected officials and members of the United Methodist Church, with which Methodist is affiliated. Since July 3, the hospital has not filed any new debt collection lawsuits or garnishment attempts.

Methodist’s turnaround elated defendants and consumer advocates.

Among the defendants who no longer owe is Carrie Barrett, a part-time Kroger employee featured in one of the MLK50-ProPublica articles. Barrett’s case began in July 2007, when a two-night stay at Methodist Bonheur Healthcare, where doctors performed a heart catherization, left her with a $12,019 bill. In 2010, Methodist sued her for more than $16,000, one-third of which was attorney’s fees.

Over the years, thanks to interest and court costs, Barrett’s debt climbed to more than $33,000. If she paid $100 per month as ordered by the court, she would be 90 by the time she paid it off.

Barrett said she received a call nearly two weeks ago from an administrator who said the hospital had reviewed her records. “He said, ‘The balance is zero. ... I said, ‘You don’t know how good that sounds to my ears.’”

Jessica Curtis, a senior adviser at Community Catalyst, a national advocacy organization, has followed other nonprofit hospitals that have been the subject of similar media reports.

“I was trying to remember when have I seen such a rapid switch,” Curtis said. “I don’t know that I’ve seen that before. The scale of what they are attempting to rectify is really commendable from what we’ve seen thus far.”

Because the case satisfied notices do not include the amount owed, the total dollar amount of debt Methodist forgave could not immediately be quantified.

Methodist did not answer questions about how much debt it had forgiven or how many additional cases it has yet to review.

""We are implementing the policies and practices we announced in July, and we have reached out individually to patients who currently have legal proceedings to provide information related to their specific situation,"" a hospital spokesperson said in a statement sent Tuesday evening.

The hospital said formal letters to the patients were sent last week, and patients with questions should call the hospital's billing department at 901–842–1260. No date has been set to resume court collections.

Nonprofit hospitals are generally exempt from local, state and federal taxes. In return, the federal government expects them to provide a significant community benefit, including charity care and financial assistance.

Methodist, which operates five hospitals in Shelby County, does provide some charity care — but experts faulted it for its aggressive collections practices in a city where nearly 1 in 4 residents live below the poverty line.

Its handling of poor patients began with a financial assistance policy that, unlike many of its peers around the country, all but ignored patients with any form of health insurance, no matter their out-of-pocket costs. If they were unable to afford their bills, patients then faced what experts said is rare: A licensed collection agency owned by the hospital.

Lawsuits followed. Finally, after the hospital won a judgment, it would repeatedly try to garnish patients’ wages, which it did in a far higher share of cases than other nonprofit hospitals in Memphis.

Methodist repeatedly refused to make its executives available for interviews, but it sent statements defending itself, noting how it is the only health care system that has hospitals in all four quadrants of Shelby County and that it provided more than $226 million in community benefit. It did not address why its financial assistance policy was less generous than those of its peers or why it garnished wages in a higher percentage of cases than other hospitals.

But on June 30, three days after the MLK50-ProPublica investigation was published, Methodist CEO Michael Ugwueke said in a column published in The Commercial Appeal that the hospital would spend the next 30 days reviewing its collections and financial assistance policies.

Days later, Methodist announced it would suspend court collection activities over unpaid hospital bills. In the weeks that followed, the hospital’s attorney, R. Alan Pritchard, dropped dozens of suits that had been on the court docket.

On July 30, the hospital announced wide-reaching reforms. “We were humbled to learn that while there’s so much good happening across our health system each day, we can and must do more,” Ugwueke said in a media conference call.

Under the new policy, financial assistance will be provided to patients earning up to 250% of the federal poverty line, or $53,325 for a family of three. The previous policy applied to uninsured patients with incomes up to 125% of the federal poverty line. Methodist said more than half of the population of greater Memphis would be eligible for assistance under the new policy.

The hospital also said it would no longer accept court-ordered interest on medical debt nor would it seek to collect attorney’s fees or court costs from patients.

And it said it would raise its minimum wage to $13.50 an hour by mid-September and to $15 an hour by January 2021. The lowest-paid employees made $10 an hour and about 18% of workers earned less than $15 an hour, the hospital reported in response to MLK50’s 2018 Living Wage Survey.

The pay increase signaled that Methodist took the issue seriously, Curtis said. “The inclusion of wages means someone has realized not just the symptom of the problem but the core root of the problem. This is a clearly promising start,” she said.

It’s unclear whether Methodist will resume suing patients for unpaid bills. And the hospital has not said how many additional “case satisfied notices” it could file. Plaintiffs cannot refile lawsuits after the case has been marked satisfied.

One of the defendants featured in the investigation was a Methodist housekeeper, who asked that her name not be used for fear that the hospital would fire her for talking to a reporter.

In 2017, Methodist sued her for the cost of hospital stays to treat chronic abdominal pain she experienced before the hospital hired her. She owed about $23,000, including around $5,800 in attorney’s fees.

In January, a General Sessions Court judge ordered her to pay $75 biweekly. The housekeeper paid reliably until this summer, when she missed several days of work because she was sick, eventually ending up in the hospital. That left her paycheck short.

She received a small annual raise in August, and another to $13.50 less than two weeks ago

Last week, a reporter showed the housekeeper a copy of her case satisfied notice.

“God is a good God,” she said, laughing and smiling. “I’ve been calling them and they tell me nothing. … This is a blessing right here.”

Barrett, the Kroger employee featured in the first MLK50-ProPublica story, likewise praised God. At church this month, Barrett had an update for the congregation, which had heard her speak about her financial troubles before.

“I have a zero balance,” she said. “I just want to thank God for blessings that he has brought to me. … I thank him for the victory!” she shouted, as others joined her in praise.

“Victory is ours, amen!” a minister said from the pulpit. “Don’t y’all know that Jesus will drop those charges? Glory to God!”

Commercial whaling may be over in Iceland,"Commercial whaling may be over in Iceland - Citing the pandemic, whale watching, and a lack of exports, one of the three largest whaling countries may be calling it quits.",1.0,"As public opinion changes and consumption of whale meat declines, commercial whaling may be one step closer to a permanent end in Iceland and possibly the world. For the second year in a row, Iceland, one of three remaining whaling nations, will not hunt any whales.

Iceland already harvested the lowest number of whales among the whaling holdouts, which include Japan and Norway. Since resuming whaling in 2003 after a 14-year pause, the island nation has killed 1,505 whales. Recent announcements by the country’s two whaling companies suggest that the annual hunt may be coming to an end. (Whales are worth millions of dollars in the fight against climate change. Here's why.)

Gunnar Bergmann Jonsson, managing director of the minke whaling company IP-Utgerd, told AFP on April 24, “I’m never going to hunt whales again, I’m stopping for good.”

On the same day, Kristján Loftsson, CEO of Hvalur, told the Icelandic newspaper Morgunbladid that his ships would not be setting out to sea this summer.

One reason, Loftsson said, was the social distancing restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, which would make crewing vessels and processing whales impractical. But Hvalur’s ships also stayed in port in 2019, and Loftsonn acknowledged that there were bigger issues at play. For one, his company hunts fin whales primarily for export to Japan, which has become a difficult market.

Last year, Japan ended 80 years of whaling in the Antarctic, withdrew from the International Whaling Commission (IWC), and shifted its focus to hunting whales in its own coastal waters and exclusive marine zone. The news was widely greeted with dismay by anti-whaling activists, while Japanese officials presented it as an act of defiance and principle.

The decision was more likely because consumption of whale meat in Japan has been falling for years. Per capita, the Japanese now eat only about an ounce a year , and as a consequence, approximately 4,000 tons of unsold whale meat is stored in a growing stockpile.

Loftsson told Morgunbladid that Japanese government subsidies keep local whalers afloat and make it impossible for his company to compete.

Requests for comment from Loftsson and Jonsson were not provided as of press time.

Another issue for Loftsson is that public opinion on whaling has changed, says Árni Finnsson, chairman of the Iceland Nature Conservation Association. “What has changed is that the fishing industry is not willing to support him anymore. They feel that Iceland needs to be able to export fish to the U.S. market, and they don’t want to continue defending whaling. I think he’s done.”

This change in attitude is seemingly a consequence of a dramatic shift in Iceland: Support for hunting whales has declined as the income derived from watching them has climbed.

Whale watching in Iceland is booming

Between 2012 and 2016, the number of people who went on whale watching trips in Iceland increased by between 15 and 34 percent annually, meaning that the yearly increase in whale watchers was greater than the number of people who went cetacean spotting in 2000.

In the northern coastal village of Hauganes (population: 137), the number of whale watching visitors rose from 4,000 in 2015 to 17,000 by 2018.

Whale watching trips that depart from the Icelandic capital of Reykjavik operate in the eastern part of a large body of water called Faxaflói Bay, which in recent years is also where minke whaling has taken place. In 2007, a small portion of the bay was set aside as a sanctuary to prevent whale watchers and whalers from descending on the same whales.

In November 2017, following a campaign by Icewhale, the country’s association of whale-watching companies, the government announced a significant expansion of that sanctuary. That effectively eliminated the whalers’ hunting grounds: Between 2007 and 2016, 321 of 335 minkes caught in Iceland were killed in an area now within the sanctuary’s new boundaries.

That loss of access also has coincided with a precipitous decline in domestic consumption of a food that, Finnsson says, wasn’t exactly looked at lovingly even during its heyday.

“When I was a kid in Akureyri in the north, minke whale meat was our ‘Wednesday meat,’ ” he recalls with a smile. “It was very cheap, and it was not the sort of thing a family would offer on Sundays. It was nothing good.”

By 2018, a Gallup poll conducted for the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) found that only one percent of Icelanders ate whale meat regularly, while 84 percent claimed never to have eaten it at all.

Much of the domestic market was increasingly geared toward foreign visitors, who were encouraged to sample it as a traditional delicacy. A campaign by IFAW and Icewhale, which sought to gently discourage tourists from eating whale meat, has caused consumption by visitors to fall by half since 2011.

The lack of enthusiasm for whale meat in Iceland is mirrored in Norway, where the number of whaling vessels dropped by almost half from 2016 to 2017. Among them, these remaining ships kill, process, and sell barely a third of the country’s official quota.

Iceland’s experience suggests that internal indifference and the rise of whale watching over whale killing could finally push global commercial whaling over the precipice.

“The last remaining whalers seem to be making an exit,” says Patrick Ramage, director of marine conservation for IFAW. “Hunting whales with cameras delivers economic benefits to coastal communities around the world, and Iceland is pointing the way.”",https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/04/commercial-whaling-may-be-over-iceland/

Colorado is on track to give teens three free therapy sessions to help them cope with coronavirus,Colorado is on track to give teens three free therapy sessions to help them cope with coronavirus,1.0,"Every Coloradan age 18 and younger would have access to a free mental health screening and as many as three free subsequent visits with a mental health professional under a new, bipartisan bill at the state Capitol aimed at helping kids deal with the effects of the coronavirus crisis.

House Bill 1258 represents one of the most aggressive behavioral health initiatives in Colorado history and would come with a one-time allocation of $9 million.

The measure calls for the creation of an online portal where children can fill out an assessment and then connect with providers if needed.

“We know that kids who are getting the support that they need are healthier and more successful at school,” said state Rep. Dafna Michaeson Jenet, a Commerce City Democrat who is a prime sponsor of the legislation. “If we can get that to every kid in Colorado? Game-changer.”

The measure expands on Michaelson Jenet’s idea, first reported by The Colorado Sun earlier this year, to check in with every Colorado student after a tumultuous, coronavirus-marred school year by offering them free mental health screening before the start of next academic year.

Rep. Dafna Michaelson Jenet, D-Commerce City, speaks about mental health parity to the audience at The Colorado Sun’s Big Ideas 2020 Forum at the Cable Center on the University of Denver campus on Jan. 14, 2020. (Eric Lubbers, The Colorado Sun)

In February, when she first floated the proposal, it was unclear if there would be enough money — or political willpower — to make it a reality.

But then Gov. Jared Polis’ administration offered a similar proposal, and two ideas joined in the form of House Bill 1258.

The legislation appears to be on a fast-track to passage. Its funding comes from an $800 million state coronavirus stimulus package that lawmakers are still unveiling, and which includes money for everything from infrastructure upgrades to restaurant tax relief to drought-resiliency programs. The bill is supported by Democratic leadership at the Capitol and has a Republican primer sponsor in Rep. Kevin Van Winkle, of Highlands Ranch.

The $9 million appropriated for House Bill 1258 would have to be spent by June 30, 2022, the end of the next fiscal year. The money would go to providers to reimburse them for their time.

This news first appeared in The Unaffiliated. Subscribe here to get the twice-weekly political newsletter from The Colorado Sun.

Michaelson Jenet hopes the mental health screenings can begin before the end of the current academic year. “If we are able to do that, that would be phenomenal,” she said.

Children’s Hospital Colorado says it has seen a sharp spike in mental health-related visits and the group Mental Health America says there has been an increase in kids reporting feeling lonely. Anecdotally, parents across Colorado have reported mental health issues among their children as they’ve been isolated from friends during the pandemic. A string of teen suicides on the Eastern Plains was blamed on coronavirus restrictions.

Sen. Janet Buckner, an Aurora Democrat, is also a prime sponsor of the bill. The former speech and language therapist said she thinks the legislation will have a big, lasting impact.

Proponents also see the measure as a school-safety initiative. Michaelson Jenet said asking kids to return to school without a mental-health check in is akin to putting students in a pressure cooker.

House Bill 1258 aims to ensure that kids who access mental health services don’t fall off the map after their three free visits with a provider. To allow for continuity of care, the legislation calls on the state to help connect kids with a therapist in their insurance network once their free visits are used up.

If there’s money available, kids may also be able to access more than three free visits.

At $9 million, the funding for House Bill 1258 is one of the more sizable pools of money set aside so far as part of the state coronavirus stimulus package. But Michaelson Jenet thinks it’s not too much.

“I’m worried that it won’t be enough,” she said. “In order for it to not be enough we need to do our job really well on the back end of this passing and make sure we get word-of-mouth (marketing) and communities involved and engaged. Quite frankly, I hope we run out of money and need to find more.”

People between 19 and 22 years old could also access free counseling under the bill if they are receiving special-education services.

The legislation has not yet been scheduled for its first committee hearing.",https://coloradosun.com/2021/04/08/free-mental-health-exam-kids-colorado/
"Endangered mountain gorilla population recovers to over 1,000","Endangered mountain gorilla population recovers to over 1,000",1.0,"GOMA, Congo (Reuters) - The population of mountain gorillas, one of the world’s most endangered species, which survives on the forest-cloaked volcanoes of central Africa, has increased by a quarter to over 1,000 individuals since 2010, wildlife authorities said.

That is despite the threat posed by poachers and armed groups in the Virunga Massif, a spine of volcanic mountains in the western Rift Valley straddling eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda and Rwanda, where most of them reside.

The latest census put them at 1,004 individuals: 604 in Virunga, and 400 in Uganda’s nearby Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Joel Wenga Malembe, spokesman for the Congolese Institute for the Conservation of Nature, told Reuters.

The last survey, in 2010, found just 786 of this critically endangered eastern gorilla sub-species, of which 480 were in Virunga.

“These numbers are truly remarkable, far exceeding our expectations, and are the result of a collaborative, three-country effort with governments and partners all playing an important role,” Mike Cranfield, of charity Gorilla Doctors, said in a statement.

Partly because they are so rare, the mountain gorillas are a major source of tourist revenue for the three nations, and their habitat supports other rare species found nowhere else such as golden monkeys.

But they are under constant threat of encroachment by farmers in one of Africa’s most densely populated rural regions, and hunting for bush meat or bizarre trophies sold abroad.

Congo has also invited oil companies to start drilling in Virunga, Africa’s largest tropical rainforest reserve, which conservationists worry will put the environment in greater danger.

Adding to Virunga’s woes, rangers banned tourists this month from entering the park during investigations into the kidnapping of two Britons by an armed militia.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-endangered-gorillas/endangered-mountain-gorilla-population-recovers-to-over-1000-idUSKCN1IX4NG
Utah Legalizes Lemonade Stands and Other Businesses Run by Kids,Utah Legalizes Lemonade Stands and Other Businesses Run by Kids,1.0,"Kids in Utah will no longer have to worry about the police shutting down their lemonade stands. Under a new state law (SB 81) that passed with overwhelming, bipartisan support, cities and counties cannot require a license or permit for any occasional business operated by a minor.

Lawmakers shouldn’t even have to enact this type of Ron Swanson-style common sense, and yet licensing laws have stymied kid entrepreneurs all across the country. Police in Overton, Texas once stopped Zoey and Andria Green (aged seven and eight) from selling lemonade, because the two girls didn’t have the proper permits. Eleven-year-old Madison Root couldn’t sell mistletoe at a holiday market in Portland, Oregon without a permit, though begging for money would have been allowed.

In New Jersey, Matt Molinari and Eric Schnepf went door to door, offering to shovel snow ahead of an incoming snowstorm. But police soon barred the two teens because they lacked a solicitation permit, which can cost $450 in some boroughs. Their story later inspired lawmakers to scrap the ban.

But in Utah, the ban on local licenses will shield young entrepreneurs from government crackdowns. SB 81 follows an earlier measure passed in Salt Lake County, the state’s most populous county. Four years prior, the county council approved a business ordinance that specifically singled out “lemonade stands and similar operations run by children” from needing a government permission slip. Thanks to SB 81, that type of exemption now applies throughout the entire state.

SB 81 also provides some regulatory relief for adults. The new law bans local licenses and excessive fees for home-based businesses that are operated occasionally in Utah. According to the bill’s sponsor, Sen. Jacob Anderegg, many local licensing fees create a “perverse incentive to raise money” for the government. A fiscal note for the bill estimates that the reform will save home-based businesses over $720,000 each year.

Still, many stringent licensing laws remain in force. A 2012 report by the Institute for Justice found that the Beehive State is the “12th most extensively and onerously licensed state.”",http://ij.org/utah-legalizes-lemonade-stands-businesses-run-kids/
Australia to plant 1 billion trees to help meet climate targets,Australia to plant 1 billion trees to help meet climate targets,1.0,"SYDNEY (BLOOMBERG) - Australia aims to plant a billion trees by 2050 as part of a new forestry plan the government says will help the country meet its Paris Agreement climate targets.

A sod-turning spree on that scale would contribute to the removal of 18 million tonnes of greenhouse gas per year by 2030 in a country currently producing in excess of 500 million tonnes of CO2-equivalent per year.

The Regional Forestry Hubs plan would also support jobs in a sector that contributes more than A$23 billion (S$22.3 billion) to the national economy, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said in a media statement.

Australia has the seventh-largest forested area in the world covering 17 per cent of its land area, according to the government's 2018 State of the Forests report.

Morrison has said Australia will comfortably meet its Paris-agreed goal to reduce carbon emissions by 26 to 28 per cent of 2005 levels by 2030, but has no specific policies in place to get there.

An OECD report last month said the country would miss the target unless it intensified its efforts to combat climate change.

The importance of coal to the Australian economy is an obstacle to serious efforts to lower carbon emissions, environmentalists say.

Gov. Inslee signs bill banning therapists from practicing gay conversion therapy,Washington State governor to sign bill banning therapists from practicing gay conversion therapy,1.0,"OLYMPIA, Wash. — Governor Jay Inslee signed a bill Wednesday to ban the practice known as conversion therapy in Washington state.

Danny Cords stepped into the state Capitol on Wednesday, a survivor of conversion therapy he wants to ban.

“Yes, absolutely,” it was akin to torture, he said. “Snapping a rubber band on my wrist, putting a rock in my shoe so I could always be thinking of Christ and not everything else that was going on in my brain because of biology.”

Cords was there as the governor signed a new law prohibiting licensed therapists from performing conversion therapy on anyone under the age of 18.

“We know the scars caused by conversion therapy need to end today in the State of Washington,” Gov. Jay Inslee said.

The new law prohibits any regime to change the sexual orientation or gender identity, to change behavior or gender expressions, or to eliminate same-sex attraction. However, the law doesn't cover non-licensed or religious counselors.

When Seattle passed a similar law, critics objected.

“If they could basically attack the parents, they would. So, they are coming in the back door, trying to make it look like the issue is about therapists. It's not,” said Kevin Amos.

Asked why this should not be a decision for parents, the governor responded, “Because we don’t let parents or doctors make decisions to let broken legs be treated in something that ends up losing both your limbs. It's unprofessional, it's damaging, it is not scientifically credible and it violates not only our values, but the mental health of kids with decades of depression ahead of them if they are told to hate themselves.”

Danny Cords tried suicide.

“I tried to end it, I didn't have a point to living, because that's what I had been told since I was 14.”

Those gathered for Wednesday's celebration say more needs to be done.

“It's a shame that we've gone this far in 2018 and haven’t outlawed this therapy nationally,” Cords said.

INDEPENDENCE, Mo. — In this season of giving thanks, one student shows what generosity is all about. When one young lady from Missouri found a financial windfall, she gave it to others in need, overlooking her own needs.

7-year-old Phoebe Brown says she knew exactly what she’d found, and how best to use it. The second grade student from Sycamore Hills Elementary School in Independence was shopping with her mother at the Hy-Vee store on U.S. Highway 40 on November 9th when she found a winning lottery ticket on the floor inside the store.

The Brown family says Phoebe often picks up discarded lottery tickets. They were already at a gas station down the street when she realized she’d found a winner.

“She’s like, ‘Mom, Mom, it’s a winner!’ I said, ‘No it’s not’,” Audrey Brown, Phoebe’s mother, said. “It was. It was a $100 winner.”

The numbers were already scratched off that Missouri Lottery ticket, which bore the logo of the Missouri Tigers, and Phoebe knew a winner when she saw one.

“I saw that lottery ticket and it had a two on the back. I thought I’d better pick it up, and I told my mom it was a winner,” Phoebe told FOX 4 News.

“Everything went through my mind. What could we do with it? What could Phoebe do with it?” Audrey Brown said.

Rather than to spend it on herself, young Phoebe decided to help others.

Sycamore Hills Elementary School has been collecting canned goods for the less-fortunate, as part of the Independence School District’s 150th anniversary. Phoebe decided to donate the money to feed others. School district leaders say the Browns bought $100 worth of groceries at a local store to add to the room filled with donations.

“There have been times where I’ve been out of work, and we had nowhere to stay and our family’s taken us in, and helped us out. We’re thankful for our friends and our family,” Joshua Brown, Phoebe’s dad, said.

And as a promise, the school’s gym teacher, Herb Horseman, allowed the entire second grade to shave his long, bushy beard – Phoebe’s donation helped them win that prize.

”You’re welcome and I hope you have a happy Thanksgiving,” Phoebe said.

Phoebe told FOX 4 News her parents also taught her to be thoughtful and kind to others. Her contribution at the holiday season will go toward providing meals for families who couldn’t otherwise afford to celebrate Thanksgiving.

All told, the Sycamore Hills kids collected over 1,700 canned goods and household items. Second graders at the school accounted for 541 of those donations. School officials say they’ll all go to help less fortunate families within the Independence School District.",http://fox2now.com/2016/11/23/girl-spots-discarded-winning-lottery-scratcher-spends-money-on-thanksgiving-for-those-in-need/
World's biggest fund manager issues 'Darth Vader-style' threat to oust bosses who ignore climate change,World's biggest fund manager threatens to oust company directors who ignore climate change,1.0,"The world’s biggest fund manager has threatened to vote out directors of companies that fail to address the risks posed to their businesses by climate change.

In a post on its website, BlackRock, which controls assets worth $5.1 trillion (about £4.2 trillion), said climate risk was a “systemic issue”.

It said it planned to engage with the companies that are “most exposed to climate risk” over this year to help them tell investors – like BlackRock -- about the financial impacts of global warming and the shift to a low-carbon economy.

In an associated briefing note, BlackRock made clear how serious it was about the issue, pointing to a letter written to businesses by its chief executive Larry Fink which had said “while we are patient investors, we are not infinitely patient”.

“Climate risk will be one of the key engagement themes that the Investment Stewardship team will prioritize in 2017 and the team’s recent work on this issue … will inform our assessment of shareholder proposals on the topic,” the briefing note said.

“Over the course of 2017 we intend to engage companies most exposed to climate risk to understand their views on [reporting their climate risks].

“For directors of companies in sectors that are significantly exposed to climate risk, the expectation will be for the whole board to have demonstrable fluency in how climate risk affects the business and management’s approach to adapting and mitigating the risk.”

​BlackRock said it would vote in favour of proposals on climate risk that “clearly address a gap” which would otherwise lead to “material economic disadvantage to the company and its shareholders”.

And, if this was not enough, it promised to use its power to get rid of directors who were part of the problem.

“Ultimately the board is responsible for protecting the long-term economic interests of shareholders and we may vote against the re-election of certain directors where we believe they have not fulfilled that duty, particularly in markets where shareholder proposals are not common,” BlackRock said.

Reacting to BlackRock’s new guidance, Boston-based lawyer Seth Jaffe wrote a blog post called “Investors don’t think that climate change is a hoax: BlackRock is losing its patience” – referring to Donald Trump’s infamous claim that global warming was made up by China.

He highlighted Mr Fink’s comment that BlackRock was not “infinitely patient”.

“I’m picturing James Earl Jones as Darth Vader saying that,” Mr Jaffe said. “I wonder what energy executives are hearing.”

This was the first time a major fossil fuel company had admitted climate change and the world's response to it poses a material risk to its finances.

The Financial Times reported the switch to electric vehicles and low-carbon sources of fuel and energy was raising the prospect of ""peak demand"" for oil being reached within the next decade.

Relative of kidney recipient calls Humboldt Broncos player Logan Boulet a hero,"Logan Boulet of the Humboldt Broncos helped save six lives through donated organs this weekend, and inspired thousands of Canadians to become organ donors. Organ donor registration this weekend 6x higher than normal in British Columbia, 3x in Ontario, 2x in Alberta.",1.0,"Many social media users say the donation of Humboldt Broncos player Logan Boulet’s organs has not only potentially saved lives, but inspired them to have the conversation with loved ones and become donors themselves.

And one Twitter user called Boulet a hero, noting one of his kidneys went to her aunt.

“This man is a hero in our family,” posted Brittany B. “Thank you to Logan Boulet and his family for the gift of organ donation. He is my aunties (sic) angel. Last night she had a successful kidney transplant. So much gratitude.”

Boulet, a 21-year-old defenceman from Lethbridge, was among the 15 people killed in a horrific crash involving the junior hockey team in Saskatchewan. Fourteen others were injured when the team’s bus and a transport truck collided Friday in a tragedy that has reverberated around the world.

Boulet’s cousin Julie Kindt said on Facebook that Boulet had been on life support until his organs could be donated.

His godfather posted a statement on behalf of the family saying a surgical team from Alberta travelled to a Saskatoon hospital to conduct organ transplant procedures early Sunday morning. Neil Langevin said six people were set to receive the “gift of life” from Boulet, and his other organs would be donated to science.

“Logan had made it known, and very clear to his family, that he had signed his organ donor card when he turned 21 just a few weeks ago,” Langevin said in a Facebook post that had been shared more than 1,700 times as of Monday morning. “These actions alone give voice to the selfless and benevolent nature Logan possessed in life for others.”

About 4,600 people across Canada are on a waiting list for a life-saving organ transplant, according to Joyce Van Deurzen, executive director of the Kidney Foundation of Canada’s Saskatchewan and southern Alberta branches.

“There’s no doubt that the need is far greater than the number of organs available for transplant, so every donor, every organ is so precious,” Van Deurzen said. “This young man has saved the lives of many people so hopefully his family can take some measure of comfort in that. They really are granting his last wish by deciding to donate his organs in agreement with his wishes.”

Since the weekend, there’s been a “significant increase” in the number of people who have registered to become organ or tissue donors in the province, according to a spokesman for Alberta Health Minister Sarah Hoffman.

Close to 900 people registered on Sunday and Monday, compared to an average of 425 registrations that typically occur on a typical Sunday/Monday registration period.

A total of 462,861 people are currently registered across the province. The government said in a statement that each donor can potentially save up to eight lives through organ donation, or help as many as 75 people through tissue donation.

More than 3,000 lives in Alberta have been saved through organ donation in the past decade, it stated. Since the province launched the Alberta Organ and Tissue Donation Registry in 2014, about 10 per cent of Albertans have registered to become organ and tissue donors.

Boulet’s final act of generosity has been met with an outpouring of support on social media.

“Never thought a junior hockey player in Saskatchewan named Logan Boulet would motivate me to finally become an organ donor,” Jeff Vallance, of southern Alberta, posted on Twitter. “He saved 6 lives. Took 4 minutes. You can do it as well.”

Ontario’s organ donation agency says it saw online registrations nearly triple Sunday compared to two weeks prior.

“Logan Boulet, you inspired me. I became an organ donor today,” posted Ottawa mom Julie Cote.

A Tallahassee judge ruled Wednesday that a Tampa cancer patient can legally grow his own marijuana.The Tampa Bay Times reports that strip club owner Joe Redner will be allowed to grow and harvest cannabis ""for the purpose of his emulsifying the biomass he needs for the juicing protocol recommended by his physician."" The ruling only applies to Redner, a 77-year-old vegan with stage 4 lung cancer – no other medical marijuana patients would qualify under this order.Redner sued the Florida Department of Health after the agency said that under state law, registered medical marijuana patients were not allowed to grow their own cannabis.""Florida law only allows the licensed dispensing organizations to grow, process and dispense marijuana,"" the health department states on its website . ""The department will refer any business or individual suspected of violating state law to local law enforcement for investigation.""But Redner argued he was entitled to grow his own medical marijuana because he needs the raw plant for the treatment his state-certified doctor has prescribed him. Medical cannabis dispensaries across the state do not provide this product. Leon County Circuit Judge Karen Gievers said the state Health Department's Office of Medical Marijuana Use was being ""non-compliant"" with the requirements set by voters who approved Amendment 2 for expanded medical marijuana use in Florida.""The Court finds that Florida's Constitution provides Mr. Redner's right to grow his own medical marijuana so he can follow his physician's recommendation,"" Gievers wrote in her ruling . ""Until and unless the [Florida Department of Health] stops violating its Constitutional duty and adopts the mandated presumptive regulation, the evidence clearly demonstrates that Mr. Redner is entitled to follow the recommendations of his certified physician.""The Times reports Florida Department of Health will probably appeal the judge's ruling, which could block Redner from immediately growing medical cannabis.",https://www.orlandoweekly.com/Blogs/archives/2018/04/11/florida-judge-rules-tampa-cancer-patient-can-grow-his-own-marijuana

Animal welfare groups, marine scientists, politicians, and millions of Canadians celebrate historic win for marine animals



OTTAWA , June 10, 2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Canada has passed legislation that bans keeping whales, dolphins and porpoises in captivity for entertainment, as well as the trade, possession, capture and breeding of cetaceans. Today, the House of Commons voted overwhelmingly in favour of Bill S-203, the Ending the Captivity of Whales and Dolphins Act.

Bill S-203 was introduced by Senator Wilfred Moore in 2015, and then sponsored by Senator Murray Sinclair. Upon passage through the Senate, it was championed by Green Party Leader Elizabeth May in the House of Commons.

Rebecca Aldworth, Executive Director of HSI/Canada stated: “The passage of Bill S-203 is a watershed moment in the protection of marine animals and a victory for all Canadians. Whales and dolphins don’t belong in tanks, and the inherent suffering these highly social and intelligent animals endure in intensive confinement can no longer be tolerated. We congratulate the sponsors of this bill and the Canadian government for showing strong leadership in responding to public will and sound science on this critical issue.”

Green Party Leader and Saanich – Gulf Islands MP Elizabeth May stated, ""Canadians have been clear, they want the cruel practice of keeping whales and dolphins in captivity to end. With the passage of Bill S-203, we have ensured that this will happen.""

Bill sponsor Senator Wilfred Moore said, ""We have a moral obligation to phase out the capture and retention of animals for profit and entertainment. Canadians are calling upon us to do better – and we have listened.”

Leading marine scientist Hal Whitehead added, “The living conditions for captive marine mammals cannot compare to their natural ocean environments in size, nor in quality. We thank the federal government and all those involved in the passage of Bill S-203, so that our laws can finally align with the Canadian peoples’ values and end this cruel practice.”

HSI is at the forefront of a global movement to end the captivity of cetaceans for entertainment. HSI/Canada has been a central part of a broad coalition of key stakeholders, including organizations, scientists and parliamentarians, working to ensure the passage of Bill S-203.

Facts:

A coalition of over 20 leading marine scientists and stakeholder organizations have endorsed Bill S-203. Bill S-203 was supported by Humane Society International/Canada, Animal Justice, Humane Canada, marine scientists Dr. Lori Marino and Dr. Naomi Rose of the Whale Sanctuary Project, Ontario Captive Animal Watch, Phil Demers, the former head trainer at Marineland, World Animal Protection, Dr. David Suzuki, the Jane Goodall Institute, and more.

Bill S-203 phases out the captivity of cetaceans (i.e. whales, dolphins and porpoises) in Canada, except for rescues, rehabilitation, licensed scientiﬁc research, or cetaceans’ best interests.

Leading marine scientists agree that whales and dolphins suffer great psychological and physical harms in captivity, including isolation, chronic health problems, abnormal behaviour, high infant mortality and extreme boredom.

Currently, only two facilities in the country house cetaceans – the Vancouver Aquarium, and Marineland in Niagara Falls. Now, these facilities will no longer be able to breed or import any new cetaceans into their facilities.

We thank the key Parliamentarians and staffers who championed and sponsored this legislation: MP Elizabeth May, Senator Wilfred Moore, Senator Murray Sinclair, MP Fin Donnelly, MP Gord Johns, Senator Peter Harder, Senator Dan Christmas, MP Nathan Cullen, MP Sean Casey, MP Nathaniel Erskine-Smith, MP Mario Beaulieu, MP Monique Pauzé, MP Nick Whalen, MP Will Amos, Senator Elizabeth Hubley, Senator Janis Johnson, Senator Mary Jane McCallum, Steve Parkinson, Martin McKendry, Archie Campbell, and many more.

Dog saves owner’s life by lying on him for nearly 24 hours in freezing conditions,"Dog saves owner’s life by lying on him for nearly 24 hours in freezing conditions: 'I think animals can help and his dog really kept him alive and really helped him, he was very fortunate,' says doctor",1.0,"A man who broke his neck outdoors in freezing conditions survived lying in snow for nearly 24 hours thanks to his dog, who kept him warm through the night and barked for help.

The Michigan man, named only as Bob, was alone when he left his farmhouse on New Year’s Eve to collect firewood.

Anticipating a journey of only several metres, Bob was wearing just long johns, a shirt and slippers when he went outside, despite the temperature being around -4C.

However, he slipped and broke his neck.

“I was screaming for help but my nearest neighbour is about a quarter mile away and it was 10.30 pm, but my Kelsey came,” said Bob.

Kelsey is Bob’s five-year-old Golden Retriever. She kept Bob warm by lying on top of top of him, and kept him awake by licking his hands and face.

Bob said: “She kept barking for help but never left my side. She kept me warm and alert. I knew I had to persevere through this and that it was my choice to stay alive.

“By morning my voice was gone and I couldn’t yell for help, but Kelsey didn’t stop barking.

“She was letting out this screeching howl that alerted my neighbour. He found me at 6:30 p.m. on New Year’s Day.”

Bob’s neighbour eventually discovered him after hearing Kelsey’s howls and called the emergency services. When Bob arrived in hospital, his core temperature was below 21C. Normal body temperature is 37C and hypothermia occurs when the body drops below 35C.

“I was surprised to find out that I didn’t have any frost bite,” said Bob, “I am sure it was because of Kelsey’s determination to keep me warm and safe.”

And to the surprise of doctors, Bob made a quick initial recovery from his neck injury.

“After the surgery, miraculously, he started to move his extremities with greater strength,” said Chaim Colen, MD, Neurosurgeon at McLaren Northern Michigan Hospital.

“Most people with spinal cord injuries, they don’t move,” Dr Colen told Petoskey News. “It’s tragic and when it’s done, it’s done. I don’t know if it was the cold temperatures that may have helped him or the fact he was laying down on the snow the way he was.”

He added: “I think animals can help and his dog really kept him alive and really helped him, he was very fortunate.”

However, Bob will still need to undergo extensive physiotherapy to regain his old strength and proper use of his limbs. However, he is expected to recover.

“I am so thankful for my two heroes,” Bob said. “Kelsey kept me warm, alert, and never stopped barking for help. Dr Colen saved my life and ability to move. They are truly heroes and I will be eternally grateful.”",http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/dog-saves-owners-life-snow-freezing-conditions-neck-broken-barks-help-mclaren-northern-michigan-a7526646.html
Mexican bakers make pan dulce for hundreds of Harvey victims after becoming trapped by floods,Trapped Mexican bakers make 'pan dulce' bread for hundreds of Harvey victims,1.0,"Four bakers who became trapped in their bakery for two days in the wake of Hurricane Harvey made hundreds of loaves of bread to give to flood victims.

The workers from the El Bolillo Bakery in Houston, Texas, used up nearly 2,000kg of flour to bake bread and pan dulce, Mexican sweet bread, throughout the night and day after they were left stranded by the floods over the weekend.

The four bakers had been working on a late shift when they realised they could not leave the shop because of the level of water on the streets.

To take their minds off worrying about their family and friends, they decided to continue to bake for those affected by the devastating downpours.

The Mexican bakery, which specialises in Mexican cakes and patisseries, had remained dry and had not been cut off from electricity so the bakers were able to work throughout the night and the following day.

Brian Alvarado, the manager of the shop on South Wayside Drive, told The Independent: ""When they realised they were stuck, they decided to keep themselves busy and help the community and made as many loaves of bread as they could.

""By the time the owner managed to get to them, they had made so much bread that we took the loaves to loads of emergency centres across the city for people affected by the floods.

""We didn't count exactly how many loaves they made, but they used 4,400 pounds [1,996kg] of flour.""

"When your dog's day is over it dreams of you, says Harvard psychologist","When your dog's day is over it dreams of you, says Harvard psychologist",1.0,"Dogs probably dream about their owners while they sleep, an expert has said.

Dr Deirdre Barrett, a Clinical and Evolutionary Psychologist at Harvard Medical School, has spent years studying sleep behaviour in humans.

Extrapolating from her work with people, she said it is likely dogs dream about their everyday experiences, just like humans.

✕ This collar shows if your dog is sad

“Humans dream about the same things they’re interested in by day, though more visually and less logically,” Dr Barrett told People.

“There’s no reason to think animals are any different. Since dogs are generally extremely attached to their human owners, it’s likely your dog is dreaming of your face, your smell and of pleasing or annoying you.”

She cautioned there is no way to know for sure what dogs see when they dream, or even if they dream at all, but said most mammals have a similar sleep cycle to humans, going into a deep sleep stage, in which the brain is much less active, and then into periods of activity called Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep, in which dreams occur for humans. ""That certainly makes it the best guess that other mammals are dreaming, too,"" she said.

But while dogs dote on their human companions, cats maintain their waking aloofness when they sleep.

“We actually know more about cats dreams, because one of the earliest sleep researchers, Michel Jouvet, destroyed the tiny area in cat brains that inhibits movements during REM sleep,"" Dr Barrett said. ""Cats lay quietly through the other stages of sleep, and when REM began, they leapt up, stalked, pounced, arched their backs and hissed. They looked like they were hunting mice in their dreams.”

✕ Cats are better than dogs

Dr Barrett confirmed that dogs too are probably acting out their dreams when their legs move in running motion in their sleep.

The psychologist also offered advice to pet owners who want to make sure their animals have good dreams.

She said: “The best way to give ourselves or our children better dreams is to have happy daytime experiences and to get plenty of sleep in a safe and comfortable environment. It’s a good bet this is also best for pets’ dreams.”",http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/dog-dreaming-about-you-owners-psychologist-harvard-a7373571.html
"Metallica Donate $100,000 to California Wildfire Relief Efforts","Metallica Donate $100,000 to California Wildfire Relief Efforts",1.0,"Metallica announced Friday that the band, through their All Within My Hands foundation, had donated $100,000 toward wildfire relief efforts in California. The heavy metal legends also encouraged fans to “support those in need and first responders.”

“Sadly once again communities in California are experiencing historically devastating wild fires in both the Northern and Southern parts of the state,” Metallica’s foundation wrote in a statement Friday.

“All Within My Hands has made a $50,000 donation each to the North Valley Community Foundation and the Los Angeles Fire Department Foundation; both agencies provide service to victims at evacuation centers and other much needed relief.”

Metallica continued, “We would like to encourage you to join us in supporting those in need and our first responders in any way you can by donating money, non-perishable food, clothing and other supplies or by giving your time volunteering or providing temporary housing. Every little bit helps.”

The rash of wildfires in northern and southern California have so far killed at least 63 people and scorched hundreds of thousands of acres of land. According to CNN, over 600 people are still missing in the aftermath of the still-burning blazes. The Camp Fire in northern California is the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California history.

Additionally, Metallica shared a video of their live, acoustic performance of “All Within My Hands” from their recent All Within My Hands Foundation Helping Hands benefit concert at San Francisco’s The Masonic on November 3rd.

Police chief gives opioid addicts HOPE,Police chief offers opioid addicts help without fear of arrest,1.0,"Nashville, North Carolina (CNN) He's only 24 years old, but he struggled with addiction for more than a decade. Thomas Spikes now owes his sobriety to none other than the chief of police in this small eastern North Carolina town.

""He saved my life for sure,"" he said. ""I owe a lot to him and the program.""

Thomas Spikes credits the police with saving his life and putting him on the road to recovery from his opioid addiction.

That program, called the HOPE initiative, is a collaboration between Nashville's town manager, Hank Raper, and Chief Thomas Bashore. As deaths from opioids continue to dramatically rise across America, topping the list for unintentional deaths at a higher rate than car accidents, North Carolina saw more than a 340% increase from 2010 to 2016.

""There's no clear characteristic of what a heroin or opioid addiction looks like. It's not a white problem, it's not a black problem, it's not a Hispanic problem, middle class, working class, upper class. It affects all peoples of all walks of life,"" Raper said.

So, the conversation began on how this small town of 5,400, where everyone knows their neighbors, could get ahead of the problem. The HOPE initiative, modeled after the innovative ""Angel"" program in Gloucester, Massachusetts , which opens the way for addicts to get police assistance and medical help without fear of arrest, is a way of rethinking law enforcement's role in responding to this growing epidemic.

""They walk into the front door, if they have drugs or paraphernalia on them at any time, they can turn it in to us at that time, and have no charges filed. And we facilitate them into recovery,"" Bashore said.

Drugs, but no arrest

So far the department has seen paraphernalia, syringes, cookers, pipes and injection ""rigs"" turned in. ""We have actually had individuals who have brought in heroin bags and turned that over because they knew that they were going to get into recovery and they didn't want that around when they got out,"" Bashore said.

Possession of heroin in North Carolina is a felony charge and having paraphernalia is a misdemeanor. Bashore and Raper met with the county's district attorney to ensure he was on board with not charging people. He was in full support.

HOPE, which is not an acronym but the town's offer of help in capital letters, kicked off on February 9, 2016. Eight days into the program, the first addict came into the police department.

""It was eye-opening, recalled Bashore. ""That individual came in and we spent the better part of 7½ hours getting him processed. Only then did I leave the hospital and come back to the police department to start calling facilities to start having him placed, after he left detox. You can spend hours on the phone, calling facilities, saying, ""Do you have a bed?""

Chief escorts addicts to detox

Bashore has driven many of the 172 men and women of HOPE to a detox facility himself. He has built personal relationships with several rehabilitation facilities across the state that now alert him when there is space available. And the business card he passes out has his personal cellphone number.

Nashville, North Carolina Chief of Police Thomas Bashore saw the increase in opioid deaths in his town and new he had to do something about it so he started a program called the HOPE initiative in which addicts can turn themselves into police with their drugs and paraphernalia. Rather than face arrest, they get help getting into a program to fight addiction.

""My cellphone, it rings all the time. Each participant who comes through the program and all their family members have it. So, when they need something, they reach out,"" Bashore said.

HOPE has created a positive result between the police and the community. Bashore said he wants people to understand that substance abuse is a disease and the police department's intention is to be ""supportive not only for their benefit, but for the community benefit.""

Nashville, North Carolina, a town of 5400 offers an unique program to help opioid addicts recover. Addicts can turn themselves into police with their drugs and paraphernalia. Rather than face arrest, they get help getting into a program to fight addiction.

Since the program began, Bashore said, crime is down 40% in the town, about 45 miles northeast of Raleigh. ""We've had a pretty significant drop in our crimes that are associated with substance-abuse disorder. Things like shoplifting and larcenies and breaking into cars.""

HOPE is not limited to residents of Nashville. People from all over the state have walked through the police station doors, as well as people from California and Pennsylvania.

The program comes at no cost to the participants. It is funded through small grants, fundraisers and donations.

""The chief paid for the first two months that I was there and the rehab I was at,"" recalled Spikes. Four months removed from rehab, he is now sober after being involved with drugs and alcohol for more than half his life.

Unlikely friendship

Spikes told CNN he first used drugs when he was 12 years old. ""It started off with just smoking weed,"" he said, ""then occasional pills, and it progressed through the years."" His addiction became a $200 to $300 a day habit at its worst.

Heroin became his drug of choice. He was caught with it in October 2016 and sent to jail. His arrest led to his first encounter with Bashore.

Spikes was skeptical of police and their offer to help. ""You don't talk to cops, you don't associate with them, they're not your friends,"" he said.

That changed quickly. Spikes said he recognized Bashore was solely there to help him, no questions asked. The chief ""never tried to pry into anything in my life in that era,"" Spikes said, ""(He doesn't) care who you hang out with, what kind of drugs you do.""

Spikes has cycled through countless rehab facilities, but said his life made a complete turnaround because of the chief and the HOPE initiative. ""He saved my life for sure because if it wasn't for the HOPE Initiative, I wouldn't have gotten help.""

As he hops back on the tiller in the hot summer sun, he smiles and says, ""My life has done a 180. I'm working, I have a vehicle, a house, I have a beautiful girlfriend with a baby on the way.""

And as for Bashore, he lives up to the name of his program. He hopes to continue to battle the opioid epidemic in his town, one addict at a time.

""Of those 172 people that have come through the program, I've actually been to two funerals. Knowing what the alternative could have been for Thomas ... (who) just recently disclosed to me that his girlfriend's pregnant, he's going to be a father,"" he said. ""So, that's an amazing thing. That touches me deeply.""",http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/23/health/north-carolina-police-help-opioid-addicts/index.html
"Oregon law to decriminalize all drugs goes into effect, offering addicts rehab instead of prison","Oregon law to decriminalize all drugs goes into effect, offering addicts rehab instead of prison",1.0,"PORTLAND, Ore. – For Janie Gullickson, rock bottom came both slowly and all at once.

A longtime drug and alcohol addict, Gullickson pushes back on the idea that one terrible day on the street leads to an epiphany and a climb back to normalcy. That’s what happens in movies, not real life.

“I lived in the bottom for years,” says Gullickson, 52. “For me and people like me, I laid there and wallowed in it for a long time.”

But if she has to pick the lowest point – one that lasted years, not days, she says – it came shortly after she hit 30 in 1998. At that time, Gullickson had five kids, ages 5 to 11, by four different men. She came home from work one day as a locksmith to find that her ex-husband had taken her two youngest and left the state. Horrified, devastated and convinced that this was the beginning of the end, her life spiraled: She dropped her other son off with his dad, left her two daughters with her mom and soon became an IV meth user.

In prison six years later, Gullickson was contemplating joining an intensive recovery program when a “striking, magnetic gorgeous Black woman walked in the room, held up a mug shot and started talking about being in the very chairs where we were sitting,” Gullickson remembers. There was life on the other side of addiction and prison, the woman said. But you have to fight for it. Gullickson believed her.

“I remember thinking, I may not be able to do all that, be what she was, but maybe I could do something different than this,” Gullickson says. “That day, I felt the door open to change and healing.”

Now Gullickson, executive director of the Mental Health & Addiction Association of Oregon, is determined to give other addicts the same opportunity. That’s why she pushed for the passage of Measure 110, first-of-its-kind legislation that decriminalizes the possession of all illegal drugs in Oregon, including heroin, cocaine, meth and oxycodone. Instead of a criminal-justice-based approach, the state will pivot to a health-care-based approach, offering addicts treatment instead of prison time. Those in possession will be fined $100, a citation that will be dropped if they agree to a health assessment.

The law goes into effect Monday and will be implemented over the next decade by the state officials at the Oregon Health Authority.

Advocates say the pivot will be life-changing for thousands of Oregonians.

“One of the things people misunderstand is how criminalization creates barriers to treatment,” says Kassandra Frederique, the executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, a national nonprofit dedicated to legalizing illicit drug use. “If we want people to make different choices, we have to give them more options ... ending criminalization will do leaps and bounds around ending shame, which automatically opens people up for other opportunities.”

Nationally, others are hopeful this could be the first in a wave of progressive measures that undo years of damage caused by drug criminalization, which disproportionately imprisoned people of color across the U.S.

“I hope that we all become more enlightened across this country that substance abuse is not something that necessitates incarceration, but speaks to other social ills – lack of health care, lack of treatment, things of that nature,” says Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman, D-N.J., an outspoken critic of the War on Drugs. “If you’re white and wealthy, you get an opportunity to get a break, go home to your family and go into some kind of health care environment.”

But it's often different for people of color, Watson Coleman says. According to the Drug Policy Alliance, prosecutors are “twice as likely to pursue a mandatory minimum sentence for Black people as for white people charged with the same offense.” And many people of color do time for possession alone: In 2016, there were more than 1.5 million drug arrests. More than 80% were for possession only.

Watson Coleman also points out that it’s far more expensive to pay to incarcerate someone than get them treatment. Rehab programs not only empower people, she says, but they also save communities money.

In early 2020, the Oregon Health Authority announced a 10-year plan to limit health inequities across the state. Measure 110 will be a crucial step in that fight, says Steve Allen, the behavioral health director at the authority OHA.

Helping addicts fight addiction means more than just straight drug rehab, he says – addiction is rarely an isolated event, as people struggling with it are typically juggling other crises including mental illness, physical or dental health care issues, and homelessness. Too many people spend too much of their lives cycling in and out of jails and emergency departments, Allen says, instead of getting the wraparound services they need. A move to take care of the whole individual will pay huge dividends.

“What we know is that punishment for addiction doesn’t work, and doesn’t improve outcomes for people,” Allen says. He points out that the law is going into effect at a critical time: Since the COVID-19 pandemic started in spring 2020, overdoses in Oregon have skyrocketed by 70%.

The program will be paid for by redistributing existing marijuana dollars that come from the state’s cannabis tax, which Allen calls “a huge advantage” because it likely won’t be dependent on whims of the local economy (marijuana funds have gone up recently, he noted).

Advocates hope other states will follow

Gullickson, who has been sober since 2008 after a few detours, already sees a shift nationally in the conversation around addiction.

She points to the October 2020 presidential debate, when then-Democratic nominee Joe Biden said, “No one should be going to jail because they have a drug problem” and expressed support for drug diversion programs. Having Biden in the White House now “makes a huge difference” Gullickson says.

Frederique at the Drug Policy Alliance agrees and says the Biden administration’s promise to bring science back to the White House will play an important role going forward.

“We need to ground our policies in science instead of stigma and punishment,"" Frederique says.

Undoing Trump's policies:What Biden did in his first week as president

In 2018, as the House studied and voted on bills aimed at helping solve America’s opioid crisis, Watson Coleman introduced her own legislation that called for Congress to formally apologize for the war on drugs and acknowledge the damage it had done to communities of color. It also called for future drug policy to be ground in “evidence-based health care solutions.”

The war on drugs, Watson Coleman says, “was used as a weapon, as a tool to disrupt our communities. Particularly during the (Richard) Nixon era, it was a disguise to break up and weaken our communities … it wasn’t a war on drugs, it was a war on poor brown and Black men and women, and it did terrible things to families for generations.”

But she's optimistic change is coming. So is Gullickson, who's committed to helping in any and every way she can.

Now married and a grandmother of 17 – she’s slowly rebuilt relationships with almost all her children – Gullickson shares her story and all its warts because she wants others to know no matter how ugly or decimated their lives are now, something different is waiting for them.

She believes legislation like Measure 110 will create an environment where “instead of being somewhere accidentally and hoping someone will walk in and give you hope, we’re doing that proactively.” She knows it’ll take time to fully implement and there will be issues along the way. She also knows if it works, it could be implemented in other places and millions of other people like her, who once felt hopeless, alone and isolated could find something else, something good to live for.

“If we do this right in Oregon, I think there’s a will to do it everywhere,” she says. “We’ve got a huge responsibility to show that this is the right thing, and it can work.”",https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/02/01/oregon-decriminalizes-all-drugs-offers-treatment-instead-jail-time/4311046001/

DiCaprio’s Earth Alliance said Thursday in a statement that the organization started the Australia Wildfire Fund to help with an “international response to the catastrophic bushfires” currently raging in the country. The Academy Award-winning actor co-chairs Earth Alliance, which was launched last year to combat climate change and biodiversity loss. Businesswoman and philanthropist Laurene Powell Jobs and investor and philanthropist Brian Sheth also co-chair.

The wildfires have scorched an area twice the size of the state of Maryland. The blazes have killed 25 people and destroyed 2,000 homes to date. The fires, fueled by drought and the country’s hottest and driest year on record, have been raging since September, months earlier than is typical for Australia’s annual wildfire season.

The fund will work with local Australian partner organizations including Aussie Ark, Bush Heritage and Wires Wildlife Rescue.

DiCaprio joins a growing list of other celebrities that have rallied to donate big bucks. Chris Hemsworth and Elton John each offered $1 million through social media earlier this week, and Pink, Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban have donated as well.

Haslam outlines tuition-free community college plan for adults,Tennessee may become the only state to offer tuition-free community college to high school students and adults.,1.0,"Adam Tamburin, USA TODAY NETWORK – Tennessee

In a surprise announcement during his State of the State address Monday, Gov. Bill Haslam outlined a plan to expand the Tennessee Promise scholarship model to allow adults to attend community college tuition-free.

The new scholarship, which will come before the General Assembly this year in the Tennessee Reconnect Act, is likely to further cement Haslam's national reputation as a change agent in higher education. If state lawmakers sign off on the program, Tennessee would become the only state in the nation to offer tuition-free community college to high school students and adults.

Before announcing the new scholarship for adults, Haslam emphasized the early success of Tennessee Promise, which has sent more than 33,000 high school students to community and technical colleges tuition-free since he proposed it during his 2014 State of the State speech. Expanding that model to adults, he said, was a natural next step.

“We need to reach the working mother that went to college but didn’t complete, or the son with sons of his own who like his dad never went to college but knows that he needs to upgrade his skills,"" Haslam said in his prepared remarks. ""Tonight, I’m introducing the next step in making certain that everyone in Tennessee has the opportunity to earn their degree.""

The lawmakers and officials packed inside the House chambers responded to the announcement with a thunderous standing ovation that lasted several seconds.

The Haslam administration has tried for years to entice adults without degrees to enroll in college, many times under the Reconnect banner. But the new scholarship program would represent the most sweeping effort by far, with more than 2 million adults potentially eligible.

Under Haslam's proposal, any adult Tennessee resident without a college degree or certificate could use the scholarship regardless of income or past academic performance. While college leaders suggested they would focus their recruiting efforts on the more than 900,000 Tennesseans with some college credit but no degree, adults who had never stepped foot on a college campus would be eligible as well.

""No caps. No first come, first served,"" Haslam said. ""Just as we did with Tennessee Promise we’re making a clear statement to families with Reconnect: Wherever you might fall on life’s path, education beyond high school is critical to the Tennessee we can be.

""We don’t want cost to be an obstacle anyone has to overcome as they pursue their own generational change for themselves and their families.”

State funding already covers tuition for adults who want to go to technical college, and there is a small program that pays community college tuition for adults who meet a rigorous slate of requirements. But officials expect the new community college scholarship, which will allow adults to attend college part time, to be a more popular option.

Funding for the new scholarship would come from the state's lottery proceeds. State dollars would be used to cover tuition only after all available federal aid was applied, a last-dollar model similar to Tennessee Promise.

Officials expect the Reconnect scholarship would cost the state $10 million annually.

David Gregory, the interim chancellor of the Tennessee Board of Regents college system, said the Reconnect scholarship would be a boon to the state's network of 13 community colleges, which have struggled to boost adult enrollment even as the Promise scholarship led to a surge in teenage students.

""This is a great time to continue the momentum that I feel like Tennessee has got right now,"" he said.

Gregory said that, to accommodate students who might be juggling coursework with a job and a family, colleges would need to ""enhance their efforts"" by considering night classes, weekend schedules and other nontraditional adjustments.

How Gov. Bill Haslam put together his gas tax plan

Haslam has become one of the nation's most outspoken advocates for college access since launching the Drive to 55 initiative in 2013. More than a dozen programs, including the Promise and Reconnect scholarships, have been launched under that umbrella — all with the goal of getting 55 percent of working-age Tennesseans to complete a college education by 2025.

To reach that goal, the state said, 871,000 additional Tennesseans would need to earn a degree or certificate. But only 645,000 high school students are expected to graduate in the next eight years, meaning the state will need to draw at least 155,000 adults onto campus and then graduation.

In a speech that Haslam acknowledged was stuffed with numbers, it was that prospect that drew emotion from the governor. Haslam told the audience he focused so heavily on higher education because he knew first-hand it had the power to change lives.

The governor told lawmakers about his father, Jim Haslam, who was in the audience, who was able to attend college because of a scholarship. Jim Haslam went on to start the massively successful Pilot Corp.

Because his father ""was the first in his family to attend college and get his degree,"" the governor said, ""the trajectory of his life — and mine — was changed forever.""

Landmines in DMZ to be cleared from Monday,The two Koreas will start clearing mines from the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) on October 1 as a first step after they agreed to disarm the border area starting with land mines.,1.0,"



By Lee Min-hyung







The two Koreas will start clearing mines from the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) on October 1 as a first step after they agreed to disarm the border area starting with land mines.







For 20 days from Monday, Seoul and Pyongyang plan to remove all mines from the Joint Security Area (JSA) along the DMZ, the Ministry of National Defense said, Sunday.







""The two Koreas will engage in joint works to remove mines and explosives on the JSA and upland areas in Cheorwon, Gangwon Province,"" a military official said.







The remains of about 300 soldiers from the two Koreas and United Nation forces killed during the 1950-1953 Korean War are believed to be buried in the upland areas.







The two Koreas chose the area as a trial venue for the joint repatriation mission.







The move is part of a follow-up measure to the Pyongyang Declaration signed in mid-September by President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.







The leaders of the two Koreas agreed to continue concerted efforts to disarm the DMZ and withdraw troops from there as a confidence-building measure amid detente on the Korean Peninsula.







The two Koreas and the United Nations Command (UNC) will also form a trilateral negotiating body to speed disarmament along the inter-Korean border.







Details of when the organization will be set up have not been confirmed, according to the defense ministry.







It remains to be seen whether the two Koreas can complete removing the mines as scheduled because of a limited workforce and a shortage of equipment.

A gay couple in Natick was targeted. Here’s how the neighborhood responded,"After a lesbian couple's home was vandalized for hanging a rainbow flag, more than 40 homes in their neighborhood hung up rainbow flags in solidarity",1.0,"But what happened next reminded the couple why they loved the neighborhood in the first place. On Sunday, a squadron of children on bicycles delivered rainbow flags to house after house.

""It really sent us reeling,"" Cari said.

NATICK – Cari and Lauri Ryding always felt welcome on Strawberry Hill Road. Then they came home from vacation and discovered the rainbow flag they had hung after the Orlando massacre had been stolen and their front porch pelted with eggs.

And one by one, the flags went up, transforming a swath of suburbia – more than 40 houses in all — into a brilliantly colored declaration of pride and solidarity, displayed on picket fences, garages, doorways, and decks.

""It just happened so quickly — the whole neighborhood said, 'Get me a flag. Get me a flag. Get me a flag,' "" said Penni Rochwerger, who lives around the corner from the Rydings. ""If we can stop whatever hate is out there, I think that's really important.""

Lauri Ryding said that after cleaning the eggs off her porch, she walked through the streets around her home, overwhelmed by all the neighbors prominently flying the rainbow colors.

""One person's act of fear and maliciousness created such a powerful statement of love,"" she said. ""We are very blessed, very fortunate.""

Lauri (left) and Cari Ryding returned from vacation and discovered their rainbow flag stolen and their house egged. Pat Greenhouse

Cari Ryding, 49, first moved to Strawberry Hill Road 23 years ago, and, she said, she immediately fell in love with the family-friendly feel of the place.

RELATED: How Boston powered the gay rights movement

""I loved the diversity of the generations, and how there's a commitment to that — of all ages, and all shapes, and sizes, and preferences,"" she said. ""I've been feeling this energy in the neighborhood for years.""

That feeling was reinforced, she said, after she separated from her husband 10 years ago, and her neighbors helped her adjust to life as a single parent, bringing her dinners if she was sick or watching two of her children if she had to take the third to the doctor.

And the bond deepened even further, she said, when neighbors who had met her husband welcomed her wife, Lauri, 52.

""When I moved in four and a half years ago, I was embraced,"" Lauri said. ""Our relationship was embraced.""

So both women were stunned when they came home Wednesday to discover the vandalism.

""It was our first experience in Natick of having any type of prejudice,"" Cari said. ""We hadn't experienced it all, and it kind of broke open our little cocoon.""

They alerted Natick police, and asked neighbors on Facebook if anyone knew what happened. No one did and still there are no suspects. But many were outraged.

RELATED | The Word: There is no 'gay' voice

One neighbor suggested asking for a stack of flags from the Rainbow Peace Flag Project, a local organization that gives away the flags free to Natick-area residents.

The Rydings had ordered their flag from the group about a month ago, to honor the 49 victims killed in June at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando.

Immediately, requests flooded in, along with donations to the group.

""We said, 'Why don't we all have the flags? They can't take them from all of us,'"" said Dennis Gaughan, whose wife, Maura, helped organize the rainbow response.

TIMELINE: Same-sex marriage in the US

Lois McGillivray, 85, who has lived on Strawberry Hill Road for 50 years, had one of the rainbow flags proudly displayed on her home on Monday.

""I have never met anyone who would do what that person did to that house,"" she said. ""This is a place where nobody bothers anybody, no matter how you want to live, as long as you're not digging up the garden and throwing the dirt in my yard.""

Neil Podolski said he wanted to fly a rainbow flag, as well, after hearing that the Rydings' home had been vandalized.

""It's just not right,"" said Podolski, who is Jewish. ""Who's to say tomorrow we don't find a swastika on our house?""

Cari Ryding said that she had started thinking twice about her neighborhood after her home was targeted, ""and what they did completely overshadowed that fear and we are just overwhelmed with the kindness and generosity.""

As jarring as the initial crime was, Lauri Ryding said, the response has helped restore their faith in their community.

""Somebody's fear called them to action,"" she said. ""But our neighbors' support and love called them to action, and love conquers hate. Love wins. We win.""

Tunisia becomes the first Arab nation to approve gender equality in inheritance law,Tunisia becomes the first Arab nation to approve gender equality in inheritance law,1.0,"Tunisians demand altering religious law concerning inheritance in Tunis on March 10, 2018 AFP

The law was approved on Friday

The Tunisian cabinet- the first among Arab nations- has approved the law of gender equality in inheritance, which is to be discussed in the parliament dominated by Ennahda Movement before being effective in the country.

The law was approved on Friday, which has been suggested by the Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi in August 2017, on occasion of national women’s day.

The controversial law permits women and men to have an equal inheritance, contradicting the Qur’anic verse which states the share of women's inheritance is half that of men's.

The law will also guarantee a freedom of choice between following the constitution or the Sharia Islamic law.

Essebsi, overseeing the Tunisian cabinet, said he based his legislative initiative on the Tunisian constitution which states that “Tunisia is a civil country that is based on three elements: Citizenship, the will of the people, and the supremacy of law.”

He also said that the constitution stated “the rights and duties of Tunisian men and women are equal, and that the state is committed to defending women’s rights and works on supporting and developing them.”

'We made it happen': Green Bay Water Utility replaces city's final lead pipe after years-long effort,'We made it happen': Green Bay Water Utility replaces city's final lead pipe after years-long effort,1.0,"GREEN BAY - The Green Bay Water Utility on Tuesday removed its last lead pipe in the city, closing a chapter in a years-long effort to improve water quality for residents.

Officials announced the milestone at a news conference Tuesday before removing an east-side lead service line and replacing it with a copper pipe. That marked the 1,782nd utility-owned line replaced since January 2016, when the utility ramped up lead removal amid the Flint, Michigan, water crisis.

""Our (lead) levels are way down,"" said Nancy Quirk, the utility's general manager.

Green Bay last installed lead pipes in 1944 and began replacing them in 1990, when the city had 4,400. In 2011, the water utility found levels in some homes were above limits set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and identified 1,782 utility-owned and 247 privately owned service lines that needed replacing.

Lead poisoning can cause brain damage and result in learning disabilities, developmental delays or reduced attention span, according to the state Department of Health Services. Children are the most vulnerable to those health risks.

Quirk said the utility has eliminated all but one privately owned lead pipe. The final line goes through a home pending foreclosure and will be replaced once it belongs to the bank.

The utility spent over $6 million to replace the city's remaining lead service lines, in part through two rate increases over the five-year period. The initiative also got a boost from the Lambeau Field tax credit and loans from the state Department of Natural Resources. Homeowners with lead lines were not required to pay for a replacement.

Quirk believed it was important to remove the source of the lead entirely instead of using a chemical treatment, which she feared could increase phosphorus levels in the Fox River. The utility also flushes the system to keep water clean and will monitor copper levels to ensure the new pipes don't cause any problems.

""We made it happen,"" she said.

Teen registering voters as they get Popeye's chicken sandwich,Teen registered people to vote as they waited in Popeyes line for new chicken sandwich,1.0,"Ledbetter himself is not even old enough to vote, but says he wanted to push for others to get involved in local politics.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. — Instead of the complaining about the long lines at Popeyes as everyone waited to try their chicken sandwich, 17-year-old David Ledbetter took the opportunity to make some real change in his community.

Ledbetter was seen this weekend standing outside a Charlotte Popeyes registering people to vote.

The Myers Park senior is not even old enough to vote himself but said he wanted to push for others to get involved in local politics.

""I decided to register people to vote after I saw there was a lack of young people politically involved,"" Ledbetter said.

“I believe that it is our duty to vote as American citizens and it would be wrong not to exercise our political voice,"" Ledbetter said.

""A lot of young people wanted to try the sandwich and we knew we had to come to the young people and that was the only way they would be more motivated to be engaged,"" Ledbetter said.

He took advantage of the large crowds by handing out sample ballots and voter registration forms urging people to show up to the polls as well.

Popeye's has gotten a lot of media attention lately after fast-food chains Popeyes and Chick-fil-A were pitted against each other in a social media food fight over their chicken sandwiches.

""A lot of individuals were already registered and that was nice to know, bang that they were involved,"" Ledbetter said.

On Saturday alone, he was still able to register 16 people.

His efforts are now being recognized across the nation after posting photos to his Instagram.

""It's nice to know I made a lot of impressions on as many individuals as I have,"" Ledbetter said.

Now he's only hoping the newfound publicity pushes more people to be informed, involved and registered.

""Wrapped around a fast food building, what about being wrapped around your country and knowing who's running it,"" one Popeyes customer said.

Ledbetter plans to register next year when he finally turns 18 but the teenager is already a leader in our community. He's involved in an organization called Imagine This -- the goal is to help students get to college.

The large crowds around Popeyes began as many rushed to try out Popeyes new chicken sandwich for $3.99.

Africans are living longer than at any point in the last 25 years,"Life expectancy in Africa has increased by 9.4 years since 2000, thanks to improvements in child survival, progress in malaria control, and expanded access to HIV/AIDS drugs (x-post from r/upliftingtrends)",1.0,"In a year which has seen Africa’s biggest economies falter as the rhetoric of a boom has been questioned, data from the WHO’s World Health Statistics 2016 report shows a much-needed positive: life expectancy on the continent is better than it was in 2000. While the report shows a global spike in life expectancy across the various regions, Africa has gained the most increase with life expectancy up 9.4 years between 2000 and 2015.

Africa’s improvement in life expectancy was the biggest increase recorded across all the regions. This increase, WHO says, is mainly down to the success recorded in the continent’s fight with the AIDS epidemic. After resulting in a severe decline in life expectancy on the continent in the 1990s, improved access to treatment for the virus has aided the reversal of the trend. Also attributed as a reason for the improvement in life expectancy has been the progress in malaria control and treatment. With as many as six African nations possibly getting rid of the disease by 2020 and malaria mortality rates falling by 66% across all age groups, the continent is on course to eliminate the disease faster than expected. The continent’s progress is highlighted by another fact: of the 37 countries that have recorded a 10% increase in life expectancy, 30 are in Africa, according to World Bank data.

But despite the many positives, more needs to be done as Africa remains home to the world’s lowest life expectancy rates for both genders. Sierra Leone have the world’s lowest rate of any country for both genders and Chad, Angola and Central African Republic (C.A.R) all feature among the bottom five countries for life expectancy rates for both genders.

In general, Algeria (75.6) ranks as the country with the best life expectancy rate on the continent. Asides Algeria, Cape Verde, Morocco, Libya, Tunisia and Seychelles all have life expectancy rates higher than the global average (71.4).",https://qz.com/690297/africans-are-living-longer-than-at-any-point-in-the-last-25-years/

Lowe's Companies Inc. announced Thursday that it would be doling out an additional round of bonuses to support employees ""with unforeseen expenses and hardships"" during the COVID-19 pandemic.

On Aug. 21, full-time hourly associates will receive $300 and part-time and seasonal associates will receive $150. The August bonuses will match the funds previously provided to hourly associates March and May as well as earlier this month, the company announced.

Lowe's said the total amount it is spending on this round of bonuses is about $100 million, pushing its total investment in coronavirus relief funding for associates to approximately $500 million.

""No one could have anticipated how long we would be navigating this pandemic together,"" Lowe's CEO Marvin R. Ellison said. ""As we approach the start of another school year, our commitment to support our hard-working associates will continue into August.""

Paraguay lagoon sees giant lily pads return,Giant lily pads have reappeared in a Paraguay lagoon after being listed as endangered in 2006.,1.0,"Image caption Water lilies in the area are known for their giant size and exceptional shape

Giant lily pads have reappeared in a Paraguay lagoon after being listed as endangered in 2006.

The aquatic plants, their scientific name is Victoria cruziana, appeared in a tributary of the Paraguay river 25km north of Asunción, the capital.

The environment ministry told the Associated Press that the plant had slowly disappeared due to dredging and visitors collecting the plants.

Water lilies in the area are known for their 1.5m size, and exceptional shape.

Their return has drawn a mass of tourists to Piquete Cue in central Paraguay, where they take pictures and pay for boat rides to see the lilies up close.

""I have lived in the area since I was a child. The neighbours and I thought the plant had already become extinct, but it has returned,"" Antonio Benítez, a local resident, told The Associated Press (in Spanish) .

Agustin Gomez, a tourist, was stunned by their size. ""This is something that you just don't see every day, or even every year. You do see lily pads all the time but not so many. And not so enormous! Some are 2m wide,"" he said.

Locals use the aquatic plant to make a medicinal tea that they believe can help combat asthma and bronchial disorders, but the authorities have warned that those who try to harvest it could be fined.",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/world-latin-america-42620337

"Woman, 88, waved to students from her window for years. They gathered outside her home for one final goodbye","Woman, 88, waved to students from her window for years. They gathered outside her home for one final goodbye",1.0,"(CNN) Tinney Davidson gave her neighborhood 12 years of warm hellos. And now that she is moving to an assisted living facility, they got together to give her the sweetest goodbye.

Davidson, 88, moved to Comox, British Columbia, with her husband in 2007, according to CNN's news partner CHEK . Their home was near a high school, and every morning the couple would wave to the students passing by on the way to school. She developed a friendship with the students, and some would come and visit her at home, CHEK reported Friday.

Students carrying signs and flowers walked together to Davidson's home, stood on her lawn and blew her a collective kiss.

She continued the morning ritual even after her husband died. ""I just liked the look of the children and they all looked in and I thought, 'If they're looking in, I'll wave to them,' and that's how it started,"" Davidson told CHEK.

Davidson will be moving to an assisted living home, and will not be able to wish the neighborhood students well as they make their morning trek to school.

So last week, hundreds of students carrying signs and flowers walked together to Davidson's home, stood on her lawn and blew her a collective kiss as she looked on from her porch, CHEK said. They carried colorful signs adorned with love hearts.

Your playlist will load after this ad

Hutt South MP Ginny Andersen’s Member’s Bill, The Holidays (Bereavement Leave for Miscarriage) Amendment Bill (No 2), provides for three days bereavement leave following the end of a pregnancy as a result of miscarriage or stillbirth.

According to a statement from the Labour MP's office, the leave provisions would apply to mothers and their partners, as well as parents planning to have a child through adoption or surrogacy.

""The passing of this bill shows that once again New Zealand is leading the way for progressive and compassionate legislation, becoming only the second country in the world to provide leave for miscarriage and stillbirth,” Andersen said.

""The bill will give women and their partners time to come to terms with their loss without having to tap into sick leave. Because their grief is not a sickness, it is a loss. And loss takes time.""

Andersen added praise for colleagues who helped her pass the bill.

""I’d like to acknowledge my parliamentary colleagues from across the House for their unanimous support for my bill. It is always heartening when consensus can be achieved for causes that matter.

""I’d also like to acknowledge Kathryn van Beek, whose staunch advocacy laid the foundations for this bill.

Europe Is Guaranteeing Citizens the “Right to Repair”,"Europe Is Guaranteeing Citizens the “Right to Repair” - Across Europe, legislation is pushing back against a waste-based economy and restoring for citizens something companies have gradually taken away: the right to repair what they’ve bought.",1.0,"Roman Hottgenroth is surrounded by lamps, dishwashers and vacuum cleaners. Computers, smartphones and TV receivers are piled high on tin shelves behind him. A group of washing machines rattles loudly in test mode, only somewhat drowned out by the bass thumping from a hi-fi system an employee is checking.

None of these products work properly, and that’s the point.

Here at Stilbruch, the department store in Hamburg, Germany run by the city’s sanitation department, only goods that others have thrown away are offered up for sale. But before they are sold, they are checked and, if necessary, repaired in Hottgenroth’s 7,500-square-foot workshop. The process is something of a dying art. “Unfortunately, [repair] is no longer intended for most appliances,” says Hottgenroth, Stilbruch’s operations manager.

But that may be changing. Across Europe, legislation is pushing back against a waste-based economy and restoring for citizens something companies have gradually taken away: the right to repair what they’ve bought.

Electronic components await inspection and possible repair at the Stilbruch workshop. (Photo courtesy Hamburg Sanitation Department)

Fix it or forget it

Hottgenroth sees every day how many appliances end up in the trash. Although often all they need is a fresh battery or receiver, “Spare parts are hard to come by, and all the components are soldered, glued or riveted,” he says. This is why, while his employees can fix many products, many others are unsalvageable. “Because of their design, devices often break just when you try to open them.” In addition, there is usually no longer any provision for upgrading and adapting devices to new technical standards. “This should be banned,” Hottgenroth says flatly.

Some political leaders agree. In November, the EU Parliament called on the European Commission to make routine repair of everyday products easier, systematic and cost-efficient. It said that warranties should be extended, and that replacement parts should be improved and made more accessible, as should information enabling general repair and maintenance.

The EU’s existing eco-design regulations could be an instrument to reach these goals. These mandates were established years ago to improve the energy efficiency of products sold in the EU. But in March, the first eco-design regulation that will define standards for repair and useful life will come into force. Manufacturers of washing machines, dishwashers, refrigerators and monitors will have to ensure that components are replaceable with common tools. Instruction manuals must be accessible to specialist companies. And producers must supply spare parts within 15 days.

Cell phones, computers and tablets, however, have not yet been regulated by an EU eco-design directive, and constitute some of the most harmful consumer waste. To this end, individual member states have moved ahead with their own regulations. This month, France will introduce an anti-waste law with a repair index. A grade of one through ten will appear on the labels of washing machines, laptops, smartphones, TVs and lawn mowers. This score will be calculated based on criteria such as ease of disassembly, access to repair information, and price and availability of spare parts. The French government is also promoting modular product design, and is aiming to have 60 percent of electronic equipment in France be repairable by 2026.

Europe is one of the largest markets in the world, which means that new EU design guidelines and right to repair mandates could force manufacturers across the world to make more durable products. The shift can’t come soon enough. At over ten million tons per year, e-waste is the fastest growing waste stream in Europe. In Germany alone, two million tons are generated annually. Repairing products and extending their useful life could play a key role in mitigating the environmental consequences of all this waste. And that’s exactly what a large majority of EU citizens want. Nearly 80 percent would rather repair their devices than replace them. And a majority think that manufacturers should be legally obliged to facilitate the repair of digital devices or the replacement of their individual parts.

Such products have existed for some time — companies like Fairphone and Shiftphone produce sustainable, repairable smartphones, for instance. But with the EU’s new legislative mandates on the horizon, bigger players are getting ahead of the game.

Apple has launched a repair program for independent businesses, in which companies can get Apple parts, tools, training, service guides, diagnostics and resources to perform a variety of out-of-warranty repairs. Last year the German outdoor gear company Vaude began providing customers with an index showing how repairable each of its products are. Electrolux, a leading manufacturer of electrical appliances in Europe, has been preparing for the directive and will be ready to comply once it takes effect in March. “We will now ensure that the specific parts, according to the legislation, will be available directly to consumers,” says Viktor Sundberg, vice president of European & environmental affairs at Electrolux. “And we will make the repair information available to independent repairers for the categories requested.”

Is that sufficient? For Dorothea Kessler of iFixit Europe, the EU Parliament has indeed sent a strong signal that the continent must embrace a more sustainable circular economy. But it’s only a start. “We will certainly have to wait a few more years for feasible measures to emerge for the most important product categories,” she says. In the process, she believes it won’t be easy for the EU to stand up to the manufacturers’ lobbies.

Consumer and environmental organizations have also welcomed the EU Parliament resolution with cautious optimism. “The right to repair was already in the Green Deal of December 2019 as a buzzword,” says Elke Salzmann of the Federation of Consumer Organizations in Germany, referring to Europe’s commitment to become the first climate-neutral continent. “But we have to take care that the promise will be obliging.”

In the meantime, iFixit has been assigning a repairability rating to every new device on the market for years, and provides free step-by-step instructions for do-it-yourself repairs in 11 languages for 70,000 products. Its online forum allows users to exchange ideas with other tinkerers. The online community, founded in California, now has three million monthly users in Europe and ten million worldwide. To Kessler, it’s a movement that has as much to do with altering mindsets as fixing gadgets. “Our philosophy is that something doesn’t belong to you if you can’t open it,” she says.

Japan set to target zero emissions by 2050 in policy shift,Japan set to target zero emissions by 2050 in policy shift,1.0,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga is set to bind Japan to a target for carbon neutrality by 2050, a shift in stance that will bring the country in line with the European Union and more than 60 other nations in efforts to combat climate change.

FILE PHOTO: Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga speaks to the media during a press conference in Jakarta, Indonesia, October 21, 2020. Dita Alangkara/Pool via REUTERS/File photo

The new target will be announced by Suga when he makes his first address to parliament on Monday, after taking office last month, the Nikkei reported earlier this week.

Japan previously said it would aim to reduce emissions by 80% by 2050 and achieve net-zero emissions sometime in the latter half of the century.

The move, if confirmed, would make the world’s third-largest economy the second Asian country after South Korea to aim for the 2050 target that is considered the minimum needed to keep global average temperatures from rising by more than 1.5 Celsius.

Japan is the world’s fifth-biggest emitter of carbon dioxide, the heat trapping gas that scientists say is already causing major heatwaves, bigger and more powerful cyclones and periods of drought around the world.

Under pressure from many business sectors, moves are also afoot to increase the use of renewable energy as the government starts forcing the shutdown of older, dirtier coal plants.

But investors say the apparent change in position is at odds with the country’s plans to roll out new coal stations.

“Any net zero commitment from a coal-intensive economy, such as Japan, has to be coupled with an urgent and credible coal phase out plan to be taken seriously,” Jan Erik Saugestad, CEO of Norway’s Storebrand Asset Management told Reuters.

Storebrand has assets under management of around $90 billion with investments in Japanese companies and has been critical of Japan’s stance on coal.

“Japan’s solar and wind power potential is huge and Prime Minister Suga has the opportunity to accelerate this and embrace a modern and coal-free energy system,” he added.

Pressure has also been building from below with the number of cities, towns and villages aiming for carbon neutrality by 2050 increasing to 163 from 4 in a little over a year, according to the environment ministry.

Still, there are plenty of vested interests to stymie the efforts including from the old power utilities, car and steel makers, along with industrial companies that use coal boilers to produce steam needed for manufacturing purposes, all of whom have plenty of lobbying power.

Companies running smaller, older coal plants are already lobbying the government heavily for exemptions to the plans shut to them down, an official at one of Japan’s trading houses that supplies them with fuel told Reuters this week.

But Japan’s most powerful business federation, known as Keidanren, is now advocating the 2050 target with its chairman Hiroaki Nakanishi pushing the line at the prime minister’s economic advisory council, according to minutes from the Oct. 6 meeting.

A report released in August showed how Keidanren is dominated by energy-intensive sectors representing less than 10% of the economy, resulting in national policies that favour coal and hindering efforts on climate change.

Peanut allergy cured in majority of children in immunotherapy trial,Peanut allergy cured in majority of children in immunotherapy trial. Australian researchers hail breakthrough after ‘life-changing’ tolerance persists for up to four years.,1.0,"Australian researchers have made a breakthrough in the treatment of peanut allergy in children.

A small clinical trial conducted at the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute has led to two-thirds of children treated with an experimental immunotherapy treatment being cured of their allergy. Importantly, this desensitisation to peanuts persisted for up to four years after treatment.

“These children had been eating peanut freely in their diet without having to follow any particular program of peanut intake in the years after treatment was completed,” said the lead researcher, Prof Mimi Tang.

Peanut allergy is the most common cause of anaphylaxis, a life-threatening allergic reaction, and one of the most common causes of death from food allergy.

To combat this Tang, an immunologist and allergist, pioneered a new form of treatment that combines a probiotic with peanut oral immunotherapy, known as PPOIT. Instead of avoiding the allergen, the treatment is designed to reprogram the immune system’s response to peanuts and eventually develop a tolerance.

It’s thought that combining the probiotic with the immunotherapy gives the immune system the “nudge” it needs to do this, according to Tang.

Forty-eight children were enrolled in the PPOIT trial and were randomly given either a combination of the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus with peanut protein in increasing amounts, or a placebo, once daily for 18 months.

At the end of the original trial in 2013, 82% of children who received the immunotherapy treatment were deemed tolerant to peanuts compared with just 4% in the placebo group.

Four years later, the majority of the children who gained initial tolerance were still eating peanuts as part of their normal diet and 70% passed a further challenge test to confirm long-term tolerance.

Tang said the results were exciting and had been life-changing for participants. “The way I see it is that we had children who came into the study allergic to peanuts, having to avoid peanuts in their diet, being very vigilant around that, carrying a lot of anxiety with that and, at the end of treatment and even four years later, many of these children who had benefited from our probiotic peanut therapy could now live like a child who didn’t have peanut allergy.”

The results are published in the Lancet Child & Adolescent Health.

If confirmed by larger clinical studies, the broader hope is that this treatment can have an impact on the high rates of food allergy among children.

“This is a major step forward in identifying an effective treatment to address the food allergy problem in western societies,” Tang said.",https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/aug/17/peanut-allergy-cured-in-majority-of-children-in-immunotherapy-trial

World's biggest container shipper commits to carbon neutrality by 2050,World's biggest container shipper commits to carbon neutrality by 2050 - Danish container shipping giant Maersk has pledged to become a carbon-neutral business by 2050 - the first commitment of its kind from the global maritime shipping sector.,1.0,"World's biggest container shipper commits to carbon neutrality by 2050

Danish container shipping giant Maersk has pledged to become a carbon-neutral business by 2050 - the first commitment of its kind from the global maritime shipping sector.

Announced on Wednesday (5 December), the move will see Maersk work with governments and industry in order to help spur the development of net-zero vessels and shipping fuels in a bid to make these technologies commercially viable by 2030.

Given that the average container shipping vessel has a lifespan of 20-25 years, Maersk’s chief operating officer Søren Toft said that taking ambitious action to decarbonise the shipping sector within the next decade will be “crucial” in achieving the International Maritime Organisation's (IMO) 2050 target of halving CO2 emissions from 2008 levels.

“The only possible way to achieve the so-much-needed decarbonisation in our industry is by fully transforming to new carbon-neutral fuels and supply chains,” Toft said. “Going forward, we cannot do this alone.”

While collaboration will be key to meeting its 2050 ambition, Maersk is also set to make “significant” investment into retrofitting its existing vessels, purchasing electric ground vehicles, sourcing renewable power and installing energy efficiency technologies.

An exact figure has not yet been disclosed, but Maersk has notably invested around $1bn each year into research and development projects around low-carbon technologies since 2014. Through this investment, it has trained more than 50 engineers in the design and installation processes for energy efficiency technologies.

The announcement comes off the back of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) landmark report, which warns that the world must achieve net-zero emsissions by mid-century if global temperature increases are to be limited to 1.5C.

Setting a course for sustainability

According to a report by the European Parliament, the international shipping industry is currently responsible for about 2.5% of global CO2 emissions – but this proportion could rise to 17% by 2050 if the sector is left unregulated.

Cargo and container ships are an important transportation method, carrying billions of tonnes of goods across select trade groups each year. However, the heavy boats are often heavy emitters, with research suggesting that vessels of 5,000 gross tonnage and above account for 85% of carbon emissions from the shipping sector.

Some of the largest corporations within the sector have already made progress towards decarbonising their operations, with global non-profit BSR’s Clean Cargo Working Group estimating that emissions per container move have dropped by 37.1% since 2009.

Leading this trend, Maersk has reduced its relative CO2 emissions by 46% against a 2007 baseline, largely through the adoption of energy efficiency technologies and the sourcing of renewable power.

Indeed, since the IMO approved a roadmap through to 2023 on the global adoption of an emissions reduction strategy in 2016, more than 170 countries have reached an agreement to reduce CO2 emissions from their respective maritime sectors by at least 50%, against a 2008 baseline.

But as ambition levels rise, progress to convert aims into action continues to be slow, with the Clean Cargo Working Group’s most recent research concluding that absolute emissions accounted for by the 22 largest companies within the industry had fallen just 1% between 2016 and 2017.

To spur more ambitious action, BSR is now calling on those within the sector to turn to innovation. Agri-food giant Cargill notably launched the first industry competition to incentivise the development of innovative solutions to maritime shipping’s carbon challenges earlier this year.

The face of 12 year-old Dublin native Ryan Wyer has become emblematic of Aphex Twin’s new Cheetah EP, released today. Wyer was chosen by Richard D. James (a.k.a. Aphex Twin) and his label, Warp records, to direct the official video for ‘CIRKLON3 [ Колхозная mix ]’ (Ryan also stars in the video). Today, Aphex Twin posted this heartwarming shot of Wyer celebrating Cheetah‘s release:

So how did it all happen? The short answer, according to Ryan, is that “Rich thinks I make cool videos.” Ryan’s mother, Marie O’Toole Wyer, transcribed her son’s answers to interview questions via email. Asked to describe his hometown of Rush, County Dublin, Ryan said, “I live by the sea in a small town, it’s quiet and peaceful.” When he grows up, Ryan hopes to be “a musician and a director.” He’s certainly off to a promising start.

Ryan’s journey with Aphex Twin began when James and Warp took notice of videos on Wyer’s YouTube channel. Ryan’s channel included Aphex Twin ‘fan videos,’ including one for ‘minipops 67 [120.2][source field mix].’ The Wyers were surprised when Warp contacted Ryan to create an official Aphex Twin video. According to Marie, “Warp said that Ryan had been spoken about a lot and they loved his work.” Ryan’s admirers also included filmmaker Chris Cunningham, whose twisted Aphex Twin videos (like those for ‘Window Licker’ and ‘Come to Daddy’) are considered masterworks of the music video medium. According to Marie, both James and Cunningham wrote comments on videos on Ryan’s YouTube channel.

Warp sent Ryan the Cheetah EP and asked him to make a video for a track of his choosing. As for the creative process, Ryan says, “Warp and Rich told me to do what I do best, that’s all.” Ryan’s ‘CIRKLON3 [Колхозная mix]’ video includes footage of Wyer dancing with friends and family. The cast are adorned with Aphex Twin shirts and eery, humorous masks bearing an iconic image of James’ face. Marie explains that “Warp and Richard put Ryan under no pressure and were very supportive and helpful along the whole process.”

Marie noted similarities in the personalities of Ryan and Mr. James. “As most people know,” she wrote, “Richard likes to stay out of the limelight and is quite private and has a very quirky sense of humour – actually very like Ryan. Ryan loves his own space and doesn’t really care what others think of him. So they have very similar personalities.”

The reality of Ryan’s international exposure settled in when the family saw his video screened publicly on a digital display in Tokyo. “Ryan’s face just lit up with excitement,” Marie explained. “We shed many tears of happiness for our very special, talented young man.” The entire experience “has given Ryan a huge confidence boost,” she says. Marie also noted that Ryan’s story has served as an inspiration to other children who have a disability and their families. Ryan has autism and is visually impaired.

“Ryan has listened and loved music from a very young age,” Marie wrote, “and we always knew he would do something with music. He expresses how he feels through music…. We are hugely thankful to Richard and Warp for seeing Ryan’s talent and giving him this amazing opportunity. They made his dreams come true.”

Early this week, Marie tweeted this photo of two friends shopping for records:",http://www.culturecreature.com/ryan-wyer-interview-aphex-twin/
106-Year-Old Maharashtra Woman Wins Battle Against COVID-19,"106-Year-Old Maharashtra (India) Woman Wins Battle Against COVID-19: Dr Rahul Ghule, managing director of ''One Rupee Clinic'' which is managing this COVID-19 treatment facility, appreciated his team for taking care of the elderly woman",1.0,"The woman from Thane was discharged from hospital on Sunday.

A 106-year-old woman from Maharashtra's Thane district defeated COVID-19 and was discharged from hospital on Sunday with doctors and nurses giving her a warm farewell.

With happiness writ large on her face, the woman proudly displayed her discharge certificate to the media before walking out of the hospital after a 10-day stay.

After the Dombivli-based centenarian contracted the disease, no hospital was initially ready to admit her due to her age, said her daughter-in-law, who were happy to see her mother-in-law discharged from the hospital after recovering from the disease.

She was finally admitted 10 days back to the COVID-19 treatment facility set up by the Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) at Savlaram Krida Sankul (sports complex) and doctors and medical teams there took proper care of her, the daughter-in-law said.

""We are really thankful to the hospital's medical team who took proper care of her and helped her in defeating the coronavirus,"" she said.

Dr Rahul Ghule, managing director of ''One Rupee Clinic'' which is managing this COVID-19 treatment facility, appreciated his team for taking care of the elderly woman. ""We are happy that she successfully responded to the treatment,"" he said, adding that the hospital was opened on July 27, and so far it has treated 1,100 COVID-19 patients.

''One Rupee Clinics'', which charge Re 1 per patient for their services, have been set up at select stations on the Central Railway''s suburban section to provide emergency help to rail accident victims and give medical treatment to the general public.

Maharashtra cabinet minister Aaditya Thackery took to Twitter to laud the KDMC staff and Shiv Sena's Kalyan MP Shrikant Shinde for providing proper treatment to the elderly woman.

He said the blessings of the woman and many more like her ""keep us all going strong"".

KDMC spokesperson Madhuri Phopale said so far 38,301 COVID-19 cases have been reported from areas falling under the civic limits and of these, 762 have died due to the disease.

As of now, there are 5,451 active COVID-19 cases in Kalyan-Dombivli while 32,088 patients have recovered, she said.",https://www.ndtv.com/cities/coronavirus-106-year-old-maharashtra-woman-wins-battle-against-covid-19-2298298
"She was demoted, doubted and rejected. Now, her work is the basis of the Covid-19 vaccine","She was demoted, doubted and rejected. Now, her work is the basis of the Covid-19 vaccine",1.0,"(CNN) Covid-19 vaccines are starting to roll out in several countries, a momentous breakthrough that hopefully signals a light at the end of this dark pandemic. For Katalin Karikó, the moment is particularly special.

Karikó has spent decades of her career researching the therapeutic possibilities of mRNA, a component of DNA that is considered to be one of the main building blocks of life. Through multiple setbacks, job losses, doubt and a transatlantic move, Karikó stood by her conviction: That mRNA could be used for something truly groundbreaking. Now, that work is the basis of the Covid-19 vaccine.

From Hungary to the US

Karikó, 65, began her career in her native Hungary in the 1970s, when mRNA research was new and the possibilities seemed endless. But the call of the American dream (and more researching and funding opportunities) took root.

In 1985, she and her husband and young daughter left Hungary for the US after she got an invitation from Temple University in Philadelphia. They sold their car, Karikó told The Guardian , and stuffed the money -- an equivalent of about $1,200 -- in their daughter's teddy bear for safekeeping.",https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/16/us/katalin-kariko-covid-19-vaccine-scientist-trnd/index.html
"Dolly Parton gifts books to more than 3,000 Cork children","Dolly Parton said that she is ""excited"" that her Imagination Library project will launch in Cork on Wednesday, bringing books to some 3,000 children.",1.0,"Dolly Parton said that she is ""excited"" that her Imagination Library project will launch in Cork on Wednesday, bringing books to some 3,000 children.

The country music legend said: ""I truly believe that if every child has a song in their heart and a book in their hand, they can see all of their dreams come true.

""Cork, and all of Ireland, has a special place in my heart. It feels like home to me and hopefully one day, sooner than later, I will be coming home again!""

As part of the global initiative, one book will be sent every month to registered children from birth to age five in participating communities, allowing them to build their own libraries.

The Imagination Library has already shared 147m books with children since the project launched as part of The Dollywood Foundation in 1995.

Communities have been selected across Cork city and county, and families in these areas can register from Wednesday.

“You can never get enough books into the hands of young children,"" country music icon Dolly said.

""I know there are children in Ireland with their own dreams — the dream of becoming a doctor, an inventor, or a teacher. Who knows; maybe a writer, or singer. The seeds of these dreams can often be found in books and the seeds planted in a community can grow across the world.”

Young Knocknaheeny Area Based Childhood Programme, a community-based prevention, promotion and early intervention programme on the northside of Cork city, is leading the Imagination Library's introduction to Cork with support from the Cork Interagency Working Group and funding partners.

Grace Walsh, speech and language therapist with Young Knocknaheeny, said they wanted to launch the project in Cork after hearing of its success in Tallaght, Dublin, where it was brought to Ireland for the first time in February 2019.

Some 4,980 children have enrolled in this programme and a further 1,470 children have graduated from it.

Almost 87,000 children’s books have been gifted in Tallaght through this programme to date.

“Dolly Parton set up this project to inspire a love of reading from an early age,"" Ms Walsh said.

As a speech and language therapist myself, fostering language and literacy skills for all children is a huge goal

“So much research shows now that early literacy skills can predict later learning, language and literacy success. So setting up that foundation really early on, giving children as many skills as possible, can help them achieve their potential.""

The project is completely free to families as local fundraising pays for the cost price of the books and An Post has offered to deliver the books for free this year.

Families from Knocknaheeny, Hollyhill, Gurranabraher, Churchfield, Mahon, Carrigtwohill, Ashbourne House direct provision centre and the Kinsale Road direct provision centre have been chosen to partake in this project, although Ms Walsh hopes that it will eventually be extended to all children in Ireland.

“Any families living in these areas can register and a free book will be delivered to their home every month, addressed to them, so the child can start building their own library and will know that someone was thinking of them, that they’re special,"" Ms Walsh said.",https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/munster/arid-40079393.html

The news comes as she continues her quest to give away much of her wealth since her $38 billion divorce settlement with Bezos.

In a new Medium post, Scott, who has a net worth topping $60 billion, announced the nearly $4.2 billion in donations to organizations ranging from food banks to emergency relief funds. The news comes after announcing back in July that she'd already given $1.7 billion to 114 organizations over the past year.

Scott wrote in her latest blog post that after her post in July, she asked a ""team of advisors"" to help her as she sought to give immediate support to those being affected by the economic crisis related to the pandemic.

""They took a data-driven approach to identifying organizations with strong leadership teams and results, with special attention to those operating in communities facing high projected food insecurity, high measures of racial inequity, high local poverty rates, and low access to philanthropic capital,"" Scott wrote in her post.

""These 384 carefully selected teams have dedicated their lives to helping others, working and volunteering and serving real people face-to-face at bedsides and tables, in prisons and courtrooms and classrooms, on streets and hospital wards and hotlines and frontlines of all types and sizes, day after day after day.""

Scott continued, writing that she was ""far from completing"" her pledge but encouraged others to donate a gift to ""one of the thousands of organizations doing remarkable work all across the country.""

As reported by Business Insider, the world's richest have seen their net worths skyrocket by nearly $1 trillion amid the pandemic. Scott is no exception, with Bloomberg reporting that her wealth increased by $23.6 billion this year, primarily due to her shares in Amazon, which saw a surge.

Chuck Collins, the director of the Program on Inequality and the Common Good at the Institute for Policy Studies, endorsed Scott's latest donation. ""MacKenzie Scott's bold and direct giving puts shame to the billionaire class and their perpetual private foundations,"" he said in a statement.

Fungi That 'Eat' Radiation Are Growing on the Walls of Chernobyl's Ruined Nuclear Reactor,Fungi That 'Eat' Radiation Are Growing on the Walls of Chernobyl's Ruined Nuclear Reactor,1.0,"Back in 1991, scientists were amazed when they made the discovery...

In the eerie environment inside the abandoned Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, researchers remotely piloting robots spotted pitch black fungi growing on the walls of the decimated No. 4 nuclear reactor and even apparently breaking down radioactive graphite from the core itself. What's more, the fungi seemed to be growing towards sources of radiation, as if the microbes were attracted to them!

More than a decade later, University of Saskatchewan Professor Ekaterina Dadachova (then at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York) and her colleagues acquired some of the fungi and found that they grew faster in the presence of radiation compared to other fungi. The three species tested, Cladosporium sphaerospermum, Cryptococcus neoformans and Wangiella dermatitidis, all had large amounts of the pigment melanin, which is found – among many places – in the skin of humans. People with a darker skin tone have much more of it. Melanin is known to absorb light and dissipate ultraviolet radiation, but in the fungi, it seemed to also be absorbing radiation and converting it into chemical energy for growth, perhaps in a similar fashion to how plants utilize the green pigment chlorophyll to attain energy from photosynthesis.

This photomicrograph depicts Cryptococcus neoformans using a light India ink staining preparation.

To learn more about Chernobyl's radiation-loving fungi, Jet Propulsion Laboratory researchers sent eight species collected from the area to the International Space Station (ISS) back in 2016, seeking to observe how the organisms would react. The ISS environment exposes inhabitants to between 40 and 80 times more radiation than on Earth. Researchers behind the effort hoped that the fungi would produce molecules that could be adapted into drugs that could be given to astronauts to protect them from radiation on long-term missions. Results of the experiment have yet to be published.

Back on Earth, Dadachova noted in a 2008 paper that Chernobyl's radiation-loving fungi are almost certainly not the first examples of their kind.

""Large quantities of highly melanized fungal spores have been found in early Cretaceous period deposits when many species of animals and plants died out. This period coincides with Earth’s crossing the “magnetic zero” resulting in the loss of its “shield” against cosmic radiation.""

This raises an intriguing possibility – perhaps there are places in the cosmos where melanin-containing organisms thrive in environments awash in radiation? Wherever there is energy to be harvested, life might just find a way...",https://www.realclearscience.com/blog/2020/02/04/fungi_that_eats_radiation_is_growing_on_the_walls_of_chernobyls_ruined_nuclear_reactor.html
911 calls from the chronically ill drop after Milwaukee launches community paramedic initiative,Milwaukee Fire Department implemented a mobile health care unit to assist their chronic callers. 911 calls from those 100 people dropped by 62% in two years.,1.0,"Frequent 911 calls from chronically ill city residents have dropped significantly since the launch of an effort by the Milwaukee Fire Department to help those residents better manage their health conditions.

The Community Paramedic Mobile Integrated Healthcare Program began as a pilot project in the fall of 2015 after an analysis by the department revealed that 7% of the 62,763 calls for emergency medical services the year before — 4,288 responses — came from the same 100 people.

Once the program was initiated, from October to December 2015, calls from such patients who participated fell 26%.

In 2016 those calls fell by 56%, and fell by 62% in 2017, fire department officials said.

""I see it first-hand. People are getting better,"" said Capt. Michael Wright, mobile integrated health care coordinator for the department, who spearheaded the project.

Wright was among about 100 people who gathered Friday at the fire department's downtown Station 2 to herald the accomplishments of the program.

Since its launch, about 300 patients have participated in mobile integrated health care in rotating groups of 30 during 30-day periods, Wright said.

The program involves home visits by paramedics who receive 200 hours of managed care training from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee College of Nursing, in collaboration with the Medical College of Wisconsin.

That comes on top of the 2,000 hours of paramedic training they have already received, according to Milwaukee Fire Department Chief Mark Rohlfing.

The paramedics assess the health of patients with conditions such as asthma, congestive heart failure or diabetes, with the goal of preventing chronic health issues from escalating to expensive trips to emergency rooms.

The paramedics help connect those patients with medical services and identify and address other social obstacles to medical care, such as transportation to a doctor's office.

""The goal is better health and better care at a lower cost,"" Rohlfing said.

The paramedics also check smoke alarms and carbon monoxide detectors, promote firearms safety and look for other hazards, such as ""slip and fall"" areas in the home.

There are 34 community paramedics trained in managed care working with patients participating in the program at no cost.

""We had no blueprint to follow,"" the chief said.

""The best practices hadn't been developed. The program we've built is one of a kind,"" he said.

In 2017 state legislation was passed granting the paramedics legal authorization to function in non-emergency environments, and the project received legal authorization to operate as a full-fledged program, fire department officials said.

""We're serving the most at-risk citizens in a proactive way,"" Rohlfing said.",https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/2018/04/13/911-calls-chronically-ill-drop-after-milwaukee-launches-community-paramedic-initiative/511123002/?from=new-cookie
Aquariums report wave of webcam visits amid Covid shutdown,Aquariums report high number of webcam visits amid Covid shutdown from people seeking stress relief,1.0,"Aquariums closed to visitors because of the coronavirus pandemic have reported big increases in traffic to their exhibit webcams as people turn to the underwater world for stress relief.

Since Monterey Bay aquarium in California closed to the public in March, visits to its website have tripled compared to the previous year. Nearly 80% of traffic goes to its 10 live webcams, with the sea otter, jellyfish and shark exhibits proving the most popular.

“People watch them religiously,” said Dana Allen-Greil, Monterey Bay aquarium’s director of digital strategy. “They email us and say ‘I eat breakfast every morning with the sea otters’ – it becomes part of their daily life.”

Georgia aquarium recorded an approximate 3,000% increase in daily traffic to its webcams at the start of lockdown in mid-March, in particular to its 6.3m-gallon whale shark tunnel.

A spokeswoman for the National aquarium in Baltimore said it saw “a large spike” to its blacktip reef shark, coral reef and jellyfish live streams, with anecdotal evidence that visitors were seeking stress relief.

Laura Reeve, a middle-school teacher in Santa Cruz, CA, said she had incorporated Monterey Bay aquarium’s webcams into her suggested self-care routines for students, alongside breathing exercises.

“Students were worried and anxious, and quite a few of them told me that watching the webcams helped them focus and calm down.”

Teachers had found them helpful too, Reeve said: “I regularly use the Open Ocean and Bay View webcams myself to help with relaxation.”

Research by the National Marine aquarium, the University of Plymouth and the University of Exeter published in the Environment & Behavior journal in 2015 found that viewing aquarium displays led to noticeable reductions in blood pressure and heart rate.

The study’s authors said it was the first robust evidence that “doses” of exposure to underwater settings could have a positive impact on people’s wellbeing.

A more recent review of aquariums’ restorative role, in 2018, concluded: “In today’s increasingly stressful world, quick and easy access to restorative environments that promote positive emotions and help reduce stress may be essential, especially for people who have few, if any, chances to engage with the natural world.”

During the Covid-19 shutdown, Monterey Bay aquarium has embraced this as a public service, producing a series of guided meditations – or “MeditOceans” – set to soothing footage of jellyfish or breaking waves.

“It just felt like the right thing to put out in the world,” said Allen-Greil, adding that she had been told of frontline hospital workers incorporating it into their workdays.

Monterey Bay has also recognised the boom in working from home with its own instrumental music mixes: “two hours of squid to work/study/relax to”. (Its jellyfish webcam, meanwhile, was highlighted on Reddit as one of “the best links to click while you’re stoned”.)

With 1 million followers on Facebook and now 100,000 subscribers on YouTube, social media has long been central to the aquarium’s mission to inspire ocean conservation. Its first webcams were installed in 2001.

But with no date set for reopening, Monterey Bay’s only presence during the pandemic is online, and at a time of great financial need. “It’s a lot of pressure right now to be the public face of the aquarium,” said Allen-Greil.

The institution is facing a $45m (£34m) shortfall this year and 174 staff have already lost their jobs: “We have needed more than ever this summer to use these tools for fundraising and to make clear our need.”

Monterey Bay’s call for its followers to appeal for emergency congressional funding for aquariums yielded 10,000 responses, as well as $27,000 in direct giving.

The aquarium has been exploring new potential sources of revenue, such as educational talks held in the world of the game Animal Crossing, live-streamed over Twitch; and YouTube tours behind the scenes of the jellyfish and cephalopod exhibits.

“We’ve got a ton of requests like, ‘Can you just Zoom my grandmother on her birthday and feed a penguin? I’ll pay’,” said Allen-Greil. “We’re thinking a lot about what that means for us.”

Though online initiatives alone would not save the aquarium, she said, “once we’re ready to open, we’re confident that we’ll have people wanting to come.”

Until then: “it’s about bringing the ocean to people in their daily lives.”

Coronavirus vaccination to be given for free in Japan,"Members of the public in Japan will be given a dose of vaccine against the novel coronavirus for free, according to a health ministry policy approved Friday by its advisory panel, in a bid to curb serious and fatal cases of infection",1.0,"Members of the public in Japan will be given a dose of vaccine against the novel coronavirus for free, according to a health ministry policy approved Friday by its advisory panel, in a bid to curb serious and fatal cases of infection.

The policy addresses the first dose for everyone amid uncertainty at this stage over how many times a vaccine would need to be administered.

Whether the policy will cover foreign residents in Japan has yet to be officially determined, a ministry official said, while offering his personal opinion that it would be natural to include them for the sake of public health.

The government is trying to secure enough vaccines by the first half of 2021 to administer to all members of the public, having earmarked a budget of ¥671.4 billion ($6.4 billion).

It has agreed with British drugmaker AstraZeneca PLC and U.S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc. to receive 120 million doses of vaccine from each company when successfully developed, and is also negotiating with U.S. firm Moderna Inc. for 40 million doses or more.

Dentist transforms the teeth of those living in poverty free of charge with his 'smile factory',Dentist who gives free smile makeovers to Brazil's poorest people proudly reveals their life-changing transformations in heart-rending before and after photos,1.0,"Advertisement

A dentist who travels to underprivileged communities to give people dental makeovers free of charge is, quite literally, bringing bright and healthy smiles to the faces of people all over the world.

Keen to give back and do good, aesthetic dentist Felipe Rossi formed an NGO called Por1sorriso to provide free dental work to low-income people in need of root canals, cleaning, restoration work and more.

The Brazil-native, 38, said that his team can perform up to 1,500 dental procedures during a typical 'action' in a village or town; providing invaluable services for communities who need it most.

Life changing: Dentist Felipe Rossi has shared remarkable before and after images of his patients, many of whom live in extreme poverty and cannot afford dental work

Emotional: The before-and-after photos are powerfully emotive, and capture the raw reactions to their new smiles

Life altering: Felipe said the work that he and his team do is 'transformative' - as he estimates that they have provided free dental care to 1,500 people so far

Felipe also serves as the Director of Fundraising for Por1sorriso and while the NGO boasts up to 4,000 registered volunteers, the reality can be quite difference due to the cost of the undertaking.

Doing good: Felipe, pictured, has an NGO that provides dental work for residents of low-income communities

He recently told R7 news that each five-day mission in Brazil, which generally takes place in town halls, schools or theaters, will cost up to R $ 20,000 ($4,974).

Sponsorship generally comes from two private companies and, recently, from oral hygiene brand Colgate.

Individuals can also donate through the 'Smile Solidarity' program, choosing monthly amounts to donate and Por1sorriso hosts regular fund-raising events to keep up with the cost of continuing the free dental service around the country.

(The Federal Council of Dentistry estimates that about 20 million Brazilians have never been to the dentist.)

'There are costs that people have to bear and, with that, many people end up giving up on the action,' Felipe said of the volunteers.

On Instagram, Felipe routinely calls out how restricted access to dental care is.

He also admitted how Por1sorriso is 'struggling to survive' because of the expense of the dental work and the constant fundraising required.

After all, he said, the assistance that his 'social project' Por1sorriso provides is 'very different from projects where people simply get toothbrushes and toothpaste'.

Young again: A recent patient who Felipe treated in March looks generations younger thanks to her healthy smile

Change: Writing on Instagram of this woman, Felipe said, 'If we change the life of one person, everything will be worth it'

Smile factory: Felipe jokes that the NGO is like a smile factory; delivering makeovers to people all over Brazil

Communities: Felipe travels throughout Brazil and Africa to help people in neighborhoods who are unable to access dental care

Sharing a photo of a young woman who was given a dental makeover earlier this month, Felipe said 'I didn't do dentistry to take care of teeth, but to take care of people'.

'Awakening smiles, without business relationship, just for love, connects us with something bigger,' he said. 'One day, [a] smile will be for everyone and tears will fall with joy, just for being able to smile.'

The photo shows the woman in tears of happiness as she sees her new smile for the first time.

Of the transformations, Felipe also said: 'Our actions are worth more than words; building a better world is not done with syllables and verb conjugations. Doing is a transformative act.

Referring to Brazil he added: 'The country with the largest number of dentists in the world also has one of the biggest social inequalities and segregating dentistry.

'Millions don't know what sitting in a dental chair is like. It's time to wake up ... it's time to smile.'

So far, Felipe and the team have visited Africa nine times.

He jokes that Por1sorriso is something of a 'smile factory', delivering aesthetic makeovers with a deeper meaning everywhere the team goes.

Below are some of the most incredible and heartwarming transformations that Por1sorriso has provided in Africa and Brazil.

Small changes: Sometimes the work required is not as drastic as total restoration as patients might need just a clean or check up

A whole smile! One man was given a full set of new teeth, giving him a dramatic new appearance

Replacement: A woman looks over the moon with her new smile after being given replacement teeth by the team

Drastic: Some of the dental makeovers, such as this man's, are dramatic

Hygiene: Felipe lamented how disparate people's access to basic dental care is, which further propels him to continue providing services for free

Child: Patients of all ages from challenged socio-economic backgrounds have benefited from Por1sorriso's work

Help: Por1sorriso has provided dental work to people of all ages and all over the world, including this child in Africa",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-7631493/Dentist-transforms-teeth-living-poverty-free-charge-smile-factory.html

About five years since the war in eastern Ukraine between government forces and Russian-backed separatists began, triggering a surge in propaganda and disinformation, some students in four cities across the country are learning how to better assess what they're reading, seeing and hearing.

A report released Friday by global education organization IREX says that students in 8th and 9th grades were better able to identify false information and hate speech after teachers integrated the organization's media literacy techniques into their lessons.

Students were twice as likely to detect hate speech and 18 percent better at identifying fake news than students who missed out on those lessons, according to the report.

The Learn to Discern program, funded by the U.S. and U.K. embassies in Ukraine, was tested in 50 schools, including in the eastern city of Mariupol which saw major fighting in the war's first years.

A group of fact checkers, journalists and teachers wove the training into some 15 existing lesson plans.

Teachers didn't all include the same techniques in their programs. Between September and December 2018, students might have analyzed the implications of word choices in a Ukrainian literature class, or study doctored videos in their art classes — and they might not have even realized they were receiving media literacy training.

""We go into how a given photo could be taken from a movie and then with captions be altered to represent a certain situation or conflict,"" Mehri Druckman, IREX's country representative in Ukraine, tells NPR. Students were taught how to check and double check images that could have been manipulated, she adds. ""Sometimes it would be as simple as understanding how to do a reverse image search, or if we have time, to go into photo forensics.""

IREX says that kids who received the modified lessons performed better in all media-analysis skills, such as distinguishing facts and opinions, identifying hate speech, and noticing where information had been omitted.

Girls gained more knowledge than boys. ""The girls did better at separating fact from opinions, on news media knowledge and on analysis skills,"" says Druckman. ""Why is that? We're trying to understand that more deeply ourselves.""

IREX plans to do further research to try to understand the better performance by girls.

One open-ended survey question, posed to students as the semester concluded, inspired teachers, she said. It asked kids to describe the most memorable lesson of their semester and why. Students most often referred to lessons that had been injected with media literacy education.

Still, IREX's head of Media and Information Literacy Initiatives Katya Vogt says, ""We are ten years too late.""

The organization began Ukraine's Learn to Discern program in 2015, after Russia's annexation of Crimea. Staff initially started teaching adults across the country how to detect disinformation and propaganda before turning to younger generations.

Druckman says that by 2021, the program will be used in approximately 650 schools across Ukraine.

""Often places that are the most vulnerable [to disinformation] are where large social divisions are being actively exploited by bad actors,"" Mike Caulfield, who is leading a national digital literacy initiative for the American Association of State Colleges and Universities, tells NPR. That makes the training ""more politically delicate.""

Caulfield is not connected with the IREX initiative.

He says there is a risk that ""folk knowledge about truth and authority on the Internet"" gets passed down to younger generations. In his own experience, students struggle the most with assessing media, not when they lack a strategy, but when they apply bad strategies they've been taught.

As soon as teachers introduce digital tools to students in the classroom, they should begin teaching some digital strategies, Caulfield says. But there is a dearth of organizations coordinating such efforts in the United States, he adds.

More money should be spent on training teachers to integrate media and web literacy in their lessons, Caulfield says.

""The takeaway is, let's have a real national discussion about how to do this right in the United States.""",https://www.npr.org/2019/03/22/705809811/students-in-ukraine-learn-how-to-spot-fake-stories-propaganda-and-hate-speech

Teenager delivers hundreds of solar lamps to Puerto Ricans living without power,Teenager delivers hundreds of solar lamps to Puerto Ricans living without power,1.0,"More than four months after Hurricane Maria ravaged Puerto Rico, 15-year-old Salvador Gomez Colon is shocked by the poor living conditions that persist in many of the towns throughout the island.

""There is so much need,"" said Gomez Colon. ""People are still shoveling debris around their homes. With no power, the elderly are struggling with the heat.""

Nearly half a million of Puerto Rico's residents still don't have power. Families are living in houses with makeshift roofs made out of tarps and other materials and roads and bridges remain badly damaged.

""The farther you go from the metro areas is where you really see it,"" said Gomez Colon, who lives with his family in San Juan.

""It's very crazy to think that there are still people without power,"" he said on CNN on Saturday. ""Four months without power is an extremely traumatizing experience.""

Just days after Maria slammed Puerto Rico, the ninth grader launched a crowdfunding campaign on fundraising platform Generosity. His goal: to raise $100,000 and use the money to buy portable lamps and hand-operated washing machines for residents in the hardest hit parts of Puerto Rico.

Since that time, Gomez Colon has raised more than $125,000 and has donated 1,400 solar lamps to some 840 households. He has another 1,600 lamps that he hopes to distribute soon.

With the help of his family, friends and other volunteers, Gomez Colon started distributing the solar lamps last November through his initiative C+Feel = Hope.

""When we went to the first town that has no power, people from other towns would hear what we were doing. So we would add that town to our list for our next distribution,"" he said.

The teenager visits these communities on the weekends. He's seen schoolkids studying in the hot sun, rushing to finish their homework before the daylight disappears.

In one town, Gomez Colon met a young woman sitting outside reading Homer's Illiad. ""She told me she couldn't read at night because there's no light,"" he said.

So he handed her a portable solar lamp.

""I told her she didn't have to worry about rushing through the book in the heat,"" he said. ""For the first time in three months, she was going to be able to read it at night.""

CNNMoney first interviewed Gomez Colon in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Maria in September. At the time, he was hunkered down with his family in their San Juan apartment. The family was rationing the food and water they had stored before the storm hit. Still, the teenager knew he was better off than many others on the island.

With his mother's help, he sought a nonprofit organization to partner with and launched his online campaign.

As the money came in, Gomez Colon contacted makers of portable solar lamps and washing machines. To date, he's secured close to 300 hand-powered washing machines from companies like Gentlewasher and EasyGo and more than 3,000 lamps -- including some that have mobile phone charging capabilities -- from Mpowerd, Schneider Electric and Omnivoltaic Energy Solutions, among other companies.

Related: Nearly half a million in Puerto Rico still in the dark four months after Hurricane Maria

Last week, he led the first distribution of the hand-operated washing machines to families in Naranjito, a town located in central Puerto Rico. ""Every weekend that we've gone for a distribution has made me feel so good,"" he said. ""But it's complicated. We are helping people, but there are just so many others also in need.""

According to the most recent tally from Puerto Rico's government, about 80% of the island has had power restored, 96% has access to running water and almost 98% now has telecom services.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency said it was halting new shipments of food and water to the island as of Wednesday, an agency official with direct knowledge of the plan told CNN.

In a statement, the agency said that ""FEMA-provided commodities are no longer needed for emergency operations."" The agency also noted it has more than 46 million liters of water, two million Meals Ready to Eat and two million snack packs on the ground in Puerto Rico ready for distribution if needed.

Still, hundreds of thousands of residents remain in the dark, according to Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority.

Loubriel Vega, 34, a fire inspector with the fire department in San Juan, is one of them. He lives with his three young children in Morovis, a town 38 miles outside of San Juan.

The family has running water, but has not had power, Internet or consistent cellphone service since September. Hurricane Maria also badly damaged the roof of his house.

Vega received two solar lamps through Gomez Colon's effort. He said the lamps have been immensely helpful for simple things like cooking and helping his kids and disabled family members move around the house at night.

""We need power badly,"" he said. ""Without it, how do we run our fridges and freezers and keep our food safe?""

Gomez Colon said he will keep going until either the money runs out or people no longer need the lamps and washing machines. People can still contribute to the campaign, he added.

""This experience has taught me to be grateful for what I have. My family supports me, my teachers support me,"" he said. ""The world can always benefit from a positive mission. So I have to take this to the end.""",http://money.cnn.com/2018/02/01/news/economy/puerto-rico-teen-solar-lamps-power/index.html
New York City Reports No COVID Deaths in 24 Hours,New York City Reports No COVID Deaths in 24 Hours,1.0,"New York City, once the center of the U.S. COVID-19 outbreak, has had its first 24-hour period with no coronavirus deaths.

""This disease is far from beaten,” said Mayor Bill de Blasio on Monday, the first day without any reported COVID deaths since the first case was reported March 1.

“We look around the country and we see what so many other Americans are going through, so many other states and cities hurting so bad right now,” said de Blasio. “So, no one can celebrate, but we can at least take a moment to appreciate that every one of you did so much to get us to this point – 24 hours where no one died. Let's have many more days like that.""

De Blasio says he is particularly concerned about the growing number of people in their 20s contracting the coronavirus. He urged them to wear masks and social distance.

“I understand for so many younger adults, it has been a really difficult time — cooped up, disconnected, away from loved ones ... and I understand that people are just yearning to break out from that,” said de Blasio, who added that young people have to realize that everyone is vulnerable.

Also Monday, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo issued an emergency health order that requires visitors from states with high rates of COVID-19 to provide information about their in-state accommodations or face a penalty of up to $2,000, “If you fail to provide it, you will receive a summons with a $2000 fine. We’re serious about enforcing quarantine,” the governor tweeted.

NY is issuing an emergency health order:

Last week, he tweeted the 19 states: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Utah.

One of them, Florida, reported its second-highest total number of cases for a single day, a day after setting the record for most new cases for a single day, 15,300. During the height of the New York outbreak, the worst day high was 12, 274 cases.

In California Governor Gavin Newsom Monday extended the closure of bars, restaurants, gyms, churches, and amusement centers from 19 counties to the entire state.

“The data suggests not everybody is practicing common sense,” Newsom said as the number of new cases began rising since some businesses began reopening in May.

In Maryland, three immigration courts reopened Monday in Baltimore while the U.S. Justice Department reported a backlog of more than 1 million cases.

No spectators or relatives were allowed in the courtroom, and everyone entering the buildings was required to wear a mask.

Courts in other cities began to hear cases in mid-June.

Immigration courts across the country suspended all non-deportation and non-detention-related hearings in March when the coronavirus outbreak began.

But some judges and lawyers have balked at returning to the courts, saying they don’t feel safe. They note that many immigration hearing rooms are small and wedged into federal office buildings instead of conventional courthouses with large rooms.

Canada’s largest province, Ontario, will continue to ease restrictions later this week.

Starting Friday, indoor gatherings will grow from a 10-person limit to 50 people. Outdoor gatherings of up to 100 people will be allowed as long as participants remain 2 meters apart. Gyms, movie theaters and restaurants will reopen.

But Toronto will be the exception and many closings and limits on gatherings in Canada’s largest city will stay in place for now.

A woman in Heilongjiang Province, China, spread COVID-19 to an estimated 71 people simply by riding in an elevator, according to a research letter published Monday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

According to the CDC, the 25-year-old woman returned to China from the U.S. in mid-March and was quarantined in her home. After others in her apartment building became sick, researchers tested the woman based on her travel and concluded she was an asymptomatic COVID-19 carrier and had started the spread by infecting at least one of her neighbors in the elevator.

Researchers say this case shows how even a single case of the disease can result in ""widespread community transmission.""

Wearing face masks in supermarkets and stores in England will be mandatory starting next week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s office announced Monday.

Face coverings are already required on buses and subways in London and other English cities. Other European countries, including Germany, Greece, Italy and Spain already require face coverings in stores.

As Disney prepares to close both of its Anaheim theme parks over coronavirus concerns, the Disneyland Resort announced Friday that it will donate its excess food inventory to a local food bank.

The donation, to Second Harvest Food Bank of Orange County, will include dairy, fruit, vegetables, packaged goods and banquet meals, according to a post on the Disney Parks blog.

Disney emphasized that food safety guidelines will be “closely followed” as its excess stores are supplied to the organization.

The resort has operated a food donation program since 2014. The program regularly sends prepared, unserved meals from certain locations to help food insecure individuals in the local community.

Second Harvest Food Bank received more than 20,000 donated meals from Disneyland Resort last year, according to the blog post. Disney employees also regularly volunteer at the non-profit, which is working to end hunger in Orange County.

More than 290,000 people in the county are at risk of hunger every month, including one out of every six children, according to the organization.

Disneyland and Disney California Adventure are set to close Saturday in response to the burgeoning coronavirus outbreak. Both parks will be shut down through at least the end of the month.

Banker picks up college tuition for entire school class ... AGAIN!,"Local Banker pays college tuition for graduating high school students, ""because it's the right thing to do."" (x-post r/news)",1.0,"The Luck Public Schools confirmed for KARE 11 that that Dennis Frandsen -- a self-made success who now has 35 branches of Frandsen Bank and Trust in communities across Minnesota and Wisconsin -- offered to pay for two years of technical college for all of Luck's 34 prospective graduates this year.

LUCK, Wis. - Few would question the generosity of a man who promised to pick up the cost of a two-year degree for an entire high school class.

There should be no doubts now, after businessman Dennis Frandsen extended the same offer to each and every student of the 2019 graduating class in Luck, Wisconsin.

The Luck Public Schools confirmed for KARE 11 that that Frandsen -- a self-made success who now has 35 branches of Frandsen Bank and Trust in communities across Minnesota and Wisconsin -- offered to pay for two years of technical college for all of Luck's 34 prospective graduates this year. A planning meeting to explain to parents how the program will work will be held in October.

Luck Public Schools Superintendent Cory Hinkel told the students about Frandsen's generous gesture during an assembly Tuesday on the first day of school. ""The look on the kids' faces was priceless,"" Hinkel recalled. ""I really think this is going to make a huge impact on a lot of our kids' lives.""

Frandsen tells KARE 11 he was born in Luck and spent a year going to high school in the town before transferring to nearby Frederic because the bus routes were better. He maintains his roots in the community, having purchased the farmstead his father once owned and opening a bank branch in Luck as well.

The successful businessman says he regularly attends high school graduations and noted that nearly all the scholarships go to the very top students in each class. Frandsen decided it would be his mission to spread the wealth... and opportunity... around a bit.

""What about the average students?"" he asks hypothetically, noting he was an average high school student at best. ""Are we just going to forget about them?""

Last year KARE 11's Boyd Huppert profiled Frandsen after he made the same offer to the 59-member graduating class at Rush City High School. “I thought it was the right thing to do,” Frandsen told Boyd in the installment of ""Land of 10,000 Stories."" “I was able to do it and why shouldn't I.” In fact, Frandsen decided he would make the same two-year scholarship offer to Rush City's class of 2019 as well.

Luck superintendent Hinkel thinks the gesture is far more reaching than Frandsen's modesty would allow him to admit. In a small community where not all families and students have the resources to easily pursue higher education, the promise of two years of tuition is huge.

""This just opens up doors for those whose doors may have been closed a little harder,"" Hinkel says.

"Govt proposes to buy bulk subscriptions of all scientific journals, provide free access to all","Indian Govt proposes to buy bulk subscriptions of all scientific journals, provide free access to all.",1.0,"All data generated from publicly-funded research is proposed to be made freely available to everyone. (Representational Image)

In an ambitious move to make scientific knowledge and data available to all, the government has proposed an open data policy that will make information generated by all publicly funded research, including its results, freely accessible to everyone.

More significantly, the government has also proposed to buy bulk subscriptions of all the important scientific journals across the world, and provide everyone in India free access to them. The proposals have been made in the draft Science, Technology and Innovation Policy that was released to the public on New Year’s Day for comments and suggestions.

The ‘One Nation, One Subscription’ policy for scientific journals is a radical move that could prove to be a game changer for the scientific community and individual researchers. There are more than 3,000 to 4,000 high-impact scientific journals, and sources say the government might have to spend a few hundred crore rupees every year to get their bulk subscriptions. But its impact on the scientific research community could be huge, given that access to these journals are highly priced and even big institutions are selective in buying subscriptions.

The Ministry of Science and Technology, which has drafted the new policy, proposes to set up a new Science, Technology and Innovation Observatory which will serve as a central repository for all kinds of data generated from research in India. All data generated from publicly-funded research is proposed to be made freely available to everyone. In cases where, for reasons of privacy, national security or intellectual property rights, the availability of data has to be restricted, “suitably anonymised and/or redacted data” will still be provided. Even in cases where it cannot be released to the general public, genuine researchers would be given access to it, the policy has proposed.

Additionally, libraries of all publicly-funded institutions are proposed to be made accessible to general public “subject only to reasonable security protocols”.

The policy also talks about promoting the goal of “Atmanirbhar Bharat” in the field of science and technology. “A two-way approach of indigenous development of technology as well as technology indigenisation will be adopted,” it says.

“Greater emphasis will be given on promoting traditional knowledge systems, developing indigenous technologies and encouraging grassroots innovations,” it says.",https://indianexpress.com/article/india/pune/one-nation-one-subscription-govt-draft-policy-7128799/

Why is Mister Rogers making adults cry decades later?,"'I think he would be proud of me' : Viewers explain why they can't stop crying during the Mister Rogers movie trailer, and how he shaped their lives",1.0,"If people are crying this much watching fewer than three minutes of Won't You Be My Neighbor?, watch out for the waterworks when the full documentary opens Thursday with a block party at Tampa Theatre and in limited release around the United States.

Oscar-winning director Morgan Neville's film about Fred Rogers, beloved host of PBS kids show Mister Rogers' Neighborhood from 1968 to 2001, has picked up good reviews at festival screenings, but from the moment the first trailer went online in March, many who watched it did so through teary eyes.

The film covers Rogers' decades-long mission to make television a tool for helping children, stressing love, community and acceptance. He refused to talk down to kids when making episodes on divorce, death and even assassination in the wake of Robert Kennedy's death.

But why all the crying? It's not like we haven't had time to mourn the loss of the sweatered one, who died in 2003 at 74. Adults did take it hard at the time, though. Bonnie Smalley, 33, of Boulder, Colo., remembers it being her freshman year at West Chester University in Pennsylvania.

""When my dorm got notice that he died, we all gathered in the common area and put on old episodes someone had taped on VHS,"" she said. It was ""definitely a group therapy type deal.""

The sight of something from your childhood can make you emotional, but Rogers seems to cut deeper, and across a wide range of people. His show, produced in Pittsburgh, was viewed by a whopping 8 percent of U.S. households at its peak in 1985, according to Pittsburgh Magazine.

We tracked down people from around the country, including those

who commented on YouTube, Twitter or Reddit that the trailer made them cry. Fifteen years after Rogers' death, we asked what he meant

to them.

Dunn was in Army Ranger school, away from any phones or TVs, but the instructor came into the barracks and announced ""Mister Rogers died today."" Someone in the corner laughed, and started retelling the untrue urban legend that Rogers was a Marine sniper who'd had 50 kills. The rest of the barracks immediately shut the man down and fell completely silent in respect. He remembers a couple of guys going into the latrine and coming back with bloodshot eyes.

Fifteen years later, ""I cried when I watched the trailer,"" Dunn said. ""More people should."" For him, Rogers ""was a father figure in a home without one, a peaceful man in times that weren't so peaceful and someone who treated kids with respect, which sometimes was in short supply.""

Witecki is marketing and communications director for Tampa Theatre, one of a handful of theaters premiering the film this week.

""I've watched the trailer several times now, and get emotional every time. I've been trying to pinpoint why. Had you asked before I knew we were getting the movie, what I remembered about Mister Rogers, I would have mentioned the Land of Make Believe, the trolley, him putting on his sneakers. Watching it now I realize the lasting impact has nothing to do with those little details, and everything to do with growing up learning from that show to love yourself, love your neighbor, and learning that it's okay to be sad or angry and feel those emotions.

""I think maybe it just really hits me that, in today's climate of divisiveness, and now that I have a 2?½-year-old daughter, I wonder who is that Mister Rogers now. Who's the person today filling that role for children?""

The online community the Church of Rogers jokingly describes itself as ""followers of Rogerism who believe that Mister Rogers is a holy figure."" In reality, it's just a tongue-in-cheek name, but Poag said there's a grain of truth in it.

""I don't think there's a word in the English language for that feeling,"" he said, when asked why Rogers makes people cry. He theorized it has something to do with realizing you're an adult, but have failed to live the Neighborhood ideals. That you've somehow ""let your neighborhood down."" ""In Mister Rogers, we can see virtue, we can even feel it ... but we just can't seem to get there ourselves.""

THE STATE YOU'RE IN: Mister Rogers found his calling in Florida

Williams said her parents were mostly absent and abusive, and that Mister Rogers was a ""surrogate parent"" for her, ""as I'm sure he was with many others."" Her world was filled with chaos, but the world where Rogers came in every day and changed from his suit to a cardigan and sneakers provided a little stability.

""I promised myself if I ever had children of my own, I would parent them in a way where they would feel the same way Mister Rogers made me feel, safe and worthy and joyful. I did that. I have two beautiful children who are funny and awesome. I broke the cycle of generational abuse in no small part due to Mister Rogers. I genuinely feel if he were alive today he would be really proud of me for that.""

The high school English teacher who ""straight up sobbed"" during the trailer said she grew up in Louisiana exposed to bigotry, hatred and racism. Mister Rogers was ""revolutionary"" for her with his sensitivity, acceptance and songs like It's You I Like.

""I remember one thing that always blew my mind was that he never yelled. Men in my life were always yelling and so ... to me, Mister Rogers seemed like magic.""

Now in the classroom she chooses texts that will inspire empathy and guides her students to reflect on their feelings. ""Trying to teach kindness to kids is so radical and scary and infuriating and difficult, but Mister Rogers showed that it's possible ... and I think he would be proud of me.""

Long, author of 2015's Peaceful Neighbor: Discovering the Countercultural Mister Rogers, calls Rogers a ""radical"" for teaching pacifism while the United States was at war, using the show to break down gender norms and racial barriers, and for Rogers' vegetarianism on moral grounds.

Maybe the emotional reaction has something to with living in a time when things feel so chaotic, and technology spreads our attention thin. He said that watching Mister Rogers' Neighborhood while researching the book made him totally present in the moment.

""Rogers had a gift for slowing the clock, demanding us to be here and now, for quieting the noise of our everyday lives."" Rogers was an ordained Presbyterian minister, ""but in some ways, it seems as if Rogers sought to transform us into Zen Buddhist monks, present, quiet and peaceful.""

Alabama newspaper editor who urged Klan to 'ride again' replaced by African-American woman,"The editor of an Alabama newspaper who recently urged the Ku Klux Klan to ""ride again"" has been replaced by an African-American woman",1.0,"(CNN) An African-American woman is now the publisher and editor of the Alabama newspaper that recently urged the Ku Klux Klan to ""night ride again,"" the paper said.

Elecia R. Dexter, a ""strategic leader with expertise in human resources, operations and change management,"" took up the positions Thursday, the weekly Democrat-Reporter of Linden said in a press release.

Dexter replaces Goodloe Sutton, the newspaper's owner who penned a staggering editorial with the headline "" The Klan Needs to Ride Again "" in the paper's February 14 edition.

Sutton still owns the newspaper, Dexter told CNN.

Goodloe Sutton, former editor and publisher of The Democrat-Reporter, in an undated photo.

Dexter's family has ""strong roots and a rich history in Marengo County where her dad, John Dexter Jr. was born,"" the newspaper said.

Sutton's editorial sparked outrage around the country. ""Time for the Ku Klux Klan to night ride again,"" Sutton wrote. ""Democrats in the Republican Party and Democrats are plotting to raise taxes in Alabama.""

Sutton told the Montgomery Advertiser he urged the white supremacist group to ""clean out D.C."" via lynchings. ""We'll get the hemp ropes out, loop them over a tall limb and hang all of them,"" Sutton told the newspaper.

He stressed that he wasn't calling for the hangings of all Americans, just the ""socialist-communists.""

""Seem like the Klan would be welcome to raid the gated communities up there,"" Sutton wrote in the editorial.

Beginning in the late 19th century, Klan members used night rides to terrorize blacks and their white allies with violence, including lynchings and firebombings.

When asked by the Advertiser if he recognized the Klan as a white supremacist group, Sutton compared it to the NAACP and said, ""The Klan wasn't violent until they needed to be.""

'Good riddance,' US senator tweets

US Sen. Doug Jones, D-Alabama, had called for Sutton to resign. On Friday, he applauded the change at the paper.

""Good riddance Goodloe,"" Jones said on Twitter . ""His dangerous views do not represent Alabama or the small-town papers in Alabama that do great work every day.

""The good people of Linden deserve so much better than these racist rants and I am confident they will get it with new editor, Elecia Dexter.""

Another Democratic lawmaker from Alabama who had called for Sutton's resignation, US Rep. Terri Sewell, tweeted late Friday that she wants him to take another step.

""Mr. Sutton has made a lot of poor decisions but stepping down is the right thing to do. Now, he must apologize,"" Sewell tweeted.

The school added that it ""strongly condemns Mr. Sutton's remarks as they are antithetical to all that we value as scholars of journalism, the media, and human communication.""

Auburn University's Journalism Advisory Council also stripped Sutton of its 2009 distinguished community journalism award following a Tuesday vote.

This is the editorial that ran in the Democrat-Reporter newspaper on February 14.

Newspaper has courted controversy before

Linden is a town of about 2,000 people in west-central Alabama. Sutton told USA Today in 2015 that The Democrat-Reporter's circulation, once more than 7,000, had fallen to about 3,000 subscribers.

The Klan piece isn't the first controversial editorial in the pages of the newspaper.

In October 2017, the paper published an editorial about the controversy over NFL players kneeling during the National Anthem to protest police brutality and racial injustice.

""Some of the news programs are making a big to-do about black football players kneeling in the stadium,"" the editorial said. ""That's what black folks were taught to do two hundred years ago, kneel before a white man.""

A July 2016 editorial mocked President Barack Obama, calling him ""the Kenyan King,"" and complained about the ""way uncivilized tribes in Africa still run things.""

In April, the paper ran a political cartoon that ridiculed Palestinians.

Alabama husband saves wife's life by donating kidney after losing 100lbs,Husband saves wife's life by donating kidney after spending a year dieting and exercising to get his blood pressure low enough for surgery,1.0,"A man has spent a year losing 70lbs so he could donate his kidney to his wife.

PJ Spraggins was delighted when he discovered he was a perfect match for wife Tracy, who was told her life-long battle with Lupus would kill her if she didn't get a transplant. The waiting list is seven years long.

But the next day the couple from Birmingham, Alabama, were dealt a blow: his blood pressure was too high to perform the operation.

Refusing to accept the diagnosis, PJ embarked on a relentless fitness regime.

Finally, in December 2014, they got the green light. In February, they went under the knife together.

Transformation: PJ and Tracy Spraggins (pictured, left, in 2006, and right in 2015) together lost 145lbs in one year so he could donate his kidney to her. On the transplant list, she would have had to wait seven years

Made it! After a year of grueling dieting and exercise, PJ was given the green light to undergo surgery

'We both just feel amazing. I'm slowly getting back to work making music, Tracy is making sure she fully recovers. But the entire process has been amazing.'

Now 39, Tracy was six when she was first diagnosed with the chronic inflammatory disease which affects her kidney functions.

She was placed on the transplant list in 2013 - just a few months after her 34-year-old sister, who also had Lupus, died following complications from a kidney transplant.

Knowing that the seven-year wait might be too long, PJ, a self-employed musician, submitted himself for the weeks-long evaluation to assess whether he could donate his kidney.

Journey: For a year, he kept losing weight and going in for tests, only to be told he needed to lose more

Finally, he visited Nashville's Vanderbilt hospital in December 2014, and the numbers all matched up

However, the good news was tinged with disappointment as doctors said his size meant the operation couldn't go ahead.

'They said I was a perfect match but they wanted to check I was healthy and met their requirements. They sent me a blood pressure monitor, but they didn't like the numbers.

'That was a real kick in the gut.'

The doctors advised PJ, who weighed 265lbs, to lose 30lbs before returning for an evaluation.

He did - but on the day of the test he changed a flat tire.

'My blood pressure was all over the place. The results came back and they said no again.'

It didn't stop there.

Next try was a hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, where he was told to another 60lbs.

Eventually, they made it to Nashville's Vanderbilt Hospital in December 2014. PJ made sure he did everything he could to ensure the readings were perfect.

'I put that blood pressure monitor on and lay in bed all day. And thankfully, it all came back good!'

Undergoing the four-hour surgery together on February 24, the couple took a beaming photograph in matching hospital gowns.

Life saver: Special needs teacher Tracy, 39, has suffered from Lupus, a chronic inflammatory disease, since she was six. In 2013, doctors in Birmingham, Alabama, said she would need a kidney transplant to survive

Happy: Spraggins (pictured in hospital) described the feeling of dejection at every hurdle until they made it

Perfect match: The chances of being a perfect match for one's spouse is rare

The couple, who married in 2003, are now back home and recovering in Birmingham

GIft! This was the festive Easter gift given to Tracy and PJ by Vanderbilt hospital

'The way my kidney function is now, it's at 100 percent. And it's at the best it's ever been,' Tracy, a special needs teacher, told Fox.

PJ told DailyMail.com: 'It has just been amazing. To know that I did everything I could to give my wife a better quality of life is just the best feeling. I am so happy.'

The couple's friends have now set up a fund to financially support them during the two-month recovery period when they will be unable to work.",http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3027749/Husband-saves-wife-s-life-donating-kidney-spending-year-dieting-exercising-blood-pressure-low-surgery.html
He spent 27 years wrongly convicted of murder. He wants to spend the rest encouraging inmates to read,He spent 27 years wrongly convicted of murder. He wants to spend the rest encouraging inmates to read,1.0,"(CNN) The first book John Bunn fell in love with, curled up in his cell at a maximum-security prison in upstate New York, was Sister Souljah's novel ""The Coldest Winter Ever.""

In the book, a maternal woman advocates for the improvement of her black community in Brooklyn as she watches the people she loves suffer from the consequences of incarceration, violence and a seemingly endless cycle of poverty.

""I related to that book on so many levels,"" Bunn says.

John Bunn outside the Kingsborough Projects in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, where Robert Crosson and Rolando Neischer were carjacked and shot in August of 1991.

Bunn knows more than most what it's like to face injustice. Arrested and imprisoned as an adolescent in New York City, he spent 17 years in jail for a crime he didn't commit and a further decade on parole, fighting for his exoneration. In that time, he battled, among others, the courts, police investigators, PTSD and the challenges of illiteracy. He was 16 before he could read and write.

Today Bunn is 41 and a free man at last, mentoring at-risk young people and advocating for the power of reading through his own program that brings books to prisons.

In many ways, his own story sounds straight out of a Sister Souljah book. Except that Bunn, who survived years of wrongful incarceration with his humanity intact, is determined to write the next chapter himself.

The arrest

Bunn's ordeal began on August 14, 1991, when he was sitting in the kitchen of his mother's apartment in Crown Heights, Brooklyn.

It was 90 degrees in the shade and the AC was broken. Outside he could hear hip-hop music playing from passing cars and the thwack of basketballs on pavement as kids made their way to the courts. Bunn's mother, Maureen, was making pancakes, his two-year-old sister, India, cooing in her high chair.

Bunn, 14 years old and out of school for the summer, was ready for a typical day of playing ball and demonstrating his famous back flips in and around the four-block radius between the apartment on Ralph Street (his mom) and the house on St Marks (his grandma). Those four blocks, snug between the love of the two women who raised him, were his whole world.

John Bunn, 14, at home in Crown Heights, Brooklyn.

But then, a bang on the door. It was the police.

""They wanted to take me down to the police station for questioning,"" Bunn recalls now, sitting in that same small apartment festooned with family photos, nearly three decades later.

He was taken to Brooklyn's 77th precinct, put in a room and handcuffed to a pole.

""The interrogation was led by a detective by the name of Louis Scarcella. And he was threatening me, telling me that I was never coming home if I wouldn't tell him what he wanted to know. He also told me that they already had beat up my co-defendant, that they had slammed his head into a wall and they already had him,"" he recalls.

The co-defendant? A 17-year-old Brooklyn boy named Rosean Hargrave. Bunn knew Hargrave ""from the block,"" although he and the older boy were never more than acquaintances. But, as he soon found out, they were both now suspected of the same crime: The killing of an off-duty Rikers Island corrections officer named Rolando Neischer.

""I kept telling them, ""No, I didn't have any knowledge of it,"" Bunn recalls.

John Bunn, 14, right, and Rosean Hargrove, 17, arrested at the 77th Precinct in Brooklyn in August 1991. NYPD Detective Louis Scarcella (open jacket and loose tie) holds Bunn.

But Detective Scarcella, who worked in the Brooklyn North homicide unit for years before retiring in 1999, told the young John he did not believe him.

Bunn's eyes fill with tears as he describes the moment he was placed in a police lineup with ""grown men."" As an adult, Bunn, a slight man with a gentle disposition and a shy smile, stands only 5 feet 6 inches. At 14, he estimates he was no taller than 5-foot-2. He was so much smaller than the adults he was lined up with that the detectives had to improvise.

They brought in stools so the lineup could be done sitting down. Bunn did what he was told. He sat down and held up a number.

A couple of minutes later, Scarcella came back into the room.

""He told me, 'It was my lucky day,' that I got picked,"" Bunn says, grimacing.

""Ever since then, I've been fighting to prove my innocence,"" he says, wiping his face and adjusting his hat.

On the front of his baseball cap, in bold white letters, are the words, ""WRONGFULLY CONVICTED. On the side, ""VICTIMS OF DETECTIVE LOUIS SCARCELLA.""

The hat, he adds, ""speaks for itself.""

The night of the killing

The day before Bunn was arrested, two off-duty Rikers Island correction officers and old friends, Rolando Neischer and Robert Crosson, were sitting in a car, chatting outside the Kingsborough projects, a housing project in Crown Heights. It was about 4 a.m.

Suddenly, two men on bicycles approached the car, pointed guns and ordered the pair out of their vehicle. Crosson later described at trial how a gun then ""went off,"" the bullet ripping through his hand. He managed to get out of the car and sprinted away, losing track of his friend.

At some point, Neischer had grabbed his own firearm and fought back.

In the ensuing gunfight, before the attackers jumped in the car and drove away, Neischer was shot five times. He was found slumped against a fence, bleeding, but still alive, 192 feet from where the car had been parked.

The next day, they came for John Bunn, with Crosson identifying both him and Hargrave in police lineups. Three days after that, Neischer died from his wounds.

On the night Neischer and Crosson were carjacked, Bunn had no inkling of what was to come. But his mother heard a portent.

At about 4:30 a.m., Maureen Bunn awoke from a deep sleep to the sound of gunshots. They sounded like they were coming from the backyard of her housing complex, near Kingsborough.

""I thought, oh my god, I hope everybody's ok,"" she says, recalling the incident 27 years later.

Instinctively, she padded to her children's room, peering into the dark to check on them. Minutes after the bullets that killed Neischer tracked their fatal course through the soupy August air that night, Maureen noted with relief that her kids were safe.

John lay sound asleep in his bunk.

The trial

On August 17, Bunn was formally charged with robbery and murder. He was sent to the notorious Spofford Juvenile Detention Center in the Bronx, a vermin-infested concrete building that was shut down in 2011 after allegations of violence and abuse. There, he waited for 16 months.

Spofford was ""one of the most violent places I ever experienced,"" Bunn says. ""The staff members were very abusive. It was like gladiator school. You had to fight maybe three or four times a day.""

What's more, there was ""a target"" on his back because he had been charged with killing a corrections officer. The months rolled by as he waited for trial. His 15th birthday came and went. An increasingly depressed and scared Bunn didn't tell anyone about it.

A 2005 photo of the Bridges Juvenile Center, where John Bunn spent nearly a year and a half awaiting trial.

""Things like birthdays stopped existing to me,"" he says. ""Time stopped in there.""

Still, Bunn and his mother believed the trial would show he was not Neischer's killer. Among other factors, Crosson, the sole witness to the crime, had described the carjackers as being light-skinned men in their 20s's. John was darker skinned and a short, slight-framed teenager.

Bunn and Hargrave's trial took place in November of 1992, on Thanksgiving eve. Detective Scarcella had testified in pre-trial hearings, but on the day of the trial itself, just four people took the stand: the first police officer to arrive at the scene, the medical examiner, a 77th precinct detective, and Crosson, the sole primary witness who had picked both boys out of lineups.

The trial lasted just one day. Bunn and Hargrave were both found guilty.

""The truth didn't prevail, it didn't come out ... My side of the story never came out, either. I never got a chance to have a voice. I never got a chance to say anything,"" Bunn says.

Bunn was sentenced to 20 years to life, though it was later reduced to nine years to life after lawyers successfully argued that he had been illegally charged as an adult. Hargrave received a sentence of 30 years to life.

When, Maureen Bunn heard the word ""life"" she had to be rushed to the hospital.

""They said I had a mild heart attack. I couldn't breathe. I don't even remember when the ambulance came. I went into another world. It was just disbelief,"" she says.

Both Bunn and Hargrave filed appeals which were denied.

Imprisonment

After being found guilty. Bunn was immediately taken to a youth facility upstate. Maureen visited as much as she could, spending all her money on long bus rides upstate as the household bills and eviction notices stacked up.

But John was isolated physically -- and mentally. For a long time, he had hidden a secret. He had never learned to read or write.

""I was further away from my family. I wanted to communicate with my mother, because I felt like me and her didn't have the best relationship. And I was out there, and I just wanted to tell her how I felt, and that motivated me,"" he says.

Determined to be able to write letters to his mom, Bunn started with dictionaries and children's books, working with teachers on how to sound words out, letter by letter. It was humbling at first, but he learned fast. And as he got the hang of it, he says, ""it did something for my self-esteem, and my imagination.""

By the time he was 17 Bunn had his GED, and was reading anything he could get his hands on from the prison library. But turning 17 also marked a more sobering milestone: He would soon be eligible to be transferred to an adult facility.

Photos of John Bunn during his time in jail line the walls at the home of his mother, Maureen.

""I got my GED and I graduated to state prison,"" says Bunn, adding that he remembers the bus journey to the adult facility as ""one of the scariest feelings I ever experienced.""

""You hear all of the stories about how people get raped, and there's knives, and there's razors. But all along that bus ride, I went from being fearful and intimidated, to suddenly me becoming aggressive, because I felt like I had to be aggressive in order for them not to take advantage of me,"" he says.

Bunn noticed that, increasingly, he was finding his anger hard to control.

""I became institutionalized to the point where I start letting that experience make me angry. I started being bitter in there and started getting into violent situations.""

The Elmira Correctional Facility in Elmira, New York, where John did much of his reading.

Through it all, one thing kept him level-headed. To those in the prison, he may have been John Bunn, inmate number 7129748Q, Brooklyn boy, corrections officer killer. But, with a book in his hand, lying in his bunk on G block at Elmira Correctional Facility, an imposing Victorian building that sits high on a hill in upstate New York, Bunn felt free.

In the daytime, he began taking anger management classes, passing them with such flying colors that he became a qualified anger management counselor himself, running his own program for inmates.

At night, he would return to his cell where he would read slowly so he had ""something to look forward to,"" savoring each word amidst the familiar soundtrack of the prison at night -- the hum of 50 radios all softly playing different stations, the monologues of top-dog inmates holding court for 10 minutes at a time as others kept a respectful silence, and the ever-present clang of the gates that slammed and opened, slammed and opened, signaling the night and heralding the morning.

""I wrote my mother one day ... and I said, ""They can lock my body, but they can't trap my mind,"" Bunn says.

""The power of reading made me feel that way. I felt trapped without a voice for so long, but the power of reading could take my imagination, and take me to anywhere in this universe.""

In 2006, Bunn saved a prison counselor from being violently assaulted and raped by another inmate. His heroic actions were a factor in the parole board's decision to release him that year.

Bunn walked out of Elmira, wearing a shirt, shorts and a pair of Timberland boots bought for him by his family, and with his $40 of ""gate money,"" earned from his $7.50 a week prison salary, in his pocket.

""When I got in the lobby, my brother and cousin were there. Once I got to them I felt safe,"" he says. ""It was the first time I felt like I was safe again in 17 years.""

Exoneration

But out on parole, Bunn struggled. With his criminal record as a convicted murderer, he couldn't get a job. He was diagnosed with PTSD and was granted social security and disability.

Then, in 2008, after struggling with depression, he failed to report for a parole meeting and was sent back to jail. He returned to prison for another year and released in 2009.

""I wasn't able to adjust after being alone and gone for so long,"" he says.

Bunn's prison identification card.

But Bunn was about to get some long-awaited good news. In 2010, the Exoneration Initiative, a nonprofit organization that provides free legal assistance to the wrongfully convicted in New York, began looking into Bunn's and Hargrave's convictions (Hargrave had not been granted parole and remained behind bars).

And on top of that, many of Detective Sarcella's convictions from the 80's and 90's were beginning to crumble, one by one.

In April 2014 came a breakthrough. A new motion was filed by Rosean Hargrave's legal team to vacate the charges.

""The pattern and practice of Scarcella's conduct which manifest a disregard for rules, law and the truth undermines our judicial system and gives cause for a new review of the evidence,"" declared the judge in the case, Justice ShawnDya Simpson.

Judge Simpson overturned Rosean Hargrave's convictions and ordered a new trial. After 24 years in prison, Hargrave was released on bond, pending retrial.

A year later, after a similar motion was filed on John Bunn's behalf by the Exoneration Initiative, his own day in court came. In her ruling, Judge Simpson called the evidence used to convict Bunn ""paltry"" and slammed what she called Scarcella's ""disregard for rules, law and truth.""

In May of 2018, after 27 years of wrongful conviction, the District Attorney's office announced they would not retry Rosean Hargrave or John Bunn. They became the 12th and 13th men to be exonerated of convictions related to investigations by Detective Louis Scarcella.

After Judge Simpson announced he was a free man, Bunn addressed the courtroom.

""I am an innocent man, Your Honor, and I have always been an innocent man,"" he said, tears streaming down his face, as his mother, Maureen, audibly gulped back sobs.

John Bunn holds hands with Judge ShawnDya Simpson at the hearing where he was exonerated after 27 years.

To date, 70 of Detective Scarcella's cases from the 80's and 90's have been flagged for review. And at least 14 of Scarcella's homicide convictions have been overturned because of tainted evidence, misleading testimony or forced confessions, according to the Brooklyn District Attorney's office.

But it's unlikely that Scarcella will face any consequences. He has never been charged with a crime. According to the DA, prosecutors have not found any laws that can be prosecuted today. The statute of limitations has expired for any potential criminal offenses.

CNN's attempts to reach Detective Scarcella were not successful, but he told the Daily News in 2018 that he had done ""absolutely nothing wrong.""

Scarcella remains in New York City, living on Staten Island. He still collects a full NYPD pension.

A new chapter

There's a palpable sense of excitement in the classroom at Ember Charter School in Brooklyn, where 25 third-graders await that morning's class speaker. When John Bunn walks into the room, after a rousing chorus of ""GOOD MORNING JOHN BUNN,"" the class tumbles around him, lining up for hugs and high fives.

It's his second visit. He says the kids were so great the first time and had such smart questions that he had promised them he would come back. This time he's bearing presents -- tiny T-shirts in an array of colors, each with a logo that spells out the name of his new non-profit organization, ""A Voice 4 The Unheard.""

Bunn's project began as a book drive aimed at refurbishing the libraries at Rikers Island and providing under-resourced communities with educational literature. So far, he's donated over 20,000 books to help others affected by illiteracy and incarceration.

John Bunn leads a class at Ember Charter School in Brooklyn.

""Reading changed my life,"" Bunn says. ""I want to share that experience with other people.""

Along with starting a library on Rikers, he also works at the prison twice a week, running group sessions with 16- and 17-year-olds. He's also starting a book club for the teens and leading group discussions. More than anything, Bunn doesn't want the young boys he mentors to give up and become institutionalized.

""I explain to them, 'Anything is possible. Feel like you're too good to be in here!'"" he says.

Back at Ember Charter School, Bunn is leading a class discussion.

""Who here can tell me what peer pressure is?"" Bunn asks the class, as a staccato wave of small hands shoots into the air.

He guides the children through a question-and-answer session, then doles out a bunch of shirts in pink, yellow and black. The kids swarm Bunn when the session is over.

""Let's get a group hug, y'all,"" he says as the kids clamber on chairs to get closer to him. Bunn's eyes fill with tears.

""There's no greater feeling than me feeling like I'm existing for a purpose, and this is what gives my life purpose right now,"" he says.

Israeli scientists develop implanted organs that won’t be rejected,"Israeli scientists develop implanted organs that won’t be rejected - Breakthrough development uses a patient's own stomach cells, cutting the risk of an immune response to implanted organs.",1.0,"Israeli researchers report that they have invented the first fully personalized tissue implant, engineered from a patient’s own materials and cells. The new technology makes it possible to engineer any kind of tissue implant, for the spinal cord, to the heart, or brain, from one small fatty tissue biopsy.

“We were able to create a personalized hydrogel from the materials of the biopsy, to differentiate fatty tissue cells into different cell types and to engineer cardiac, spinal cord, cortical and other tissue implants to treat different diseases,” said lead researcher Prof. Tal Dvir of Tel Aviv University’s Center for Nanoscience and Nanotechnology and Sagol Center for Regenerative Biotechnology.

“Since both the cells and the material used derive from the patient, the implant does not provoke an immune response, ensuring proper regeneration of the defected organ,” Dvir explained.

The research was conducted by Dvir’s postdoctoral researcher, Reuven Edri, and doctoral students Nadav Noor and Idan Gal, in collaboration with Prof. Dan Peer and Prof. Irit Gat Viks of TAU’s Department of Cell Research and Immunology and Prof. Lior Heller of Assaf HaRofeh Medical Center in Israel. It was recently published in the journal Advanced Materials.

Avoiding anti-rejection drugs

Currently, in tissue engineering for regenerative medicine, cells are isolated from the patient and cultured in biomaterials to assemble into a functional tissue. These biomaterials can be synthetic or natural, derived from plants or animals.

After transplantation, they may induce an immune response that leads to rejection of the implanted tissue. Patients receiving engineered tissues or any other implants are treated with immuno-suppressors, which unfortunately can endanger the health of the patient.

The new method solves that problem.

“With our technology, we can engineer any tissue type, and after transplantation we can efficiently regenerate any diseased or injured organ — a heart after a heart attack, a brain after trauma or with Parkinson’s disease, a spinal cord after injury,” said Dvir.

“In addition, we can engineer adipogenic [fatty tissue] implants for reconstructive surgeries or cosmetics. These implants will not be rejected by the body.”

The researchers extracted a small biopsy of fatty tissue from patients, then separated its cellular and a-cellular materials. While the cells were reprogrammed to become induced pluripotent stem cells — able to make cells from all three basic body layers, so they can potentially produce any cell or tissue the body needs to repair itself — the extracellular material was processed to become a personalized hydrogel.

After combining the resulting stem cells and the hydrogel, the scientists successfully engineered the personalized tissue samples and tested the patients’ immune responses to them.

The researchers are currently engaged in regenerating an injured spinal cord and an infarcted heart with spinal-cord and cardiac implants. They have also begun to investigate the potential of human dopaminergic implants to treat Parkinson’s disease in animal models.

The researchers plan to regenerate other organs, including intestines and eyes, using the patients’ own materials and cells.

“We believe that the technology of engineering fully personalized tissue implants of any type will allow us to regenerate any organ with a minimal risk of immune response,” Dvir said.",https://www.israel21c.org/israeli-scientists-develop-implanted-organs-made-from-patients-own-cells/
"Utah Woman Donates Over 1,200 Handmade Toys to Migrant Children Separated From Parents","Utah Woman Donates Over 1,200 Handmade Toys to Migrant Children Separated From Parents",1.0,"When Sarah Parson’s friend told her about the children caught in the middle of the refugee crisis in Greece in 2015, she knew she had to do something to help.

""She had mentioned that the kids in the camps had no toys to play with, so they were playing with garbage and scorpions,"" said Parson, 42. “Just anything that they could find.”

With five kids of her own, she knew all too well how much toys meant to her children.

“They just love their stuffed animals,” she said. “They have so many of them. They carry them around everywhere.”

Parson said she had a sudden realization while watching her kids play with their toys that she could make handmade dolls and bears for children in need. Having previously made dolls for her girls, she knew she could make more.

From there, Dolls of Hope was born. Just two years later, she has sent more than 10,000 stuffed toys to children in 23 countries.

""There’s just something really special about making something for someone knowing it’s going to give them comfort,"" said Parson. ""And you put your heart into it and I really feel like the kids can feel that.""

In her most recent shipment, she sent more than 1,200 toys to migrant children separated from their families at the U.S.-Mexico border and placed in foster care.

The dolls were included in a bag full of gifts provided by Comfort Cases, with the goal of helping ease the transition for children entering foster care.

Parson lives with her children and husband in Cedar Hills, Utah, but she said the stories from the border hit close to home.

“I look at my own kids and I think, ‘How would my kids handle that if they were suddenly taken away from me?’” she said.

Parson hopes her dolls make the kids feel like kids again.

""My hope is we are giving a little piece of their childhood back,"" said Parson. ""That they can find comfort in that stuffed animal, or that doll. And that they can love that doll and hug that doll, even though they can’t hug their parents.""

Parson said she made the doll patterns simple so that anyone, even children, could get involved. Each and every doll is unique, “just like the kids who get them,” she said.

Parson thinks no problem is too big to run away from, and even the smallest efforts can lead to a big change.

“While it may seem overwhelming or we think the problem is too big, we could never solve the problem,” said Parson. “We can’t let that immobilize us to doing nothing because that doesn’t help. So we have to start where we are, doing what we can.”

Parson said she isn’t quitting anytime soon. “Too many children need us,” she said.

Wendall Gill's smiling face has greeted customers for decades at the Richmond Road McDonald's.

""Hi, How are you?"" he asked one customer Wednesday. It's a greeting he has said thousands of times at the restaurant.

Gill usually brings life to customers' faces, but two months ago, tragedy struck while at work when his wife Della decided to visit him for lunch. It would be their last meal together, as she went to the bathroom and never came out, dying of an aneurysm.

""When he walked up I could tell he was just destroyed, and he said ""I lost my wife,"" Todd Oldfield said.

""He had a lot of expenses that he was dealing with, especially being that he can't work full-time now because he's got his two sweet boys to take care of,"" Oldfield said, ""I wanted to pay off his van so he'd be able to drive his boys around.""

In 10 days the fundraiser collected $68,000. The money will go toward paying off Wendall's vehicles and other outstanding debt.

""I feel good, happy that people think that much of me to pay off my bills and stuff,"" Gill said.

Wendall put some of those donations to use Wednesday afternoon, as he made that final payment on his Jeep.

Canadian wins $1m Global Teacher Prize for work with Inuit students,"A Canadian who teaches at a school in a fly-in-only village in the Arctic won a $1m Global Teacher Prize at a ceremony in Dubai, praised for “changing the lives of her students and transforming her community”, she was among 10 finalists from 20,000 nominations and applications from 179 countries",1.0,"A Canadian who teaches at a school in a fly-in-only village in the Arctic has won a $1m (£800,000) Global Teacher Prize at a ceremony in Dubai.

Maggie MacDonnell, praised for “changing the lives of her students and transforming her community”, was among 10 finalists chosen from 20,000 nominations and applications from 179 countries.

She has taught for the past six years in the Inuit village of Salluit, Québec, in the Canadian Arctic, which has a high rate of suicide, according to her biography provided by the award organisers.

MacDonnell said she has witnessed over 10 suicides. “As a teacher, when I come to school the morning after there is an empty desk in that classroom. There is stillness and silence,” she said. “Thank you for bringing global attention to them,” she added.

MacDonnell has created a life-skills programme specifically for girls in a region where teenage pregnancies are common, alongside high levels of sexual abuse, according to her biography. Many teachers leave their posts midway through the academic year due to stress and the harsh conditions endured by the indigenous community.

The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, congratulated MacDonnell in a video message. “We are all proud of you,” he said.

MacDonnell, who has also been a temporary foster parent in the Inuit community, was handed the award at a ceremony on Sunday that opened with a performance by the Italian tenor Andrea Boccelli.

The Nobel-style award was set up three years ago by the Dubai-based Varkey Foundation. The prize is paid in instalments and requires the winner to remain a teacher for at least five years.

Last year a Palestinian teacher, Hanan al-Hroub, won the prestigious prize for her innovative approach of using play to counter violent behaviour among her students in the West Bank.",https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/mar/19/maggie-macdonnell-global-teacher-prize-canadian-inuit-school
Pearl Jam raises millions to help Seattle's homeless; local businesses join forces with iconic band,Pearl Jam raises millions to help Seattle’s homeless; local businesses join forces with iconic band,1.0,"



SEATTLE -- Thousands of people rushed Safeco Field on Wednesday to see Pearl Jam, with many of them camping out overnight to get the best view.



Others also waited as long as 3 hours to buy merchandise. The loyalty was in full display and now that loyalty could help make a dent in the region’s homeless crisis.



“They say something to you, you just follow suit,” fan David Morrison said.



Morrison traveled all the way from Australia to be a part of the two-day concert series called ""The Home Shows."" What he and others spent to be at the concert will help to fight our region`s homeless crisis.



“It’s awesome that they are doing that. Of course it’s cool,” fan Matt Ellis said.



The iconic members of Pearl Jam on their website say that the region's homeless population is the third largest in the country and it's not a number not to be proud of.



So now they are stepping in to help their hometown in a big way, giving some direction to a city struggling to put a dent in the crisis.



“People want to help but we often don't know what to do -- this is something that gives us traction,” Caffe Ladro owner Jack Kelly said.



Caffé Ladro is one of 140 businesses who are donating 10% or more from sales to the homeless problem.



Customers say it feels good to be a part of the solution.



“It becomes more deep-rooted when you're a parent, you want to know what the future is going to hold,” Krista Drumhiller said.



Drumhiller plans to spend her dollars at the businesses helping out.



That includes companies like Trophy Cupcakes, which has already sold hundreds of cupcakes decorated with Pearl Jam’s logo.



“Seven hundred so far, as of last night. We are hoping to do at least that many over the next couple of days,” Christina Logman said.



It’s a unified approach the city of Seattle doesn’t see every day.



“I think it's really unique, I don't think you see a lot of that, you see it somewhat on a small scale but this is on a massive scale,” one fan said.



Matt Hill took in the scene outside Safeco Field on Wednesday, selling the Real Change newspaper. He says he's moved by the community’s cooperation with Pearl Jam. Hill used to be homeless.



“I came to Seattle hoping to change that, and two years ago I was actually able to own my own place,” Hill said.



He says Pearl Jam's efforts will hopefully get more people into housing.



The Seattle Times reported that Pearl Jam has already raised more than $11 million as of Wednesday.



The second concert is set for Friday.



Pearl Jam is not only raising money but encouraging fans to volunteer their time. On their website they have listed organizations and events where fans can give their time, including an event on Thursday when there is a break between the two concerts.

"Davenport man beats COVID-19 after 99 days in hospital, family says","Davenport man beats COVID-19 after 99 days in hospital, family says",1.0,"DAVENPORT, Iowa (KWQC) - A Davenport man is on the road to recovery after spending roughly three months in the hospital due to COVID-19 and other complications. The family of 64-year-old Randy Burke said he spent 99 days at Genesis East Medical Clinic with 13 weeks of his stay being in the intensive care unit.

“Didn’t feel good. Didn’t notice a whole lot for a couple of days. Actually slept a lot,” said Kathy Burke, Randy’s wife.

The Davenport couple are high school sweethearts and have been together for 40 years. Kathy said he made her a promise.

“I said you told me you’d never leave me and I said I’m holding you to that. You better never leave,” she said.

Cough and fever came. Kathy said he started to feel okay and then things took a turn on July 2nd.

“He said I feel like I have knives poking in my head. So I said, okay, I’m done. I called 911, and they got here and his blood oxygen was down to 63, which normal is between, you know, 95 and 100,” she said.

When he went in, he was diagnosed with extensive bilateral pneumonia and COVID-19. During his stay, he was put on a ventilator and had a tracheotomy. Several weeks into his stay they also found out he had a rotten gallbladder and had to remove that as well.

For the first several weeks Kathy wasn’t able to see Randy. He tested negative for COVID-19 after roughly 6 weeks. Through it all, he beat the coronavirus and so much more. Kathy said at times the outlook was gloomy, with the ICU nurses unsure how he would be between their shifts.

“...some of them said they didn’t know when they left work on a certain day if they were going to see him when they got there the next morning,” she said,""...he was that ill.""

But Randy was a fighter and he had many people rooting for him. Family and friends used the hashtag #RallyforRandy on social media. He celebrated his 64th birthday the day before he was released, with the nurses surprising him with a decorated room.

“He was all surprised when we got back to the room. It was so [much] fun. They made things very joyous if you will. At a time where...well we didn’t know for sure. We didn’t know what the next day was going to bring,” she said.

The hospital staff sent him out with a celebratory parade leading out of the hospital doors. Cheers and chants filled the air. A moment of triumph for Randy and a new beginning.

“A couple of the nurses had told me that when they have people that have left the hospital, he’s been there probably one of the longest that they’ve had for this sort of deal, that they do do a parade through the hospital. So they did one through the floor that he was on and then I thought that was going to be it. Then we go down in the elevator and we’re walking out of the main part of the hospital and all those people were out there. I had no idea they’d be out there. That many of them. I mean like every department. I mean I was just...it was crazy. And then right by Randy, there were all the ICU nurses, and they had to all be there and his therapist and everything so it was incredible. It was incredible,” she said.

Kathy said the healthcare workers that helped Randy through this journey are all family now.

“They are the heroes. I don’t know what we would’ve done without them. They took care of him like he was their own. Like he, you know, he was their dad or their brother,” she said, “They really took such good care of him, and I can’t say enough about 'em,” she said.

Through it all, he beat the odds.

“Our general doctor said, you know, I honestly at one point Randy gave you 20% chance to make it,” she said, "" “to have him be at the stage he is now, although we thought 14 weeks was a long time and it is. There have been others that have been longer and you just have, stay with it and stay strong and keep pushing on, you know. Keep giving them...try to give them hope.”

Randy has a long road ahead of him as he starts rehabilitation.

“The nurses told me in the beginning, the kind of thing they go by is for every week in the ICU, it’s a month’s recovery. So when you look at it that way. He’s got at least a year [of] recovery. I’m sure some are sooner than others but that’s what they kind of go by.”

During Randy’s stay, Kathy said the support of their 3 daughters and a host of family and friends took care of her.

“They’ve been here for all of it. Family has been fabulous. Without them I don’t know what I do,” she said

Kathy said when he spoke to him Monday morning his voice was sounding stronger. More like himself. He started his rehabilitation process at Manor Care and will eventually go to Genesis West.

Kathy said they’re looking forward to eventually going to Florida to visit family and take a walk along the beach. Something they love to do.

Western Wisconsin woman removes tattoos forced on victims of violence for free,Abusers and human traffickers will often force victims to get tattoos as a way to exert control. A Wisconsin woman is giving survivors a fresh start by removing them for free.,1.0,"Onalaska (WQOW/WXOW) – A Wisconsin woman has found her life’s work in helping survivors of abuse erase scars that harbor painful memories.

For survivors of abuse, the emotional scars can last a lifetime. But for some, they’ve got physical scars in the form of tattoos, forced on them as a way to exert control. An Onalaska woman has found her purpose using high-tech machinery from her day job to help victims of violence, domestic abuse, and human trafficking get a fresh start.

Perfecting skin is all in a day’s work for Stephanie Andresen-Stephens. She owns Brilliant Body Works in Onalaska.

Now she can add tattoo removal to her resume. “When someone like myself chooses to go get a tattoo, we spend time and dedication going and designing it and telling our story… we’re doing it of our own free will.” Others are not. Human traffickers often tag their workers, gangs mark their members, and abusers can claim their victims, all through tattoos. “Often times people feel forced into it or it is very much forced upon them.”

That’s why she started Restorative Ink, a nonprofit removing the scars that harbor painful reminders of a previous life. She helped a woman named Tara erase the mark put on her body by an abusive ex-boyfriend.

Tara said it took about three hours to get the tattoo her boyfriend wanted on her. To take it off, it’ll be 6-12 sessions, and it feels like hot grease splattering all over the skin. But if you ask Tara, she’ll tell you the pain to remove the ink is nothing compared to what she endured at the hands of her abuser.

“The fear takes over you. You’re afraid to talk to people, to tell them what’s going on and you’re afraid you’re never going to get out of that situation,” said Tara.

Stephanie has found her calling erasing painful memories for people looking for a second chance. So far, she’s removed more than two dozen tattoos, and now people in prison are reaching out to her for help.

“One letter I got this gentleman is describing how he has three young children at home, and how he wants to be a better role model for them, and how his ex-gang symbols are going to keep him from getting a reputable job,” Stephanie said.

For Tara, the removal process has just begun, but already each painful stroke brings a glimmer of hope. “It will be amazing to not have that constant reminder of that time in my life where I went through some of the worst things I could possibly imagine.”

Tara said she has to thank Stephanie for her hard work to remove the painful reminder. Now she wants to begin the process of shifting her mindset from victim to survivor. “I’m so thankful to have the opportunity to be able to take my power back. He kind of took power away from me, in the time that we were together in the things that he did to me,” said Tara. “He broke me down… and Stephanie doing this for me is going to build me back up again.”

If you or someone you know is in need of tattoo removal from any of the scenarios above, you can contact Restorative Ink, operating out of Brilliant Bodywork in Onalaska.

Covid-19 victim who gave birth while on ventilator beats the virus,Covid-19 victim who gave birth while on ventilator beats the virus,1.0,"Megan Sites gave birth to her son, Jameson, while critically ill with coronavirus. (Picture: UC Health/Fox19)

A mother who gave birth while battling Covid-19 on a ventilator has beaten the virus.

Megan Sites, 27, underwent an emergency cesarean section to deliver her son at 29 weeks and six days this month as she battled the deadly virus on a ‘near-last resort’ ventilating machine that replaces the heart and lungs of a patient.

She was seven months pregnant with her second child when she took herself to Joint Township’s emergency department in Ohio on April 1 after she was having difficulty breathing and was unable to lie flat.

Testing uncovered that her lungs had been clotted with coronavirus and she was put on a ventilator while she was still awake. She said she could feel the tube scrape into her trachea as it was inserted. She was later sent to Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton. It is unclear how far along she was in her pregnancy when she tested positive for the virus.

Sites’s condition briefly improved, so the breathing machine was removed – but her condition then took a turn for the worse.

‘Within 24 hours, 48 hours, my condition completely worsened,’ she told the Columbus Dispatch.

Sorry, this video isn't available any more.

Sites said she was unable to see her husband Donny, her parents, in-laws, or friends because of hospital restrictions due to the outbreak.

‘I had a few breakdown moments. I told myself, “This is it, I’m not going to make it thorough,”‘ she said.

‘Everything in my body, it hurt to breathe, to move, to cough, to anything, it hurt.’

She asked hospital staff if she could go back on the ventilator, but this time she wanted to be sedated.

On April 8, doctors told Megan’s husband that the ventilator could help her get her pregnancy to 30 weeks. However, 20 minutes later he received a devastating call back from doctors that his wife’s lung had collapsed.

To save her, doctors said they had to deliver the baby the next day.

Sites had to undergo extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), which is a ‘near-last resort’ device that temporarily replaces the heart and lungs of patients, according to Dr Suzanne Bennett, a UC Health critical care anesthesiologist.

UC Health had reportedly never put a pregnant woman on an ECMO machine, but Sites was a good candidate.

Sites was then flown with the ECMO machine in a helicopter to Miami Valley Hospital where she underwent a cesarean section to deliver her son at 29 weeks and six days.

The baby was then taken to a neonatal intensive care unit. When she woke up she had no recollection of the delivery because of the sedation, she said.

‘I have a lot of hallucinations from that time…but the actual ECMO treatment, I don’t recall any of that,’ she said.

She now credits her medical team and the ECMO treatment for saving her life after she said her husband was told she had less than a 40% chance at survival.

‘It’s a miracle that I’m sitting here talking to you now,’ she said.

After ten days, Sites was finally able to see her baby, named Jameson, who is still in the NICU, although doctors said he is healthy with no signs of coronavirus.

He should be able to come home in four to five weeks.

‘There’s no words. There’s no way to show them the appreciation they deserve. It’s surreal,’ she said of her medical team.",https://metro.co.uk/2020/04/26/covid-19-victim-gave-birth-ventilator-beats-virus-12612573/
A Catfishing With a Happy Ending,A Catfishing With a Happy Ending: Emma was deceived by an older man on the internet—and then found love with the model whose photographs he had stolen,1.0,"It was April Fool’s Day, 2017, when Emma stood beneath the giant arrivals board at London’s Heathrow Airport, searching for Adem’s flight. When a lady beside her noticed her shaking hands, Emma explained that she was waiting for a man from the internet, whom she had never met. The woman froze. “You have to be very careful!” She warned, on the internet not everyone is who they say they are.

“Well actually, I know ...” Emma began, but the Turkish passengers were already flooding into the arrivals hall.

“Oh my God, it’s happening,” she thought.

When the crowd parted, she saw him walking toward her in a white T-shirt and a blue cardigan, the man in her photographs, come to life. Adem was taller than she expected, and when he recognized her, she felt breathless. As they hugged in the middle of the airport, Emma thought that he smelled “fantastique.”

In a quiet corner, Emma produced an egg-and-mayonnaise sandwich, which she had bought in case Adem was hungry. When he lifted it to his mouth, she noticed his hands were shaking too. “I was really nervous,” Adem said. They walked into the bitter cold air, and Emma summoned an Uber. It seemed to take forever. Adem was very quiet and there was a nervous energy between them. When he stepped off the curb to look for their car, Adem turned around and found Emma at eye level.

Inexplicably, she kissed him.

“Three minutes later I felt like I know her a long time,” Adem said. The spark was undeniable. She gave him a key to her apartment, and together they discovered the city like tourists, goofing around with a selfie stick. Later, when Adem opened his suitcase, Emma spotted the leather jacket from her favorite photograph, and felt starstruck. And Adem couldn’t believe his luck—his soul mate had appeared in his inbox as if by magic.

On April 23, 2017, their story became a tabloid sensation in England. “My catfish became cupid,” Emma told the Daily Mirror, “And now we’re living happily ever after.” Soon, other victims of Alan Stanley reached out to Emma. One woman from New York said she had been in a relationship with Ronnie for “years.” When the newspapers described Alan as a “love rat,” he endured summits about his behavior with his colleagues and employer, and an “awful” conversation with his daughter.

“These last few months have been beyond stressful,” he told me. “I don’t think I’ve slept properly for three or four months now.” Overwhelmed by shame, he moved to a faraway town. But even Alan felt relieved that the story ended in comedy, not a tragedy.

“I think it’s brilliant Emma and Adem have met,” he said. “It’s almost like fate.” Alan added that he no longer uses fake identities, and has since met someone special, he said, on Twitter: “A European lady, younger than me, younger than Emma.” There is someone out for there for everyone, he added. “I don’t consider myself to be particularly good-looking ... I’m not a David Beckham, or a Tom Cruise, or an Adem Guzel.”",https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/10/hook-line-and-sinker/542748/
German parliament votes to legalise same-sex marriage,German parliament votes to legalise same-sex marriage,1.0,"German MPs have voted in favour of legalising same-sex marriage, prompting joyous and unusual scenes in parliament as Green party politicians tossed glittered confetti across the chamber and gay couples sitting in the public gallery kissed and embraced.

The vote by 393 to 226, with four abstentions, followed 40 minutes of often heated and highly emotional debate, reflecting a wider, decades-long argument over marriage equality. The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, voted against the move, despite having paved the way for the law’s passage by inviting MPs to vote according to their conscience.



Merkel had appeared to shift her longstanding opposition to gay marriage on Monday, when she said that she considered “the values lived out in a same-sex partnership equal to those in a heterosexual marriage”. After dropping a red “no” card into the ballot box in the Bundestag, she explained: “For me, marriage as defined by law is marriage between a man and a woman.

“It was a long, intensive, and for many also emotional discussion, that goes for me personally too, and I’m hopeful not only that there will be respect for either side’s opinions, but that it will also bring about more peace and cohesion in society,” she said.

Since 2001, same-sex couples in Germany have been able to enter into civil unions, but not to marry. Under the new law, which is expected to take effect before the end of the year, married, same-sex couples will also be able to adopt children together.

The vote marked a stunning farewell victory for the Green politician Volker Beck, 56, a veteran gay rights campaigner who was ending a 23-year career as a lawmaker yesterday. “Today a bastion has fallen,” he told the German news agency DPA.

The Lesbian and Gay Association, which has pushed for the reform since 1990, greeted the outcome, declaring that “Germany has voted for love”. “This is a historic day!” it said in a statement. “Not only for lesbians and gays, but also for a more just and democratic society.”

It remains something of a mystery as to whether Merkel is a canny operator who had meant to trigger the vote all along, or whether she was, as much as anyone else in the Bundestag, taken by surprise that it had happened.

What is clear is that she will now be able to take credit for having triggered the vote, despite the fact she and her alliance have been opposing moves towards marriage equality for decades.

Merkel has also effectively taken the wind out of the sails of her junior coalition partners, the Social Democrats (SPD), who have treated gay marriage as a key campaigning issue in the runup to elections in September.

Some within the ranks of Merkel’s own Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party were furious about having been bulldozed into a vote at short notice, although she will feel that she can hold her head high with disaffected colleagues because of her no vote.

Merkel faced a barrage of criticism from within the chamber, with the sharpest rebuke coming from the SPD’s Johannes Kahrs, who accused her of having stood in the way of the law for years. “In all honesty, Frau Merkel, thanks for nothing,” he said.



The vote was set in motion during an audience with Merkel at Berlin’s Maxim Gorki theatre on Monday evening, hosted by the women’s magazine Brigitte. Merkel held court on the issue of marriage equality for eight minutes towards the end of the question-and-answer session, after Ulli Köppe, a journalist and events manager who was sitting in the audience, asked her: “When will I be able to call my boyfriend my husband?”

Merkel responded pensively, saying she had given the issue much thought and had come to the conclusion that a same-sex partnership could be considered “just as valuable” as a heterosexual one, but she believed that “for those who are religious”, the question was more complicated, and ultimately down to an individual’s conscience.

She went on to describe a “life-changing experience” she had had after meeting a lesbian couple in her home constituency on Germany’s Baltic coast. She told the pair that her personal “sticking point” over same-sex marriage was the issue of children’s welfare.

Gundula Zilm, who has been in a relationship for years with her partner, Christine, with whom she cares for five foster children, invited Merkel to visit her at home to see how well her children were doing. Merkel said the encounter had led to a change of heart because authorities clearly had confidence in the couple’s ability to care for the children.

“If the state deems a child to be better off in a same-sex partnership than living in a household with a man and woman where violence is the norm, then I must recognise this and take it into consideration when making a judgment,” she said to applause.

Her U-turn was seized on by the SPD as an opportunity to hold a snap vote on the issue ahead of the summer recess and before elections on 24 September. The move was greeted with disdain by many of the members of Merkel’s conservative alliance, who accused the SPD of forcing the issue on the Bundestag.

Köppe, 28, who put the question to Merkel, was in the Bundestag’s public gallery on Friday to await the outcome of the debate he had effectively sparked. He said: “My question was totally spontaneous and unplanned. Because no one else in the audience was asking a question, I just grabbed the microphone.”

He said he had expected the chancellor to give him a “wishy-washy answer – as she’s done previously”, but that her detailed answer had surprised him. “It just happened to be the right question at the right time,” he said.

He and his partner of 12 years would now consider getting married. “Just having a civil union as has been possible until now was simply not enough for my boyfriend and me.”

Zilm, who watched the Bundestag debate on television, said she was “deeply disappointed” that Merkel had voted no, but was celebrating the outcome nonetheless. “I was very sad that Merkel voted against,” Zilm said. “But when the kids come home from school, we’re going to take them for an ice-cream.” She and her partner, Christine, already in a civil union, are also planning to marry, and have said they will invite Merkel.

The law is expected to come into force before the end of the year after it has been approved by the upper house and signed into law by the president. Renate Künast of the Greens urged registry offices across the country to “stock up on staff” to cope with the flood of marriage applicants.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/30/germany-poised-legalise-same-sex-marriage-bill-law?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_reddit_is_fun

Paul Kernaleguen says regenerative agriculture has brought bees back to his farm.

“With the flowering species [of plants] we have now, you definitely see more,” he said.

He’s referring to the mixture of plants in his fields, near Birch Hills, Sask. Along with his partner, Erin Dancey, he now grows flowers like red clover, phacelia and sunflowers, along with barley, oats and peas they grow to feed their dairy cattle.

Dancey and Kernaleguen manage their fields with regenerative agriculture. They said the practice has brought greater profits, efficiency and a higher bee population.

Regenerative agriculture, says Cover Crops Canada spokesperson Kevin Elmy, is designed to replenish “the biology in our soils.”

“We’ve mined our soils and our soil is going in the wrong direction,” he said.

“We’ve lost about two-thirds of organic matter in our soils. It’s time to build it back.” Tweet This Click to share quote on Twitter: ""We've lost about two-thirds of organic matter in our soils. It's time to build it back.""

Elmy says the mixture of different crops, which bloom at different times and grow at different rates, replenishes the nutrients and bacteria necessary for the soil to be fertile. And he says that the flowers have encouraged the bees to repopulate.

Kernaleguen said there were lots of bees when he was growing up before they all but disappeared around 10 years ago.

“It’s encouraging,” he said. “It kind of lets you know [the bees are] happy with what you got and you’re helping out the ecosystem.

Kernaleguen didn’t switch to regenerative agriculture because he wanted more bees. He did it because, six years ago, he was worried about feeding his cattle.

“We were in some wet years, Kernaleguen said.

“What we were growing — barley and oats — kept drowning. [So we] got the idea to try something else.”

He attributes the better water management in the soil now to having more active root systems in the soil, and having cover crops — like alfalfa or clover — that are grown for the enrichment of the soil.

Some cover crops are grown all year.

Dancey, who moved to the farm three years ago, says that mixing the crops in the field has allowed them to harvest the mixed rations they need to feed their cattle. She estimates it now “takes probably a third of the time to get the feed in front of the cows.”

She says the new method has also made the farm more money.

“When you get higher quality feed to the animal then that obviously comes through in the milk side of it,” she said.

“We feel our cows are healthier [and that] they breed back better,” Kernaleguen said.

“They produce a lot more butterfat, butter protein and milk protein.”

He said that the cows now produce fewer litres of milk, but that the farm is making more money because Canadian dairy farms are paid for the kilograms of butterfat that they harvest.

He also said producing less milk has been better for the livestock.

“We don’t feel like we’re red-lining them like we used to. We used to push a lot more litres of milk per animal,” he said.

“The cows are stronger [and] healthier.”

The new farming system, and increased number of bees, has attracted the attention of General Mills, the maker of Cheerios and Lucky Charms.

“This is all-important to rebuild [the] soil health from areas where we source the ingredients,” said Jim Eckberg, a General Mills research agronomist. He said that GM is interested in the regenerative agriculture that Dancey, Kernaleguen and Elmy are using to improve the sustainability in their supply chain.

“Ultimately, to move into the 21st century, to be able to cope with the big challenges we have we need a healthier soil base,” he said, referring to soil depletion and sustainability.

“All of these practices can be implemented whether you’re in Texas or Saskatchewan.”

Saving The World One Banana Leaf At A Time,A supermarket in Thailand garnered attention from the netizens around the world for the implementation of its store policy which replaces plastic packaging in all of its produce with banana leaf wrappings.,1.0,"A supermarket in Thailand garnered attention from the netizens around the world for the implementation of its store policy which replaces plastic packaging in all of its produce with banana leaf wrappings.

A World Wrapped In Plastic

We have slowly become engrossed with the use of plastic packaging in almost everything that we buy. When we walk into a supermarket, the most common sight we see are products wrapped in plastic. Even fresh produce such as fruits and vegetables are now already sold inside this ubiquitous form of wrapping.

We might very well disregard this issue altogether. However, sooner than later, we might find ourselves living in an ocean full of plastics.

Sad to say, we don’t have to contemplate on how this could severely affect our environment. It’s already happening and unless you purposely shut yourself from hearing the latest news, we always often hear cases of marine life being threatened by the overflowing plastic waste in the sea.

Studies even show that in a matter of 30 years, more than 12 billion tonnes of plastic will completely cover the oceans and fill our landfills.

A Green Initiative

But apparently, all hope is not lost, as some of us still have the heart to change for the better.

The Rimping supermarket in Chiangmai, Thailand, for example, is strongly implementing a no-plastic-packaging policy in every fresh produce being sold. Instead, the store uses banana leaves.

The pictures posted on Facebook by a Chiang Mai-based real estate company, Perfect Homes, show Rimping’s banana leaf packaging in action.

The simple, yet highly relevant innovation is used to hold together bushels of spring onions, bunch of chillies and peppers, and clumps of leafy vegetables. With the help of what appears to be strings made from the hard and flexible part of banana trunk, everything is tied together neatly in place.

One can still notice the use of plastic in its labeling, however, the primary use of leaves significantly reduces the need to do it with plastic. As such, this store policy can be seen as a huge step for a greener, plastic-free earth.

A Sustainable Alternative

Interestingly, the use of banana leaves for packing and preserving food has been a tradition being practiced not only in most Asian nations, as it is also prevalent in Polynesian countries like in Guam or Hawaii. It is also being done in Mexico and Jamaica.

In Thailand, the Rimping supermarket in Chiangmai is considered as one of the first to employ the method on a large commercial scale.

While bananas can grow in most regions that have humid tropical climates, Asia is blessed with multiple varieties of this plant. Some types can survive with minimal care, while others have the characteristics to grow very rapidly, in just a matter of months.

In Thailand, for example, they have 30 different varieties of bananas. Even if the country decides to implement this innovation on a nation-wide scale, this resource is still believed to be sustainable and would be difficult to deplete.

Adapting In A Global Scale

We might wonder, can this method be applied globally? We can certainly hope so.

There could be problems with this approach especially in western countries where banana fruits have to be exported, let alone the leaves! These materials, despite its nature-friendly properties, aren’t as readily available as compared to here in Asia.

But then, Rimping supermarket’s initiative should serve as an inspiration for everyone around the world to get creative and come up with alternative ways to help save our environment.",https://www.breakingasia.com/news/saving-world-banana-leaf/
Vaccinations jump 500% in antivax hotspot amid measles outbreak,Vaccinations jump 500% in antivax hotspot amid measles outbreak,1.0,"Demand for measles vaccines leapt 500 percent last month in Clark County, Washington—a hotbed for anti-vaccine sentiment that has now become the epicenter of a ferocious measles outbreak.

As of February 6 , the county—which sits just north of the border from Portland, Oregon—has tallied 50 confirmed cases and 11 suspected cases of measles since January 1. The case count is rising swiftly, with figures more than doubling in just the last two weeks. On January 18, the county declared a public health emergency due to the outbreak.

Health officials have long feared an outbreak in the area, given the rampant skepticism of vaccines driven by misinformation and fear-mongering by anti-vaccine advocates. Only 76.5 percent of kindergarteners in Clark County had all the standard immunizations during the 2017-2018 school year. Overall, the county’s population is below the 92-percent to 94-percent range some experts consider necessary to curb the spread of disease.

But, that might be about to change. As the threat of measles has become all too real in Clark County, residents are lining up for vaccines, according to data first reported by Kaiser Health News. Orders of measles vaccines in the county reached 3,150 in January. That is nearly a 500-percent jump in orders from January last year, when the total was just 530. Statewide vaccine figures also reflect a boost. Orders for measles vaccine climbed 30 percent in Washington overall, from 12,140 doses in January last year to 15,780 doses in January of this year.

Though health officials are glad to see the surge in life-saving immunizations, the motivation is less encouraging. “I would rather it not take an outbreak for this to happen,” Alan Melnick, the Clark County health officer overseeing the response, told KHN.

Still, the response is unsurprising, according to Virginia Ramos, infection control nurse with Sea Mar Community Health Center, which runs six sites that offer vaccines in Clark County. “During an outbreak is when you see an influx of patients who would otherwise be vaccine-hesitant,” she said.

The Clark County health department has stressed the dangers of measles, which is an extremely contagious, air-borne viral disease. The health department notes on its website that:

The virus travels through the air and can stay up to two hours in the air of a room where a person with measles has been. If other people breathe the contaminated air or touch a contaminated surface, then touch their eyes, noses or mouths, they can become infected. Measles is so contagious that if one person has it, 90 percent of the people close to that person who are not immune will also become infected.

Measles usually starts with a high fever, cough, and runny nose, as well as red, watery eyes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It progresses to the telltale measles rash three to five days later, which breaks out all over the body and can be accompanied by fever spikes above 104 degrees Fahrenheit. Common complications include diarrhea and ear infections that can cause permanent hearing loss in children. Severe complications include pneumonia, which can be fatal, and encephalitis (swelling of the brain), which can lead to convulsions, hearing loss, and intellectual disabilities in children. Measles can also cause pregnant women to give birth prematurely or deliver a low-birth-weight baby.

The outbreak in Washington state is one of three ongoing in the US, with the other two in New York City and New York state. Cases have also been documented in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, New Jersey, Oregon, and Texas since the start of the year.",https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/02/vaccinations-jump-500-in-antivax-hotspot-amid-measles-outbreak/
Texas medical student survives 6 brain surgeries while studying to be doctor at hospital treating her,Texas medical student survives 6 brain surgeries while studying to be doctor at hospital treating her,1.0,"Claudia Martinez, 28, is a walking miracle. She's also a fourth-year medical student at the same hospital that has treated her throughout six brain surgeries.

The Brawley, Calif., native who was raised in Houston, Texas wanted to be a doctor since she was a little girl but she never could have imagined the journey it would take her on, which she now describes as ""a blessing in disguise.""

TEXAS WOMAN TAKEN OFF LIFE SUPPORT AGAINST FAMILY'S WISHES – THEN A PRO-LIFE GROUP STEPPED IN

Martinez received a devastating diagnosis as an undergraduate student at the University of Houston. Plagued by headaches and blackouts, Martinez was told her debilitating condition was called Chiari Malformation, which involves brain tissue extending into the spinal cord. It could cause paralysis.

But despite the diagnosis, surgeries, and going in and out of hospitals, Martinez graduated with a 4.0 and got accepted into her dream medical school, the University of Texas at Houston, where she was being treated.

""My journey has been long and at times has felt impossible, but what keeps me going is my future patients,"" Martinez told Fox News. ""I've learned we don't necessarily need a cure. We need inclusion, we need patience, we need accessibility, and we need individuals who are willing to work with us to give us the reasonable accommodations that, by law, we are entitled to.""

Martinez suffered a seizure during her first year of medical school and had to undergo experimental surgery. During her third year, she suffered a stroke that left her unable to function from the neck down. She was transferred to TIRR Memorial Hermann Hospital for intense neuro-rehabilitation where she learned to walk, feed, dress, and bathe once again.

""Yes, I'm here to advocate for myself, but more importantly for those who do not yet have a voice, for those coming after me, and for my future patients,"" she added. ""If I can set a trail to guide others so they don't have to suffer as much as I have, then it will all be worth it.""

Martinez has shared her journey on Instagram, inspiring others through her honesty and fight.

CONNECTING THROUGH FAITH WITH A MISSION TO HEAL COUNTRY’S RACIAL DIVIDE

""I thank God every day for what I’ve gone through, [because] it is how I’ve found my calling,"" Martinez wrote on her Instagram. ""I’ve officially decided to pursue a residency in PM&R (Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation).""

She added: ""I want to be on the side of medicine that most people don’t see. I want to work with a population of individuals whose worth and potential is often overlooked and be their advocate. I want to help them see that even though it may be a little different, life can be beautiful again.""

But Martinez doesn't use med school or being a patient as an excuse.

She also mentors college students, especially underrepresented minorities who are interested in pursuing medicine, through programs like Aspirations in Medical Professions, SMDEP Mentorship Program, Pre-Jamp symposium, and on her own.

Satellite Shows High Productivity from U.S. Corn Belt,NASA Satellite Shows Corn Belt Produces 40% More Oxygen Than Amazon Rainforest,1.0,"[image-51]Data from satellite sensors show that during the Northern Hemisphere's growing season, the Midwest region of the United States boasts more photosynthetic activity than any other spot on Earth, according to NASA and university scientists.

Healthy plants convert light to energy via photosynthesis, but chlorophyll also emits a fraction of absorbed light as fluorescent glow that is invisible to the naked eye. The magnitude of the glow is an excellent indicator of the amount of photosynthesis, or gross productivity, of plants in a given region.

Research in 2013 led by Joanna Joiner, of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., demonstrated that fluorescence from plants could be teased out of data from existing satellites, which were designed and built for other purposes. The new research led by Luis Guanter of the Freie Universität Berlin, used the data for the first time to estimate photosynthesis from agriculture. Results were published March 25 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

According to co-author Christian Frankenberg of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., ""The paper shows that fluorescence is a much better proxy for agricultural productivity than anything we've had before. This can go a long way regarding monitoring – and maybe even predicting – regional crop yields.""

[image-36]Guanter, Joiner and Frankenberg launched their collaboration at a 2012 workshop, hosted by the Keck Institute for Space Studies at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, to explore measurements of photosynthesis from space. The team noticed that on an annual basis, the tropics are the most productive. But during the Northern Hemisphere's growing season, the U.S. Corn Belt ""really stands out,"" Frankenberg said. ""Areas all over the world are not as productive as this area.""

The researchers set out to describe the phenomenon observed by carefully interpreting the data from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment 2 (GOME-2) on Metop-A, a European meteorological satellite. Data showed that fluorescence from the Corn Belt, which extends from Ohio to Nebraska and Kansas, peaks in July at levels 40 percent greater than those observed in the Amazon.

Comparison with ground-based measurements from carbon flux towers and yield statistics confirmed the results.

The match between ground-based measurements and satellite measurements was a ""pleasant surprise,"" said Joiner, a co-author on the paper. Ground-based measurements have a resolution of about 0.4 square miles (1 square kilometer), while the satellite measurements currently have a resolution of more than 1,158 square miles (3,000 square kilometers). The study confirms that even with coarse resolution, the satellite method could estimate the photosynthetic activity occurring inside plants at the molecular level for areas with relatively homogenous vegetation like the Corn Belt.

[image-80]Challenges remain in estimating the productivity of fragmented agricultural areas, not properly sampled by current space-borne instruments. That's where missions with better resolution could help, such as NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 – a mission planned for launch in July 2014 that will also measure solar-induced fluorescence.

The research could also help scientists improve the computer models that simulate Earth's carbon cycle, as Guanter found a strong underestimation of crop photosynthesis in models. The analysis revealed that carbon cycle models – which scientists use to understand how carbon cycles through the ocean, land and atmosphere over time – underestimate the productivity of the Corn Belt by 40 to 60 percent.

Unlike most vegetation, food crops are managed to maximize productivity. They usually have access to abundant nutrients and are irrigated. The Corn Belt, for example, receives water from the Mississippi River. Accounting for irrigation is currently a challenge for models, which is one reason why they underestimate agricultural productivity.

""If we don't take into account irrigation and other human influences in the agricultural areas, we're not going to correctly estimate the amount of carbon taken up by vegetation, particularly corn,"" Joiner said. ""Corn plants are very productive in terms of assimilating carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This needs to be accounted for going forward in trying to predict how much of the atmospheric carbon dioxide will be taken up by crops in a changing climate.""

According to Frankenberg, the remote sensing-based techniques now available could be a powerful monitoring tool for food security, especially data from OCO-2 and in combination with data from other upcoming satellites, such as NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive, scheduled for launch later this year.

NASA monitors Earth's vital signs from land, air and space with a fleet of satellites and ambitious airborne and ground-based observation campaigns. NASA develops new ways to observe and study Earth's interconnected natural systems with long-term data records and computer analysis tools to better see how our planet is changing. The agency shares this unique knowledge with the global community and works with institutions in the United States and around the world that contribute to understanding and protecting our home planet.",https://www.nasa.gov/press/goddard/2014/march/satellite-shows-high-productivity-from-us-corn-belt/
Canada Just Ruled to Uphold Net Neutrality,Canada just ruled to Uphold Net Neutrality,1.0,"On Thursday afternoon, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), the country's federal telecom regulator, dropped a bombshell ruling on the status of net neutrality—the principle that all web services should be treated equally by providers. And, blessedly, it's good news.

The CRTC ruled that ""[internet] service providers should treat data traffic equally to foster consumer choice, innovation and the free exchange of ideas,"" a CRTC news release states. What this means is that service providers won't be able to privilege certain services over others—say, YouTube or Apple Music—by letting you use them without dinging your data plan. This is a practice generally known as ""zero-rating"" or differential pricing.

Differential pricing contradicts the principle of net neutrality because it allows service providers to leverage their privileged position to decide which services are most attractive to their customers, effectively discriminating against others.

The CRTC's decision is welcome news as its sister organization in the US, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), is right now starting to roll back some of its previous commitments to net neutrality.

The CRTC ruling originated from complaints against Quebec-based provider Videotron's unlimited music streaming service, which launched in 2015. The service allowed subscribers to stream music from third-party apps without it counting against their data plans.

Those complaints sparked a series of hearings on the practice of differential pricing. At the time of the hearings in the fall of last year, two of Canada's ""big three"" telecom providers came out in support of differential pricing—Telus and Bell—while Rogers was the sole dissenting voice among the trio.

The CRTC also ruled on the Videotron case today, and in line with its decision on net neutrality and its new framework for evaluating differential pricing schemes—also published on Thursday—it ordered Videotron to come into compliance with the law, which is a nice way of saying it should stop offering its unlimited music service as it stands. The company has yet to release a public statement responding to the order.

A support group in your phone. Healing for mental illness comes one text at a time.,"Man who struggled w/mental illness starts service to send nice texts to people with stress, anxiety, and negative thoughts",1.0,"Johnny Crowder used to have a negative outlook on the world.

He grew up in what he described as an abusive household. He was diagnosed with a slew of mental illnesses during his formative years, from bipolar disorder to obsessive compulsive disorder. It was easy for him to feel down about himself.

""I realized how I was thinking was contributing to my struggles,"" said Crowder, a 26-year-old Tampa native. ""But I couldn't climb out of it.""

So he started filling sticky notes with positive, affirmative messages, and leaving them around his house. On one note, he remembers penciling, ""You deserve to spend time with people who care about you.""

It made a difference. For just a few seconds a day, he'd feel better. But eventually the notes became commonplace, and their effect seemed to wear off.

So he decided to try it another way. This time, by sending uplifting text messages to his friends to see how they reacted.

""The first text, I sent to about 32 friends in my contacts, with the same message. Nearly everyone responded,"" he said. ""They interpreted it differently based on their own lives, but I was surprised to see so many of them replied with 'How did you know?' Like I knew they were going through something.""

That's how Crowder founded Cope Notes.

It's a text messaging service aimed at those going through a difficult time. Every day, a Cope Notes user will get a random message, usually something uplifting, but it could also be advice about an exercise to try or tips to boost positivity. Users are encouraged to text back, and to use the thread as their own ""digital journal,"" Crowder said.

""People would rather text their friends than talk to them about something difficult,"" he said. ""We wanted to create something that was optionally interactive. Some of the texts are prompts, and while it's not necessarily a two-way conversation, we want the platform to foster independence. The goal is not to be something people rely on forever.""

RELATED: When suicide threats come calling: 'I try to make a connection.'

Crowder's timing, it seems, is important. Depression diagnosis rates rose 33 percent from 2013 to 2016, according to the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association's Health of America Report. Children and millennials seem to be the most at risk, with diagnosis rates spiking by 63 percent and 47 percent, respectively, over the same period.

Women, too, seem to suffer from depression more often, with diagnosis rates that are double those of men, according to the Blue Cross report.

What's more, the report said, people with depression are nearly 30 percent less healthy on average than those without it, and 85 percent also suffer from other chronic health conditions.

Cope Notes launched quietly nearly a year ago from Crowder's South Tampa home, and now has about 1,000 users. Crowder said they range in age from 14 to 40. He's the one writing the messages that are delivered each day, but they are reviewed by a panel of mental health counselors and professors, public relations professionals and privacy compliance officials.

The service costs $9.99 a month, or $8.99 a month for an annual subscription. There's also an option of a one-week free trial.

A recent example of a Cope Notes message: ""When you hold the door open for someone, and they step on your foot, you should still be proud. Their bad decision doesn't invalidate your good one.""

Another one said, ""The entire world was changed by people just like you. Normal folks who didn't think they were just about to change the world. Don't underestimate yourself.""

And this: ""Coloring for 15 minutes can help clear your mind and soothe anxiety. It may sound childish, but how do you think adult coloring books became best sellers?""

Cope Notes is not meant to replace therapy or clinical treatment, but it can supplement it, said Kristin Kosyluk, an assistant professor in the Department of Mental Health Law & Policy at the University of South Florida. She said Crowder and his text messaging platform are also good examples of where mental health care is headed.

""We're moving toward a recovery model and away from a medical model,"" Kosyluk said. ""It gives someone like Johnny, who has been through the system and has personal experience, the authority and credibility to provide support to others.""

Kosyluk cited the ""Alcoholics Anonymous"" community — where people who have suffered from the same afflictions, comfort and support one another — as a good example of a recovery model.

""Cope Notes has that piece to it because Johnny is open about his experiences,"" she said. ""A lot of times, people are seeking help in a clinical setting and not finding support in their own communities. A simple text message that somebody receives, that's an intervention being delivered in the moment.""

Kosyluk is working with Crowder to potentially collect research data from Cope Note users in the future.

ALSO READ: Pediatricians are the new allies in the battle against teen depression. They can spot it early.

Before becoming a mental health activist in 2011, speaking about his survival story to community groups and schools, Crowder tried just about anything that would help as he struggled with depression.

""I tried meditation apps, the Tony Robbins 'walk on coals' type self-help people. You name it, I was hungry for anything that would help me cope with what was happening to me.""

But what bothered him most about the programs he tried were the promises of an overnight cure.

""It takes a long time to feel better. There's no flip of a switch in your brain that makes everything normal,"" he said. ""It takes a lot of tiny steps and nudges in the right direction over time to heal and come up with healthy coping practices.""

Jimmy Carter back to building homes in Canada after after being treated for dehydration,Jimmy Carter back to building homes in Canada after after being treated for dehydration,1.0,"Jimmy Carter was back at a Habitat for Humanity worksite Friday, a day after the former president was hospitalized for dehydration while working with the organization to build homes for needy families in Canada.

A smiling Carter showed up in blue jeans and a work shirt to the site in the St. James neighborhood of Winnipeg, where hundreds of Habitat for Humanity volunteers joined him and his wife, Rosalynn, to build 25 homes.

Carter, 92, was discharged earlier in the morning from St. Boniface General Hospital, where he was treated “as a precaution” for dehydration, Carter spokeswoman Deanna Congileo said. He then attended a prayer service at the work site.

“He and Mrs. Carter extend their appreciation for the many well-wishes he received worldwide,” Congileo said in a statement.

Habitat for Humanity, which has had a long association with the Carters, is constructing 150 homes this year for people in need in Canada to celebrate the country’s 150th anniversary.

The Carters were in Edmonton, where Habitat for Humanity is building 75 homes, from Monday to Wednesday before coming to Winnipeg.

The former president had been working for about 90 minutes Thursday morning when he went to sit in a chair, the Winnipeg Free Press reported. He appeared to wobble, so Secret Service agents led him to his motorcade. He was treated by paramedics who took him away in an ambulance, without using lights or siren, the newspaper said.

This week’s project building houses in several Canadian communities is the 34th time the Carters have pitched in on Habitat for Humanity projects, lending a hand and their name to promote the work.

Carter was diagnosed with melanoma that spread to his brain in 2015, but announced in March of the following year that he no longer needed treatment. Carter continued to volunteer for Habitat for Humanitywhile being treated for cancer, working alongside volunteers at a home in Memphis, Tenn., in November 2015.

We Have to Save the Planet. So I’m Donating $1 Billion. - The New York Times,We Have to Save the Planet. So I’m Donating $1 Billion.,1.0,"But some scientists, including the Harvard biologist Edward O. Wilson, have concluded that at least half the planet needs to be protected to save a large majority of plant and wildlife species from extinction. Indeed, the food, clean water and air we need to survive and prosper depends on our ability to protect the planet’s biological diversity. In other words, we have to protect half to save the whole.

Every one of us — citizens, philanthropists, business and government leaders — should be troubled by the enormous gap between how little of our natural world is currently protected and how much should be protected. It is a gap that we must urgently narrow, before our human footprint consumes the earth’s remaining wild places.

For my part, I have decided to donate $1 billion over the next decade to help accelerate land and ocean conservation efforts around the world, with the goal of protecting 30 percent of the planet’s surface by 2030. This money will support locally led conservation efforts around the world, push for increased global targets for land and ocean protection, seek to raise public awareness about the importance of this effort, and fund scientific studies to identify the best strategies to reach our target.

I believe this ambitious goal is achievable because I’ve seen what can be accomplished.

Indigenous peoples, local leaders and conservation groups around the world are already busy setting aside protected areas that reflect the conservation, economic and cultural values of nearby communities. Financial support from philanthropists and governments is critical to helping these leaders conserve places like the coral reefs of the Caribbean, the glaciers of Argentina and what is known as the “place of many elephants” in Zimbabwe.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/31/opinion/earth-biodiversity-conservation-billion-dollars.html?action=click&module=Opinion&pgtype=Homepage

“This man is a whole (expletive) legend in these streets,” Minaj said on-air during her NSFW Queen Radio show on Beats 1. “That man is now getting so many opportunities, I personally want to donate ... $25,000.”

Owens, who played Sondra Huxtable’s husband, Elvin, on ""Cosby"" in the '80s and '90s, worked at Trader Joe's for 15 months in between acting gigs to make ends meet.

“I’d been teaching, acting, directing for 30-plus years, but it got to a point where it just didn’t add up enough and you gotta do what you got to do,"" he told Robin Roberts on ""Good Morning America,"" adding the job offered ""flexibility"" so he could ""try to stay in the business.""

Several media outlets reported on Owens' day job, in what many including the actor himself deemed as an attempt to job-shame him. The disappointment didn't last long, however, because the unwanted limelight proved fruitful.

Since the viral photo, and the subsequent backlash, Owens landed roles on Tyler Perry's ""The Haves and the Have Nots,"" ""NCIS: New Orleans"" and Hilary Swank's upcoming thriller ""Fatale."" The donation from Minaj was the cherry on top, which Owens ultimately decided to donate to a charity close to his heart.

""Thank you to Geoffrey Owens for paying forward his gift from Nicki Minaj & making a very generous donation of $25,000 to our work,"" tweeted the Actor's Fund, an organization that provides financial support and a ""safety net"" for entertainers over the course of their lives.

Minaj approved of the move.

Pupils suffering from anxiety and depression to receive counselling in schools,Children suffering from anxiety and depression will be offered counselling at school under government plans to tackle a widely reported crisis in young people’s mental health...attempt to stop any psychological difficulties deepening into lifelong issues.,1.0,"Children suffering from anxiety and depression will be offered counselling at school under government plans to tackle a widely reported crisis in young people’s mental health. Pupils in England will be able to attend sessions with therapists at school or college in an attempt to stop any psychological difficulties deepening into lifelong issues.

Every school will also be required to appoint a teacher to co-ordinate improved support for the fast-growing number of children who are struggling mentally, many self-harming as a result of bullying, exam stress, dissatisfaction with their body shape, troubles at home and other factors.

The plans are included in a government green paper to be launched on Sunday by health secretary Jeremy Hunt and education secretary Justine Greening.

A new guaranteed maximum four-week waiting time for children with more complex problems to access NHS child and adolescent mental health services (Camhs) will be phased in. That is a response to concerns that many vulnerable under-18s, including some who may be suicidal, are being forced to wait for care or even denied help because Camhs care is overloaded.

“Around half of all mental illness starts before the age of 14 so it is vital that children get support as soon as they need it – in the classroom. If we catch mental illness early we can treat it and stop it turning into something more serious,” said Hunt.

Sarah Brennan, chief executive of the charity YoungMinds, welcomed the plans. “We are facing a crisis in our classrooms and far too many children are not getting the support they need. Too often we hear from young people who have started to self-harm, become suicidal or dropped out of school while waiting for the right help,” she said.

The improvements will begin in 2019 and be backed by what the government says is £300m of new funding over several years, which is on top of the £1.35bn the coalition government allocated to children’s mental health up to 2020.

The National Association of Head Teachers, which represents most primary school heads, welcomed the four-week Camhs waiting time as an “extremely important step forward”. Under-18s are currently enduring waits of as long as 18 months, the NHS regulator said recently.

Around £215m of the £300m will fund the creation of mental health support teams in schools. Ministers intend that several thousand new “children and young people’s wellness practitioners”, therapists providing mainly cognitive behaviour therapy, will undertake most of the work with pupils, but with school nurses and educational psychologists also involved. Ministers hope that this increase in early intervention will reduce the number of children who go on to struggle mentally as adults.

However, the initiatives will initially be piloted to assess their effectiveness, so the new forms of support envisaged will not be available across England until an unspecified time in the 2020s. The government’s ambition is only that they have been put in place in a fifth of the country by 2022-23.

Dr Bernadka Dubicka, a children’s psychiatrist who chairs the Royal College of Psychiatrists’ child and adolescent faculty, said she was frustrated that more help would not be put in place sooner. While welcoming the four-week treatment pledge, she also queried where the extra mental health professionals would come from to provide speedier Camhs care. Official figures show that the number of specialist children’s psychiatrists working in the NHS in England has fallen since 2013.

Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston, chair of the health select committee, welcomed the announcement but said she was keen to see more details. “We need to have a much greater focus on early intervention and prevention. Any money going into that is a good thing,” she said.

She welcomed better coordination between schools and the NHS, but said that some schools were already working well with the health service and others should learn the lessons from those places. “It’s often down to resourcing,” she said. “Most young people prefer to have these services delivered in a setting of school because it’s much easier to access. Children don’t necessarily want to feel stigmatised by a referral to psychiatric services.”

Catherine Roche, chief executive of the national children’s mental health charity Place2Be, said: “We welcome the commitment demonstrated by the green paper, and are heartened to see recognition of how vital it is to provide mental health support in schools. We believe that a ‘whole school approach’ to mental health is essential to build a culture of openness and understanding, with appropriately qualified mental health professionals available when needed.”

Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb, the coalition’s mental health minister, said: “We published the Future in Mind report in March 2015. It was a blueprint for modernising children and young people’s mental health services. They have failed to drive the implementation of that blueprint. Why should we have any expectation that this will be any different? They should have just implemented it. At its heart it was all about linking schools much more closely with mental health services. Two years on, deja vu.”

Barbara Keeley, Labour’s shadow cabinet minister for mental health, said that the plans left “many unanswered questions”, including over funding and whether every school would be able to help every pupil who needed it. “The Tories’ record on children and young people’s mental health has been shocking, with a postcode lottery of provision across child and adolescent mental health services and many long waits for treatment,” she said.",https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/03/children-with-mental-health-issues-to-get-more-help-but-not-until-the-2020s
An adopted 14-year-old girl is helping senior dogs find a forever home just like she did,An adopted 14-year-old girl is helping senior dogs find a forever home just like she did,1.0,"(CNN) A 14-year-old girl has raised $14,000 for senior dogs who have been left behind with the goal of helping them find a forever home like she did when she was adopted.

Meena Kumar at nine months old was found abandoned in a basket on a college campus in Pune, India. After spending a year in an orphanage, she was adopted by a couple in Mumbai and brought to San Jose, California.

In Mumbai, Meena would watch over a litter of puppies at her home. When she came to the United States, almost every weekend included a trip to the Humane Society or to Muttville Senior Dog Rescue

Muttville is a cage-free dog rescue that gives senior dogs a ""second chance at life,"" according to their website. The organization was founded by 2016 CNN Hero Sherri Franklin and rescues about 1,000 dogs per year and runs mostly with the help of volunteers.

Meena first heard of the rescue from a neighbor whose dog had been adopted from Muttville. The neighbor shared stories of how senior dogs are often left behind in shelters. With tender love and care, those dogs can make great companions.

""More people should adopt senior dogs,"" says Meena. ""They give you the same unconditional love as any other dog.""

Meena understood what it felt like to be left behind, and wanted to help the senior dogs find the loving homes they deserve, just like she did. The problem was, Meena had to be 17-years-old to volunteer at Muttville, and she was only 12.

She wanted to find a way to support Muttville and came up with an idea. She advertised on Nextdoor offering pet sitting and Pet Fairy Services was born.

Meena began pet sitting in her own home for her neighbors and school friends with the goal of supporting Muttville. ""You are never too young to start a business,"" says Meena.

Meena Kumar hopes more people will adopt older mutts during the pandemic.

With rates of $35 per day and several years of hard work, Meena has managed to raise $7,000 for Muttville. That number doubled to $14,000, thanks to a matching donation program with Intel , where her father works. The Intel Volunteer Matching Grant Program encourages employees to donate time, money or labor to nonprofits that give back to their communities, according to Intel's website.

Meena plans to continue working with Muttville and hopes that more people will adopt older mutts from shelters during this pandemic

""We need their love more than ever,"" she says.",https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/02/us/teen-senior-dogs-adoption-trnd/index.html
17-year-old discovers planet 6.9 times larger than Earth on third day of internship with NASA,17-year-old discovers planet 6.9 times larger than Earth on third day of internship with NASA,1.0,"During his junior year at Scarsdale High School in New York, Wolf Cukier landed a two-month internship with NASA. So during the summer of 2019, he traveled down to NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.

His first assignment was to examine variations in star brightness captured by NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, known as TESS, as a part of the Planet Hunters TESS citizen science project. (The citizen science project allows people who don't work for NASA to help with finding new planets.)

Just three days into his internship, Cukier discovered a new planet.

NASA announced the news on their website this week, after confirming the teenager's work, submitting a paper that Cukier co-authored for scientific review and announcing the discovery of the planet, now named ""TOI 1338 b,"" at the 235th American Astronomical Society meeting.

""I was looking through the data for everything the volunteers had flagged as an eclipsing binary, a system where two stars circle around each other, and from our view eclipse each other every orbit,"" 17-year-old Cukier tells NASA. ""About three days into my internship, I saw a signal from a system called TOI 1338. At first I thought it was a stellar eclipse, but the timing was wrong. It turned out to be a planet.""

""I noticed a dip, or a transit, from the TOI 1338 system, and that was the first signal of a planet,"" Cukier explains to NBC 4 New York. ""I first saw the initial dip and thought, 'Oh that looked cool,' but then when I looked at the full data from the telescope at that star, I, and my mentor also noticed, three different dips in the system.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/10/17-year-old-discovers-planet-on-third-day-of-internship-with-nasa.html
Lawyer fighting palm oil among 6 to win environmental prize,Lawyer fighting palm oil among 6 to win environmental prize,1.0,"BOSTON (AP) — When Alfred Brownell arrived in a remote Liberian village, the surrounding tropical rainforest had been leveled by bulldozers. Burial grounds were uprooted, religious shrines were desecrated and a stream people depended upon for water was polluted.

Brownell, an environmental lawyer and activist, blamed the devastation on the palm oil company Golden Veroleum Liberia. The company had been given a green light in 2010 by the government to expand in the country and was poised to turn more than 800 square miles (2,000 square kilometers) of lush forest into palm oil plantations.

Brownell on Monday was awarded the Goldman Environmental Prize for exposing alleged abuse by the company and helping to prevent it from converting about 20 square miles (about 50 square kilometers) of forest that is home to elephants, pygmy hippopotamuses and chimpanzees.

He said he was forced to flee the country in 2016 after the government threatened to arrest him for his activism.

""It was total annihilation,"" said Brownell, now a visiting scholar at Northeastern University's School of Law in Boston.

""It was just not that they were destroying the forest, destroying habitat for species and everything,"" he said. ""They had also a system where they were working with the local government officials who were threatening, harassing and intimidating the communities.""

A spokesman for the company, Randall Kaybee, acknowledged in a statement that ""there have been lapses in following its own operating procedures, resulting in grievances among some communities and in the inadvertent clearance of some high carbon stock forest areas."" He said measures have been put in place to address these problems.

Gregory Coleman, who now heads Bureau of Concessions under Liberia's current government, said authorities are working to avoid past problems like those that arose with Golden Veroleum.

""A green Liberia is the ultimate goal of this government and we have agreed to halt all expansions until we can line up all the requirements in accordance to international best practices,"" he added.

Story continues

For his work saving forest lands, Brownell won the Goldman prize along with five others for grassroots environmental activism. The prize was created in 1989 by the late San Francisco philanthropists Richard and Rhoda Goldman. Winners are selected from nominations made by environmental organizations and others. The prize carries a $200,000 award.

The other winners are:

— Linda Garcia of Vancouver, Washington, who rallied local communities to successfully prevent the construction of North America's largest oil terminal.

— Ana Colovic Lesoska of North Macedonia, whose seven-year campaign helped stop hydroelectric projects from being built in the country's largest national park and home to the endangered Balkan lynx.

— Bayarjargal Agvaantseren of Mongolia, who led the fight to create the 2,800 square miles (7,300 square kilometers) Tost Tosonbumba Nature Reserve. It is the country's only federal reserve for snow leopard conservation.

— Jacqueline Evans of the Cook Islands, whose work led to the conservation and sustainable management of all 763,000 square miles (1.98 million square kilometers) of the Cook Islands' ocean territory and creation of 15 marine protected areas.

— Alberto Curamil of Chile, a jailed indigenous activist who had protested several hydroelectric projects in the country. His efforts were credited with halting two projects and protecting a critical ecosystem surrounding the Cautin River.

Despite Brownell's campaign, palm oil development remains a threat in Liberia as mostly Southeast Asia companies move to expand their operations beyond Malaysia and Indonesia to West Africa.

Golden Veroleum, one of the largest palm oil companies in the country, still holds the concession it signed with the government in 2010 to develop 800 square miles (2,000 square kilometers). Kaybee said the company is confident it will able to develop ""a significant part"" of the land in its concession while conserving forests.

Supporters say Brownell deserves much of the credit for forcing palm oil companies to change the way they do business in Liberia.

""He has compelled the oil palm companies to undertake robust diligence. He changed the mindset of oil palm companies operating in Liberia forever,"" said Francis Colee, head of programming for the nongovernment organization Green Advocates International that Brownell founded. ""Everywhere, the oil palm companies are now trying to uphold their international commitments or deforestation rules.""

Goldfish weighing just ONE GRAM becomes UK's smallest ever surgery patient,Tiny goldfish weighing just ONE GRAM becomes UK's smallest ever surgery patient as vet removes tumor from its belly in 40-minute operation,1.0,"A goldfish weighing just one gram has become the UK's smallest ever surgery patient after vets removed a tumour from its abdomen.

Molly the fish was rushed into the practice after its owners noticed a large lump on its belly.

Staff at Highscoft Vets in Bristol immediately diagnosed a tumour and prepared Molly for surgery.

The emergency procedure saw vets catheterise the goldfish's mouth before anaesthetising Molly and remove the mass within 40 minutes.

The vets, who normally operate on the likes of iguanas, snakes and crocodiles, says the goldfish is the smallest animal to go under the knife.

Molly the goldfish is shown lying in a water solution with a catheter placed in its mouth to keep it alive during the delicate procedure

The emergency procedure saw vets catheterise the goldfish's mouth before anaesthetising Molly (shown here) and remove the mass within 40 minutes

The operation, which cost the owners less than £100, was hailed a success after Molly woke up within minutes of the anaesthetic being stopped and returned home the same day.

Exotic species vet Sonya Miles said: 'It's not common across the UK to bring your fish to the vets but it is here. We are seeing more and more fish which is great.

'It used to be the odd one or two every few months but more and more people are realising we are happy to see them.

'Although it looks like a goldfish its actually an exotic fish from the molly species although it does look incredibly like a goldfish.

'A couple had been given the molly fish by an elderly neighbour but after a few weeks they noticed a lump on her underbelly and brought her in.

'It was definitely the smallest animal we've seen here. It barely registered on our scales.

Molly the fish was rushed into the practice after its owners noticed a large lump on its belly (circled above)

The operation, which cost less than £100, was hailed a success after Molly woke up within minutes of the anaesthetic being stopped and returned home the same day

'Both modern and veterinary medicine has advanced over time so we're able to perform

'It's a pretty simple procedure and took no longer than thirty or forty minutes. We submerged the fish in a container of anaesthetic solution.

'Once the righting reflex is lost and the fish is asleep it was the laid on the operating area.

'The fish is kept wet, the mouth is catheterised and different concentrations of anaesthetic are injected over the gills to keep the fish at a stable level of anaesthesia.

'The area covered with a water proof paste as stitching the skin closed isn't a possibility. The fish was then woken up in fresh oxygenated water.

'The operation was a success as we were able to remove the tumour before it started to upset its balance.

'You definitely have to have steady hands and good eyesight. It was definitely a team effort.

'We're glad to have been able to help the fish before the tumour started to upset its balance.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7472969/Goldfish-weighing-just-ONE-GRAM-UKs-smallest-surgery-patient.html

But Max didn’t actually see that as an option and stuck by her through two years of treatment.No matter who you are or where you live, life seems to give a fair share of lemons to everyone. It could be a single fruit or an enormous handful but you can be sure of one thing only – you will definitely get it. Jillian Hanson from New Jersey got her handful when she found out she had cancer.

"This undersea robot just delivered 100,000 baby corals to the Great Barrier Reef","This undersea robot just delivered 100,000 baby corals to the Great Barrier Reef",1.0,"With oceans growing warmer and more acidic as a result of climate change, the world’s coral reefs are under siege. Recent research shows that the number of coral bleaching events has risen drastically in recent years, and in 2016 and 2017 about half of the coral making up Australia’s Great Barrier Reef died off.

But researchers at two Australian universities have developed an underwater robot that could help turn the tide in the ongoing struggle to save at-risk reefs. The briefcase-size submersible, dubbed LarvalBot, is designed to move autonomously along damaged sections of reef, seeding them with hundreds of thousands of microscopic baby corals.

“The reduced number of corals means we’ve lost the ability for coral to provide enough larvae to settle and restore these communities quickly,” said Peter Harrison, director of the Marine Ecology Research Centre at Southern Cross University and the leader of the coral restoration project. “The idea here is to use an automated technique that allows us to target delivery of the larvae into damaged reef systems and increase the efficiency that new coral communities can be generated.”

Harrison’s team recently tested LarvalBot at Vlasoff Reef, an outer part of the Great Barrier Reef along Australia’s northeastern coast. In the trial run, the submersible dispersed 100,000 baby specimens derived from corals that survived the bleaching event of 2016-17, which are believed to be especially tolerant of warmer ocean temperatures.

Future versions of the bot should be able to disperse millions of baby corals in order to speed the regrowth of damaged reefs, Harrison said, adding that the team is also planning to test LarvalBot on a reef in the Philippines.

But the researchers will have to wait and see if the microscopic baby corals take hold.

“We can’t actually see the results of these experiments until we start to see juvenile corals grow — so, for at least six to nine months,” Harrison said. “What we’ll be doing now is monitoring the reef over the coming months.”

LarvalBot is based on another submersible robot known as RangerBot, which was designed not to deliver babies but to kill a coral-eating species of starfish. RangerBot was developed and built by Matthew Dunbabin, an engineering and robotics professor at Queensland University of Technology, who also reworked the RangerBot to carry the baby corals.

Harrison hopes to eventually develop a fleet of LarvalBots that would be used to repopulate reefs around the world, though he is unsure how much such a project would cost.

Mark Eakin, the College Park, Maryland-based coordinator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Coral Reef Watch program, called Harrison's project an ""excellent idea"" but questioned the effectiveness of underwater robots in tackling a global problem like coral loss.

“The area of coral reefs hit by significant mortality is about the size of the state of West Virginia,” Eakin said. “Now, imagine dividing the state of West Virginia across the entire Pacific Ocean. We need to be doing everything we can to protect coral reefs, but we have to keep in mind that this problem is absolutely huge compared to what these robots can do.”

Eakin said saving reefs will ultimately require addressing the root cause of the problem: climate change.

“Even if this technology is scaled up, if we don’t deal with climate change, it won’t be enough,” he said. “It’s like coming up with a robot to replant trees after the devastating wildfires that just happened. It’s not addressing how to stop the wildfires in the first place.”

Canada reports no new deaths from coronavirus for the first time since March,Canada reports no new deaths from coronavirus for the first time since March,1.0,"Canada reported no new deaths from COVID-19 on Friday for the first time in six months. The last time the country reported no new deaths from the virus on March 15, at the start of lockdowns in North America due to the pandemic, Reuters reports.

As of Friday evening, over 6 million people had been tested for COVID-19 in Canada, 2.1% of which came back positive. Some 702 new cases were reported on Friday, but no new deaths, the Public Health Agency of Canada reported.

According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, Quebec reported one new death on September 11, but Ontario removed a previously reported death. That meant the number of deaths reported, 9,163, remained unchanged from the previous day.

As the numbers improve, ""I am reminded of the ways Canadians have pulled together to reduce the spread of COVID-19,"" Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada's Chief Public Health Officer, said Thursday in a statement. ""We have been physically apart from each other in order to plank the curve, but we have found new ways to be together, and connected, while at a distance.""

The majority of cases, 80.0%, and deaths, 93.7%, have been reported by Ontario and Quebec.

Coronavirus fatalities spiked in April and steadily increased until July, data from the country's health department shows, before starting to plateau over the summer. 71.3% of deaths in Canada were people over the age of 80.

Several Canadian provinces have started easing lockdown restrictions, as schools reopen for in-person classes, resulting in a recent spike in cases.

Compared to the U.S., its southern neighbor, Canada has had fewer coronavirus infections and deaths. The country has 137,676 COVID-19 cases and 9,214 deaths as of Saturday, according to Johns Hopkins University.

Comparatively, the U.S. surpassed 6.4 million cases and 193,000 deaths as of Saturday.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/canada-zero-coronavirus-covid-deaths-first-time/
Coke and Pepsi abandon the plastics lobby,Coke & Pepsi to end partnership with Plastics Industry Association Lobby - increasing recycling & reusability goals.,1.0,"New York (CNN Business) Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, two major sellers of plastic bottles, have made sweeping sustainability commitments . Now they are stepping away from a plastics lobbying group .

Both soft drink companies are trying to increase the amount of recycled plastic they use in bottles. They want to improve recycling infrastructure and ensure their packages are recyclable.

But the Plastics Industry Association has ties to the American Progressive Bag Alliance, which encourages states to make plastic bans illegal. Participation in the association could tarnish Coca-Cola and Pepsi's images as companies working to find solutions to plastic pollution.

The association took positions that ""were not fully consistent with our commitments and goals,"" Coca-Cola said in a statement last week, noting that it withdrew from the group earlier this year. Pepsi said it had joined the association to learn about innovation as it works to ""achieve a circular economy for plastics.""

""We do not participate in the policy advocacy work of the association or its subsidiaries, and our membership will conclude at the end of this year,"" Pepsi said.

Coke and Pepsi ""made the wrong choice"" by being a part of the lobbying organization, said Dianna Cohen, CEO of the nonprofit Plastic Pollution Coalition. The optics of membership, she added, ""are really bad.""

Plastic pollution is a major problem.

Cutting ties with the Plastic Industry Association is a sign that ""companies understand that they cannot publicly say they want to end plastic pollution, while financially supporting an association that lobbies for our continued reliance on throwaway plastics,"" said Greenpeace USA Oceans Campaign Director John Hocevar in a statement.

The move may help reassure some customers. But as people grow more worried about the negative impacts of plastic pollution on the environment as well as on animal and human health, companies like Pepsi and Coke will have to go even further to find a solution.

Tackling plastic pollution

Both companies are trying to figure out ways to reduce their use of virgin plastics and increase recycling. They're also exploring alternatives to plastics, like aluminum, that are easier to recycle.

PepsiCo announced recently that its Aquafina-brand water will be sold in aluminum cans at US fast food and restaurant chains as soon as next year. The company is testing out a broader rollout to retail stores.

""Tackling plastic waste is one of my top priorities and I take this challenge personally,"" PepsiCo CEO Ramon Laguarta said at the time. ""We are doing our part to address the issue head on by reducing, recycling and reinventing our packaging."" Pepsi has committed to using only recyclable, compostable or biodegradable packaging by 2025, and it's pledged to make new plastic bottles using 25% recycled material.

Plus, Coca-Cola last year launched a World Without Waste initiative that encompasses its recycling goals , which include collecting and recycling the equivalent of every bottle or can it sells by 2030. The company has also committed to making its bottles and cans out of at least 50% recycled material in the next 11 years.

The companies are also exploring refill stations that eliminate single-use packaging altogether.

Pepsi is selling a high-tech water cooler that lets customers fill up their own bottles with flavored or unflavored, still or carbonated water in varying temperatures. Coca-Cola has launched a similar product for Dasani on college campuses.

Leaving the lobby

Those initiatives made membership in the plastics trade group problematic, at least from a PR standpoint. The Plastics Industry Association is not only a lobbying group. Some of its initiatives, like helping recycling, may overlap with those of Coke and Pepsi.

""Our members work together to align their efforts to put recycling and sustainability at the forefront of their businesses,"" said Patty Long, interim president and CEO of the Plastics Industry Association, in a statement.

The plastics association says it does not itself lobby for legislation that bans plastic or hold an official position on those laws. It says that it operate separately from the bag alliance and has different memberships and dues.

But a page on the association's website redirects to the bag alliance site, and the contact email for the bag alliance has the same suffix as the association's. An association representative declined to share how the groups are connected.

Activists started pressuring Coke, Pepsi, and other companies to leave the plastic association last year.

The shareholder activist group As You Sow and Walden Asset Management called attention last year to corporate involvement with the Plastic Industry Association, and wrote letters to the CEOs of Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, among others.

This year, Greenpeace also drew a line between the Plastic Industry Association and anti-plastic ban laws.

The plastics association said Greenpeace is responsible for companies' withdrawal from the group.

""We are aware that several prominent brands that are members of the association have been targeted by a persistent Greenpeace activist campaign to pressure them to leave our association,"" Long said, calling the efforts ""unfortunate.""

"The Last Of The Whales Have Finally Been Freed From Russia's Notorious ""Whale Jail""","The Last Of The Whales Have Finally Been Freed From Russia's Notorious ""Whale Jail""",1.0,"Russia’s notorious “whale jail” is no more.

Following a huge international backlash, the last of the belugas housed at the “whale jail” on Russia’s Far East coast have been released into the wild, according to a statement from the Russian Federal Research Institute of Fisheries and Oceanography (VNIRO). An estimated 10 orcas and 87 beluga whales were once held at the facility, which consisted of cramped, ice-covered enclosures in a gloomy bay near the Pacific port of Nakhodka.

The situation first made headlines in November 2018 when conservationists shared drone footage of the whales’ enclosures (video below). The video quickly went viral, sparking an international outcry from activists and even some high-profile celebrities, including Leonardo DiCaprio. The Russian government was relatively receptive to the criticism, with President Vladimir Putin himself asking his government to investigate the whale enclosures.

Following a lengthy investigation, prosecutors eventually deemed the enclosures illegal and ordered the company to release the whales, along with a fine of 28.1 million rubles ($432,000).

-

The whales have since been steadily released in several batches starting in early summer, with the last of the orcas being freed in August. On November 10, 2019, authorities stated that the release of the last belugas into the Bay of Uspeniya had been completed successfully.

“During transportation, the animals behaved calmly, their behavior was monitored by scientists, veterinarians and experienced trainers,” VNIRO said in a statement. “Three large individuals have satellite tags that will allow scientists to monitor the movement of animals in the wild.”

However, the move has received some criticism. Conservation group Free Russian Whales notes that two of the belugas that were being transported currently remain unaccounted for. The Whale Sanctuary Project also argues that the choice of location, the Bay of Uspeniya, could put whales at risk of poaching and natural hazards.

“This outcome is not ideal for the belugas, since this is not their normal habitat or the area where they were captured,” Jean-Michel Cousteau and Charles Vinick of the Whale Sanctuary Project said in a statement. “Nonetheless, we trust the intention of Russian government authorities to release the belugas, despite limitations due to the availability of ships, inadequate finances, and weather conditions.”

“We also hope that visual monitoring will help reduce concerns about threats from North Korean fishing vessels that we understand are poaching in the area and that the Russian government will do what is necessary to protect the belugas from repeat capture.”

While the situation might not be ideal, a worse fate was facing the captured orcas and belugas. It’s thought the animals were illegally caught last year to be sold to marine parks and aquariums in China, where the captive orca park industry is booming.",https://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/the-last-of-the-whales-have-finally-been-freed-from-russias-notorious-whale-jail-/
Crossroads Church leverages donations to wipe out $46.5 million in medical debt,Church wipes out $46.5 million in medical debt,1.0,"Crossroads Church senior pastor Brian Tome mentioned the campaign nearly in passing.

He spent about three minutes describing the burden of medical debt during his Nov. 23 sermon, entitled “The Marks of Multiplication.” Tome said members of the congregation could text “MULTIPLY” to 313131 to help “free others from medical debt,” but insisted the campaign was not a challenge.

Just an awareness.

It was also a great metaphor for his lesson on multiplicity.

“When we are in debt, a sin debt to God, we can’t get our way out of the sin debt to God,” he said during the sermon. “Jesus comes and gives himself so we can pay off our sin debt, so we never have to worry about God hurting us for our sin.”

Crossroads could give to free others' debt, too, he said. And for every dollar they raised, Crossroad's partner RIP Medical Debt would leverage that dollar to abolish $100 in medical debt, therefore multiplying the church's impact.

Within a week and a half, members of the Crossroads community donated enough to abolish over $46.5 million in medical debt nationwide.

Over $42 million of those funds came back to Ohio families.

“Most of it probably that weekend,” said Crossroads director of marketing Brennan Hill. “'Cause I think most people, if I had to guess, were doing it in real time. You know, if they were literally getting their phones out and texting in.”

Church officials announced the impact of their campaign Sunday morning.

Most of the funds came back to Ohio families since the church is based out of the Cincinnati region. But the sermons are streamed online, which means anyone in the nation can tune in and participate.

RIP Medical Debt is able to track the donations back to their original ZIP codes to give back. So, if you donated from Indiana, your donation was multiplied and given back to your community in Indiana.

In Ohio, church officials say, they have abolished $42.8 million in debts across 41,233 households in 103 ZIP codes.

They also abolished $1.9 million in debt across 2,974 Kentucky households, $1.5 million across 503 Tennessee households and $200,000 across 136 Indiana households.

What is RIP Medical Debt?

An article posted by USA Today last year explains that RIP Medical Debt is a nonprofit organization based out of Rye, New York, that arranges debt payoffs.

The article said medical debt contributes to two-thirds of bankruptcies, according to the American Journal of Public Health. And a 2018 Kaiser Family Foundation/New York Times poll showed that of the 26 percent of people who reported problems paying medical bills, 59 percent reported a major life impact, such as taking an extra job, cutting other household spending or using up savings.

“How sad that probably the only debt that you don’t choose to get – 'cause you don’t choose to get sick – and it’s the one that’s affecting most people,"" said Victor Martinez, spiritual growth site leader for the Oakley location.

When a person can’t pay a bill, that debt is often packaged with other people’s debt and sold to bill collectors for some fraction of the total amount of the bill. RIP Medical Debt buys debt portfolios on this secondary market for pennies on the dollar with money from its donors.

But instead of collecting the debt, RIP forgives it.

To be eligible for repayment from RIP, the debtor must be earning less than twice the federal poverty level (about $25,000 a year for an individual and $52,000 for a family of four), have debts that are 5 percent or more of their annual income and have more debt than assets.

Because hospitals and doctors are eager to get those hard-to-collect debts off their books, they sell them cheap.

Working this way puts a high-dollar project within reach of even small churches. Revolution Annapolis, a nondenominational Maryland church with Sunday attendance of around 200 and without a permanent building, wiped out $1.9 million in debt for 900 families in March. Total amount raised: $15,000.

A debt that never goes away... even if you don't know about it

According to the Federal Trade Commission, debt collectors have a certain number of years they can sue you and win to collect a debt. This rule is called the statute of limitations, and is six years in Ohio.

This means that for any type of debt, a creditor cannot sue a debtor for debt collection purposes after six years, according to America's Debt Help Organization. That timeframe begins when someone fails to make a payment on a debt. The clock will start again if you make a payment or provide written acknowledgment of your debt after the first six years are up.

Martinez says that because of this law, many people who got a letter explaining that their debt had been abolished thanks to Crossroads didn't even know they had medical debt. If it was after those six years, hospitals and debt collectors had stopped calling.

“If those six years pass, then nobody can give you a call asking for that money,"" Martinez said. ""But you still owe that money, technically. And the only way that you can really get rid of it is if you file bankruptcy, or if you pay for it.”

Medical debt never goes away. It will stay on your record if you don't pay it. The law just states that if you don't pay it within that six year window, people will stop asking you to pay – not that you are off the hook.

Martinez said that now that he understands how the law works, he's afraid to call and ask if he owes anything. Because, what if he owes a lot of money? He'll be accountable to pay it, he said.

“That is very scary,"" he said. ""Because what if I have medical debt that I don’t know about?”

'A great analogy to what Jesus did for us.'

Crossroads officials did not want this story to be about them.

“We kept it off social media,"" Hill said. ""We really want it to be about people in our community, like I said, who are currently giving.”

Crossroads members don't know who specifically they have impacted. They could not choose whose debt to pay off. In a letter to each debtor, Crossroads explained the campaign and said that they hope to provide more resources for those in need, whether that is through prayer or connecting them with healthcare professionals in their community.

“We don’t want this to be the last interaction that we have with them, but there are no strings attached,"" Hill said.""We just hope that they understand who Crossroads is, what our heart is for the community, maybe set foot in one of our sites.”

This whole experience has been a great analogy to what Jesus did for us, Martinez said.

""Jesus, before we knew who he was, he died for us, to forgive our debt,"" Martinez said. ""And here, we don’t know who these people are, and we are putting this money for their debt to be forgiven.""

According to RIP Medical Debt, Crossroads' campaign is its largest amount of medical debt that's ever been retired. The nonprofit's site claims that its partnerships have erased almost $1.4 billion in medical debt to date.

An Arizona man challenged 'bored teens' to pick up trash — and it went viral,An Arizona man challenged 'bored teens' to pick up trash — and it went viral,1.0,"Read Story Transcript

Last week, Arizona's Byron Román posted before-and-after photos of a guy sitting in the middle of a wooded area.

The first picture shows the ground strewn with garbage. In the second picture, the ground is clean, all that garbage neatly collected into nine trash bags.

The post included a challenge to ""all you bored teens out there"" to follow his lead and collect trash at a nearby area requiring a bit of clean-up.

Since then, the so-called Trash Tag Challenge has gone viral.

""I just posted a photo for my friends to see, which is something I do every day just some inspirational, motivational words of wisdom I guess,"" he told As It Happens host Carol Off.

The Phoenix man's original post has been shared more than 300,000 times, and groups from all over the world have added their own before-and-after shots of their clean-up attempts.

""I came up with the 'bored teens' because lately all you see online is all these challenges of people jumping out of cars ... or the Tide Pod challenge, eating soap,"" he said.

""But if they're bored and doing something silly and dangerous, then they should do something positive for the Earth.""

At first, it was just a few likes and shares from Román's friends.

""As the day went along it just kept snowballing,"" he said. ""I think people saw it and liked the message.""

But Román wants to be clear that he didn't come up with the challenge — and it's not him in the original photo that he shared.

I think that trash tag is amazing - so cool to see all the people picking up their communities. I don’t do it in any sort of organized group or anything, because I prefer the quiet solitude of picking up a dozen bags of trash with just the wildlife in the mangroves as company 😍 <a href=""https://t.co/rsErq4G58M"">pic.twitter.com/rsErq4G58M</a> —@bobbydevito

The initiative was originally started by an environmental lighting company called UCO when their employee Steven Reinhold vowed to pick up 100 pieces of trash while out on a road trip.

Often when something like this goes viral, people will just share the original images without actually participating or contributing themselves.

But the #TrashTag (or #Basura, in Spanish) Challenge seems to have inspired action.

""Some of the participants are schoolteachers and they showed the picture to their students and encouraged them to go out and keep areas clean,"" Román said.

""It was very shocking and overwhelming for me to think, wow, people are doing what I suggested. And not just teens — it was all ages.""

Before and after. Makeup and clothes dumped near Moston Brook, now cleaned up 😀<a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/litterpick?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#litterpick</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/TrashTag?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#TrashTag</a> <a href=""https://t.co/9GsFIUORaI"">pic.twitter.com/9GsFIUORaI</a> —@AJDelusion

Given the typical life cycle of a viral meme, it's likely that the #TrashTag challenge will lose momentum at some point.

But Román thinks that the good generated by the meme so far will continue.

""At least the goal was met where an area was clean. I think more people are likely to keep an area clean,"" he said.

""So hopefully by cleaning up and keeping an area clean people will have pride and ownership of the planet and do more things about it and not get it dirty again.""

Several companies still paying Puerto Rico employees despite closed stores after hurricanes,Some companies still paying Puerto Rico employees despite closed stores after hurricanes,1.0," -- Some companies with locations in Puerto Rico, where hurricanes have caused unprecedented death and destruction and power is not yet restored in many areas, have continued paying their employees despite store closures.

TJX, the parent company of T.J. Maxx, Home Goods, and Marshalls, J.C. Penney and Luxottica, the eyewear company behind Lenscrafters and Pearle Vision, have continued to pay employees based in Puerto Rico, even though some locations remain closed.

""We believe it is the right thing for us to do under these circumstances,"" TJX said in a statement to ABC News.

J.C.Penney continued paying employees, issuing cash paychecks while access to operable banks and ATMs were limited, J.C. Penney said in a statement to ABC News.

Nordstrom and Starbucks have also paid their employees while Puerto Rico locations have been closed in the wake of the hurricane destruction.

""We’re working to find opportunities to transfer employees who are interested in staying with the company and will offer some relocation assistance to any employee who needs it,"" Nordstrom said in a statement to ABC News.

Starbucks has started an employee assistance fund specifically for workers whose homes and families have been destroyed by the hurricanes in Puerto Rico.

Hurricane Maria made landfall as a Category 4 hurricane on Sept. 20, destroying communities on the island after Hurricane Irma struck just a couple of weeks before.

A viral Facebook post under the hashtag “PuertoRicoStrong” highlighted some help that TJX provided their employees.

A father thanked the Marshalls parent company for continuing to pay his son even though the store where he worked has closed. He also wrote that the company gave his son supplies.

TJX did not disclose how many of its 29 locations in Puerto Rico have been closed.

Four of J.C.Penney's seven locations on the island remain closed and the company said employees of those stores are still being paid.

The company said it also delivered supplies, like water, food, and generators, for all 1,300 associates.

Nordstrom, the luxury department store chain, also paid Puerto Rico store associates after the devastation forced their one location on the island to close until further notice.

They company paid employees through Nov. 4th and then offered them a separation package. The employees had been receiving checks since the stores closed on Sept. 19th in anticipation of the storm, Nordstrom told ABC News in a statement. After the destruction, the company donated to relief efforts in addition to using its company employee relief fund.

The Nordstrom location will be closed until further notice because of hurricane damage.

Luxottica's eyewear brands have a sizable presence on the island -- 46 locations that include Oakley, Sunglass Hut, Lenscrafters, and Pearle Vision.

Despite thirty locations that remain closed, all 200 employees are being paid. Luxottica also started a Guardian Angel Fund to which company employees everywhere can make donations matched by the company, Luxottica told ABC News in a statement.

Starbucks Corp. initiated a similar effort called the Starbucks Puerto Rico Tacita Verde Fund, along with Baristas del Cairbe, a Puerto Rican coffee company that is a subsidiary of Empressas Fonalledas Inc. that licenses Starbucks on the island.

The program is a new fund for employee assistance that provides financial grants to employees and their families who need urgent home repairs, food and medical help, among other critical needs, Starbucks said in a statement to ABC News.

All Starbucks employees received temporary disaster pay the first week. Employees from still-closed locations have been moved to stores that have reopened.

In the statement, Starbucks said that 18 of its 24 locations have reopened, but they are keeping hours flexible for employees' safety amid the loss of power supply on the island.

Puerto Rico’s goal is to restore electricity for half of the island by mid-November and for 95 percent by mid-December, according to Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossello.",http://abcnews.go.com/US/companies-paying-puerto-rico-employees-closed-stores-hurricanes/story?id=50986272&cid=social_fb_abcn&
How San Francisco sends less trash to the landfill than any other major U.S. city,"San Francisco sends less trash to the landfill than any other major U.S. city - The city diverts about 80 percent of its waste from landfills, or more than 1.5 million tons every year. San Francisco aims to reach zero waste by 2020.",1.0,"The average American produces about 4.4 pounds of waste per day. Roughly 1.5 pounds of that is composted or recycled, meaning the U.S. avoids sending just 34 percent of its waste to landfills, according to the EPA. San Francisco provides a much different narrative. Thanks to bold public policy and educational initiatives, the city diverts about 80 percent of its waste from landfills, or more than 1.5 million tons every year. Ultimately, San Francisco aims to reach zero waste. That means recycling, composting, reusing, and reducing consumption so that nothing goes to either the landfill or incineration. The city hopes to achieve this goal by 2020. But even if it doesn’t, San Francisco is already way ahead of other cities. For example, New York only diverts about 21 percent of its waste and Chicago is at about 10 percent.

How has San Francisco done it?

In 2009, San Francisco made recycling and composting a requirement for all businesses and residences. It passed the nation’s first mandatory composting law, and while a few progressive cities have followed suite, most haven't. San Francisco also banned environmentally hazardous items like checkout bags and Styrofoam. Debbie Raphael, director of the San Francisco Department of the Environment, said she's proud of how the city has used market incentives to drive behavior.

“If we can't ban the materials sometimes we'll put a charge on it,"" she said. ""We might ban a plastic bag and put a charge on using a single-use paper bag, because we're sending signals to the producers and to the users, to the consumers, that there's an easy, convenient, right way to do things.” To encourage behavior change, San Francisco initially set trash collection rates much higher than recycling and composting rates. While rates are more comparable now, residential bin sizes provide a behavioral nudge. Standard residential services include a 64-gallon blue recycling bin, a 32-gallon green composting bin, and 16-gallon black trash bin. Businesses are also charged according to the volume of waste they present. They receive discounts for using the green and blue bins, and are penalized if recyclables or compostables end up in the trash. Another key to San Francisco’s success is its exclusive partnership with waste management company Recology. Raphael said that working with one company eases the administrative burden and makes it possible to collaborate on long-term goals. New York, by comparison, has a private system for commercial waste, comprised of hundreds of competing waste collection companies. This makes it challenging for the local government to collaborate on citywide initiatives.

Behind the scenes

The final element that sets San Francisco’s apart is the sheer scale of its recycling and composting operations. All of the city's recyclables are brought to Recycle Center, a 200,000 square foot warehouse on Pier 96 that processes 40 to 45 tons of materials per hour. A team of 14 people work alongside high-tech screens, magnets and optical sorters to weed out contamination and separate the paper, metals and plastics. Similar materials are placed in a bale together, and shipped out to recycling plants both domestically and abroad. As for the compost, all of the city’s yard waste and food scraps are brought to Jepson Prairie Organics in Vacaville, about 60 miles northeast of San Francisco. Here, compostables are weighed, ground up and blended. Eventually, the nutrient-rich product is sold as fertilizer to vineyards in wine country and nut growers in the Central Valley.

Greg Pryor, general manager of Jepson Prairie, said this was one of the first facilities in the U.S. to compost food scraps. “When we started in ‘94-’95 with food, there wasn't anybody doing it on a commercial scale that we were processing, and a lot of naysayers in the beginning,"" he said. ""Today they can't argue with our success. It can be done.” Both Recycle Central and Jepson Prairie host national and international visitors, who are eager to learn how they can replicate San Francisco’s success. While San Francisco’s waste management system costs about $300 million annually, the program is funded solely through waste collection fees, which are no higher than average for the Bay Area. Furthermore, a complex recycling and composting operation can be an engine for job growth. Raphael said that for each ton of material, 20 more jobs are created when you recycle than if you put that material in a landfill.

"Muslim-led fundraiser nets $150,000 for funeral costs of synagogue shooting victims","Muslim-led fundraiser nets $150,000 for funeral costs of synagogue shooting victims",1.0,"NEW YORK — A fundraiser organized by two Muslim-American groups for the victims of Saturday's deadly shooting in a Pittsburgh synagogue reached its goal of raising $150,000 from about 3,600 donors in just over 48 hours. Some of the money is already on the way to victims and their families, and organizers say they hope to cover the funeral costs for all 11 people who were killed.

The fundraiser on the site LaunchGood is a joint effort by the groups Celebrate Mercy and MPower Change. It reached its initial goal of $25,000 in just under six hours after being launched Saturday afternoon, according to Tarek El-Messidi, founder of Celebrate Mercy, a group that teaches about the prophet Mohammed through education and charitable campaigns. The fundraiser welcomes contributions from donors regardless of faith.

""Initially it was intended to be a gesture of solidarity,"" said Linda Sarsour, the co-founder of MPower Change, in an interview with CBS News on Monday. ""We wanted to give more than just 'thoughts and prayers.'""

The organizers increased the fundraising goal several times to reflect the outpouring of giving, according to the fundraising page. On Monday morning, organizers transferred $25,000 via PayPal to the Islamic Center of Pittsburgh (ICP) for families of the victims at Tree of Life Congregation, the synagogue targeted in Saturday's attack. Another transfer is planned for Tuesday morning, according to El-Messidi.

""Right now, because in Jewish tradition funerals happen right away, the priority is to help with funeral expenses,"" El-Messidi said Monday. The group hopes to cover the entirety of all funeral expenses for each of the victims, El-Messidi said, noting that Jewish funerals in the Pittsburgh area cost roughly $10,000.

Wasi Mohamed, the executive director of the ICP, said Monday that the center was in touch with the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh, Tree of Life and local funeral homes to figure out how to distribute the funds.

""Pittsburgh is such a tight knit community and the Islamic Center of Pittsburgh are true friends of the Jewish community here,"" Josh Sayles, director of the Jewish Federation's community relations council, said in an interview. ""They have stepped up for us in countless ways. There's few things keeping us going right now, but this is at the top of the list.""

The fundraiser surpassed its goal of $150,000 on Monday evening. Organizers had said the goal wouldn't be increased unless the short-term needs of the victims' families exceed that amount, but kept the page open for donations beyond the $150,000 goal, saying any extra funds would be used only on ""projects that help foster Muslim-Jewish collaboration and solidarity.""

There are no limitations on how victims and families can use the money, Sarsour said.

LaunchGood, the crowdsourcing site hosting the campaign, is a five-year-old Muslim-centered platform for grassroot fundraising efforts. Unlike similar sites like GoFundMe, LaunchGood does not publish the names of donors or how much they give, reflecting a belief in Islam that ""the right hand gives, the left hand doesn't know,"" Sarsour said.

""In Islam, the idea of charity is something to strengthen your relationship with God,"" Sarsour said. ""It's supposed to be something that's secret. You're not suppose to flaunt it.""

Other groups have also been moved to charity after Saturday's shooting. A GoFundMe campaign supporting Tree of Life had raised over $742,000 from more than 12,000 donors as of Monday evening. The fundraiser was launched by GoFundMe user Shay Khatiri, an Iranian immigrant living in Washington, D.C., according to his GoFundMe profile.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pittsburgh-shooting-muslim-led-launchgood-fundraiser-raises-money-for-funeral-costs-of-synagogue-shooting-victims/

Owl hit and caught in SUV survives,Owl hit and caught in SUV Survives - “Will make a full recovery”,1.0,"Tahoe, the snowy owl, got his moniker with a bang, one so strong it caught him in the vehicle for which he's been dubbed.

Salthaven West, a Regina wildlife rehabilitation centre, often responds to reports of injured animals, but Thursday night's call was different from the norm, according to director Megan Lawrence.

""It's definitely common that owls and other wildlife get hit by vehicles, but this is the first time we've ever attended where one's still been stuck inside the vehicle after being hit,"" she said.

A driver was travelling south of Regina along the highway when she saw the owl fly into her SUV, and assumed the worst for the bird. After driving a few minutes into the city, she stopped to see if there was damage to the truck.

What she discovered instead was the bright white plumage of a snowy owl, caught within the grille of her Tahoe. She immediately called for assistance, with a local conservation officer contacting Lawrence to respond.

Salthaven West shared pictures of the snowy owl that was caught in the grille of a Tahoe, with people sending wishes for his speedy recovery. (Salthaven West/Instagram)

""The faster we get an animal for treatment, the better chance it has for recovery,"" Lawrence said. ""So I'm lucky I was just able to get over there right away and get him out.""

Rescue mission

With Thursday's temperatures dipping to as low as –30 C, Lawrence staged a frigid, but fast-acting rescue. Owls can typically be quite aggressive, but with the owl putting up little fight, Lawrence could tell he was badly injured.

When we first got him, he spent a lot of time laying down and now he's standing up all the time, which is a great sign. - Megan Lawrence, Salthaven West

She performed a brief triage before getting him to the Animal Clinic of Regina, where it was confirmed his wing was fractured. Of concern, however, was the severe head trauma he sustained, with a concussion making his recovery touch-and-go. Fortunately, things seem to be looking up.

""Over the last 48 hours, he's made great improvements,"" Lawrence said. ""When we first got him, he spent a lot of time laying down and now he's standing up all the time, which is a great sign.""

Recovery journey begins

The young male, whom they've been calling Tahoe, is in for at least a six-week minimum recovery period while his bone heals and stabilizes. Before being released, he will be given test flights to ensure he is strong, healthy and not suffering permanent vision damage as a result of concussion.

But Lawrence says she's cautiously optimistic Tahoe will make a full recovery.

""I think everyone involved made a difference and will definitely contribute towards getting him healthy and back out to the wild.""",http://www.cbc.ca/beta/news/canada/saskatchewan/owl-hit-and-caught-in-suv-survives-1.4468624
This Clerk Pays School Fees Of 45 Students In Memory Of His Daughter,Indian clerk funds school fees of 45 underprivileged girls in daughters memory.,1.0,"It is said that when you desire something truly, then the entire universe will find a way to make it happen. So it did for 45 girls from Kalaburagi, Karnataka. Mr Basavaraj, fondly called ‘God’ by these 45 girls, is paying for their education.

Mr Basavaraj works as a clerk at MPHS Govt High School in Kalaburagi’s Maktampura. He is sponsoring the education of 45 children.

ANI reported that last year, Basavaraj lost his daughter due to some health issues. As a tribute to Dhaneshwari, his daughter, he started paying for other children’s education in the school.

Speaking to ANI, Mr Basavaraj, said, “From this year I have started paying the fees of poor girls who study in this school.”

Humbled by his act of kindness, one of the students said, “We belong to poor families and the fees which we can’t pay is paid by our Basavaraj sir in memory of his late daughter. We wish his daughter rests in peace,” said Fathima, one of the girls whose education is being sponsored by Mr Basavaraj.

The Logical Indian community appreciates Mr Basavaraj and wishes that her daughter rests in peace. We are sure that she would have been proud of her father’s beautiful way of honouring her memory.

France is offering US scientists 4-year grants to move to the country and do research,France is offering US scientists 4-year grants to move to the country and do research on climate change via a website called Make Our Planet Great Again.,1.0,"If you are an American scientist, student, teacher, or business person working on climate change solutions, France would love for you to stay awhile.

Following President Trump's June 2 decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement - a multi-country pact that acknowledges global warming poses serious threats to humanity and the environment - the French government has created an outlet for people from all countries who still want to fight climate change.

The website is called Make Our Planet Great Again Researchers, teachers, and students can apply for a four-year grant that allows them to continue their studies or instruction, fully financed. The site also provides information on how to move to France by obtaining a work visa and residency permit.

The website explains: ""You will be able to stay in France at least for the duration of the grant, and longer if you are granted a permanent position. There is no restriction on your husband / wife working in France. If you have children, note that French public schools are free, and the tuition fees of universities and 'grandes écoles' are very low compared to the American system.""

Businesspeople and heads of NGOs can also apply to receive funding from the federal government, which issues grants to organizations it considers deserving.

Emmanuel Macron won the French presidential election May 7. Since his victory, a video his campaign posted in February has been making the rounds on American social media. The Facebook video was addressed to American climate scientists who feel alienated by the Trump administration. Looking straight into the camera, speaking English, Macron tells American ""researchers, entrepreneurs, [and] engineers working on climate change"" that they have a home in his country.

""I do know how your new president now has decided to jeopardize your budget, your initiatives, and he is extremely skeptical about climate change,"" he said. ""I have no doubt about climate change.""Macron went on to promise robust funding for climate initiatives. In Europe, as a general rule, climate change is less of a political issue, with few major political parties arguing against established science.

Macron's opponent in the second round of the election, the far-right candidate Marinne Le Pen, was a bit of an exception to this rule. Le Pen opposed various environmental initiatives and did not acknowledge outright that humans are the primary cause of climate change.

Macron defeated Le Pen 66% to 34%.

Anonymous donor gives every household in an Iowa town $150 in gift cards for food,Anonymous donor gives every household in an Iowa town $150 in gift cards for food,1.0,"(CNN) Like most of the world, the residents of a small town in Iowa are stuck at home, feeling isolated, alone, and trying their best to stay positive during the coronavirus pandemic.

So when an anonymous donor gave everyone in the town of Earlham $150 worth of gift cards for food, the community received something more valuable than money: hope.

It started on March 26, when Earlham Mayor Jeff Lillie received a call from a friend who told him there was a donor interested in interjecting money into the town's economy. Earlham, population 1,450, is 30 miles west of Des Moines,

At first, the donor, who did not reveal their identity to the mayor, said they would buy 100 gift cards from three local businesses. An hour later, his friend called Lillie again and said the donor was bumping the number up to 250. An hour after that, the number was raised to 500.

""I said to him, at 500, you're darn near giving a gift card to every single household in Earlham,"" Lillie said. ""When I told him there were 549 households in town, he said 'Done.' And that was it. I was ecstatic because it made sure everyone would get a card.""

Bollywood film star Amitabh Bachchan has been hailed as a hero after clearing 40 million rupees (£438,000) worth of loans taken out by almost 1,400 farmers in his home state in northern India.

An ongoing agricultural crisis has seen India's farmers hit hard by a drop in commodity prices, stagnant wages, record fuel prices and high fertiliser costs.

Bachchan, one of Indian cinema's most revered actors, wrote in his blog this week that he had helped 1,398 farmers from the northern state of Uttar Pradesh and felt a 'sense of accomplishment'.

'Gratitude leans across to the desire of removing some of the burdens that farmers continue to suffer... and the inner peace it generates when the desired is completed,' he wrote.

The agricultural crisis has sparked rallies across the country this year calling for better prices for produce and loan waivers.

Farmers and other agriculture workers together make up about half India's 1.3 billion people.

'It is a very big problem that has left farmers across the country in dire straits,' Rakesh Tikait, spokesperson of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Indian Farmers' Union) told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a phone interview.

'The government policies are flawed and need an overhaul. We are fighting for that change but are thankful for any help that comes along the way.'

Tikait said Bachchan's gesture might have been symbolic but it meant a lot for farmers who were struggling to survive.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg released from hospital after gallbladder treatment,US Supreme Court Ruth Bader Ginsburg released from hospital after gallbladder treatment,1.0,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg was released from a Baltimore hospital on Wednesday, the Supreme Court said in a statement. Her release comes just a day after the court said she was treated for acute cholecystitis, which was described as a ""benign gallbladder condition.""

""Justice Ginsburg has been discharged from the hospital. She is doing well and glad to be home,"" the statement said. ""The Justice will return to The John's Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, for follow-up outpatient visits over the next few weeks to eventually remove the gallstone non-surgically.""

In a statement Tuesday, the court said Ginsburg had been suffering from a gallstone that had moved to her cystic duct, blocking the duct and causing an infection.

Despite her hospitalization, Ginsburg still participated in oral arguments via teleconference earlier Wednesday.

The 87-year-old justice has had several health issues over the past few years, including multiple bouts with cancer. Ginsburg was treated for a tumor on her pancreas in August 2019. In December 2018, she had two cancerous nodules removed from her lungs. Ginsburg announced that she was ""cancer-free"" in January.

Missing 13-year-old Jayme Closs found alive in Wisconsin,Missing 13-year-old Jayme Closs found alive in Wisconsin,1.0,"(CNN) Jayme Closs, a 13-year-old girl who vanished after her parents were found dead in their northwestern Wisconsin home, has been found alive, the Barron County Sheriff's Department said.

The Douglas County Sheriff's Department in Wisconsin notified the Barron County Sheriff's Department on Thursday that they had located Jayme alive.

She was found late Thursday afternoon in Gordon, Wisconsin, a town about 66 miles north of where Jayme was last seen, the Douglas County Sheriff's Office said.

A suspect was taken into custody about 10 minutes after authorities found Jayme, the sheriff's office said.

Though authorities didn't immediately release more details, a woman told the Star Tribune in Minneapolis that Jayme approached her for help Thursday afternoon while the woman was walking her dog.

They rushed to a neighbor's home, where someone called 911, the Star Tribune reported.

Authorities have said they will hold a news conference Friday morning.

Jayme's aunt, Sue Allard, said her niece was in the hospital Thursday night.

""There was rumors earlier today, and I prayed and prayed, and they come to not be true,"" Allard told CNN affiliate WCCO reporter Mary McGuire. ""And I just shut myself totally down. I thought today was going to be the day, and then I find out two hours later that she's found and I just cannot believe this.""

Jayme vanished October 15, and her parents, James and Denise Closs, were found fatally shot in their home near Barron, a town of 3,300 people in northwestern Wisconsin.

Investigators say a mysterious 911 call led deputies to discover the bodies. The call was ""pinged"" to the Closs home. When the dispatcher called the number back, a voicemail greeting indicated the phone belonged to Denise Closs. The log does not indicate who made the 911 call, but the dispatcher heard yelling in the background.

Police arrived to find the door kicked in, but no one was there. Investigators said they believed Jayme was at home during the shooting.

""Finally, we want to especially thank the family for their support and patience while this case was ongoing. We promised to bring Jayme home and tonight we get to fulfill that promise. From the bottom of my heart THANK YOU!"" Barron County Sheriff Chris Fitzgerald said in a statement.

""This case has been very trying on the family so please respect their privacy and we reunite them later tonight.""

Thousands of people joined search parties for months as investigators received thousands of tips. The FBI offered a cash reward for information on Jayme's whereabouts, and hunters in the area were urged to be on the lookout for clues.

In December, the Barron County Clerk of Courts Office dedicated its Christmas tree to Jayme. The decorations spelled out her name in big, glittery letters, and they included green bulbs and ribbons. The color green is often used to raise awareness of missing children.

In the days after Jayme's disappearance, law enforcement officials assured the public they believed she was alive and in danger.

Another of Jayme's aunts, Jennifer Smith, pleaded with those who knew where the girl was to contact the sheriff's department.

""Jayme, we need you here with us to fill that hole we have in our hearts,"" Smith said shortly after the girl went missing. ""We all love you to the moon and back. And we will never stop looking for you.""

He transformed a trailer into a free dental clinics,A Kentucky dentist set up a mobile dental clinic so he could drive around offering free dental care to disadvantaged children in Appalachia,1.0,"Barbourville, Kentucky (CNN) When Dr. Edwin Smith was a young dentist beginning his career in eastern Kentucky, he encountered many patients with rampant tooth decay.

""I saw a lot of patients who hadn't seen a dentist before,"" said Smith, a Kentucky native.

Appalachia has one of the worst dental health problems in the nation. And Kentucky has the third highest rate of tooth loss.

Smith treated patients who had tried to pull out their teeth with pliers; others had superglued their teeth back onto their gums. And he saw people who were sick from chronic infection.

But the most heartbreaking stories came from his youngest patients.

""I would see a lot of kids who had a mouth full of rotting teeth,"" Smith said. ""They were in pain, and they'd be hurting at school.""

So in 2005, Smith created a mobile clinic to bring free dental care to children in need.

Dr. Edwin Smith and his staff use a mobile clinic to bring free dental care to students across Kentucky

Since then, his nonprofit, Kids First Dental Services, has treated more than 43,000 children throughout Kentucky.

""(I hope) none of these kids ever have poor oral health and bad teeth as a barrier to keep them from moving up in life and bettering themselves,"" he said.

CNN's Laura Klairmont spoke with Smith about his work. Below is an edited version of their conversation.

CNN: You were born and raised in Appalachia. What makes this region special to you?

Smith: What you see right away is the beauty. I think it's the most beautiful place I've ever been. We have the mountains and trees and lakes. We have lots of talented, resourceful people who live here—real craftsmen and just good, solid people.

The only disadvantage is there's not a lot of economic opportunity with jobs. Poverty is a serious issue. Unfortunately, when we make the news, most of the time it's talking about the poverty and the negative. People from Appalachia feel like they're stereotyped as toothless, barefoot and uneducated.

CNN: Appalachia does have some of the worst dental health problems in the country. Why do you think that is?

Smith: The number one issue is education. When I first started practicing, I would see babies being fed bottles filled with sugary drinks. Also, many people can't afford to get treatment done, and many of these families don't have the transportation that they need to access it.

JUST WATCHED CNN Hero Dr. Edwin Smith: Miles of smiles Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH CNN Hero Dr. Edwin Smith: Miles of smiles 02:04

It's also the history here. People have been poor here in the past, and they didn't have means for taking care of their teeth. People have that fatalistic notion that, ""If my parents lost their teeth early, I'm going to lose mine anyway. So what's the point in getting them fixed?""

People let their teeth go. That's why it is so important to educate the kids. If you teach them early on, they'll take better care of their teeth and won't have these problems later on in life.

CNN: How did your nonprofit work evolve?

Smith: We wanted to help kids access preventative dental care, so we turned a trailer into a mobile dental clinic. At first we went to a couple schools. Then other schools around the county started asking us if we could come to see them. In a couple years, we had school districts all around Kentucky asking us to come and see their students.

We saw so much need that hadn't been met. Now, there are schools we go back to each year, and with every year we see more improvement in the oral health of these kids.

CNN: What services does your mobile dental clinic offer?

Smith: We provide free checkups for kids. We give them dental exams, clean their teeth, do x-rays when needed, apply fluoride, do sealants on any permanent molars that don't have decay in them. And we make a treatment plan of any other needs that they have—the restorative work or extractions they need done—because we don't have the ability to do invasive procedures in the mobile clinic.

The Hill family, patients of Dr. Smith, show off their smiles

That treatment plan is sent home to the parents. I do that follow-up treatment for any of the kids who are able to come to my private practice. But in some cases it's too far away, so we also provide a directory of local dentists in different areas who've agreed to provide follow-up care.

CNN: What does this work mean to you?

Smith: I felt like I had a calling to do this. It was just something that was laid out in front of me that needed to be done, and no one else was doing it. Just seeing that we're still making a difference keeps me going.

When I see kids at schools we've been providing treatment to for 10 years and how much the incidence of tooth decay in the kids there has been reduced, that's motivation enough.

I've had people get up out of their chair, look in the mirror, and cry. People who, before, wouldn't even let you see their teeth, and now they've got these big, wide smiles. That's one of the most rewarding things.

Health care refugees: Medical marijuana and new hope,Medical marijuana saves five year old from seizures,1.0,"This is the second part of a series on health care refugees. Read the first part here .

(CNN) Rich and Kim Muszynski know when their 5-year-old daughter, Abby, is about to have a grand mal seizure because her pupils enlarge, and she'll seem to fixate at something in the distance that only she can see.

Then it starts. Abby's extremities shake. She gasps for air.

By the time she turned 3, Abby had tried about eight different anti-seizure medications. None of them worked very well. Panicked to see their daughter getting worse and worse, the Muszynskis drove three hours to Orlando to see Dr. Ngoc Minh Le, a board certified pediatric neurologist and epileptologist.

Le told them that chances of another anti-seizure drug working on Abby were tiny. He recommended medical marijuana. The timing was right: Just months before, Gov. Rick Scott had legalized the use of a type of non-euphoric cannabis called Charlotte's Web.

The formulation had been a miracle for a little girl with epilepsy named Charlotte Figi. The Muszynskis had seen her story on Dr. Sanjay Gupta's CNN documentary "" Weed .""

Charlotte's Web did help Abby, but not as much as it had helped Charlotte. She still was having about two grand mal seizures a week, each lasting about eight to 10 minutes.

Le explained to Kim and Rich that Charlotte's Web has only tiny amounts of THC, one of the psychoactive ingredients in marijuana. Medical marijuana with higher levels of THC was Abby's best hope, he told them.

But at this point, in 2015, high-THC marijuana wasn't legal in Florida for Abby. To get it, the Muszynskis would have to move, leaving behind their friends and family, including two older children.

Kim thought about Colorado, where Charlotte Figi lived. She'd checked with parents of disabled children there, and they told her the state had a fair and efficient Medicaid program.

Getting to Colorado would be a challenge: Abby's doctors said it wasn't safe for her to fly on a commercial plane or to take a long car ride across the country.

The Muszynskis began their final fight with Florida Medicaid -- one that would leave Kim and Abby homeless for several days.

Kim says that in mid-August, she started talking to Medicaid officials about getting an air ambulance to Colorado. On September 19, Rich drove the family car out to Colorado. They planned for Kim to attend the closing on their house in Boynton Beach on September 23 and leave on the air ambulance with Abby that afternoon.

Kim had emailed and spoken with various Florida officials, and it seemed to her that everything was in order. ""Please give a call today so we can finalize travel arrangements!"" Mary Joyce, a senior registered nurse supervisor at Children's Medical Services at the Florida Department of Health, wrote in an email to Kim on September 20.

But then several days passed, and there was still no final approval for the transport.

Their house sold, Kim and Abby were homeless. They moved in with Kim's best friend and her husband. All of Abby's equipment, like her bed with guardrails, was with Rich on their way to Colorado. Kim slept with Abby on the floor.

Abby's cries at night kept Kim's friends awake. Kim wrote emails begging Florida officials for help. But for the first time, she added someone not previously included on the email: this CNN reporter.

Three days later, she learned that the transport had been approved.

A spokeswoman for Florida's Agency for Health Care Administration gave this statement:

""In this case relocation services are not covered by Medicaid, per federal Medicaid guidelines. However, thanks to Safety Net funds made available by Governor Scott and the Legislature, the state supported this family by covering the costs to provide relocation services via the air ambulance of the mother's choice. Working with the family, the state arranged transport as quickly as possible,"" wrote the spokeswoman, Mallory McManus.

Paramedics transport Abby Muszynski to the air ambulance that will fly her from Florida to Colorado.

On September 28, an ambulance picked up mother and daughter and brought them to Boca Raton Airport. Abby's grandmother and aunt said a prayer over Abby's stretcher as it was loaded on the plane.

As they prepared to leave, Kim said she felt like a refugee in her own country.

""I feel like I'm being forced out of my home,"" she said.

But when Kim and Abby arrived in Colorado Springs, Rich was there to welcome them to their new home.

'The most incredible thing I've ever seen'

Within a few weeks of arriving in Colorado, the Muszynskis felt like they'd been visited by not one but two miracles.

First, the high-THC marijuana has almost completely eradicated Abby's grand mal seizures. When they left Florida, she was having about two to four a week, each lasting about 8 to 12 minutes. In Colorado, she's had about one a week, and they last only a few seconds: Just a drop of high-THC marijuana oil under her tongue stops the seizures almost immediately.

""It's the most incredible thing I've ever seen,"" Kim said.

She hasn't had to go to the hospital for seizures in Colorado at all.

Abby Muszynski takes high-THC medical marijuana for the first time in Colorado.

The second miracle is that so far, Colorado Medicaid has paid for all of Abby's prescriptions and doctors' visits without a problem, a far cry from their experience in Florida. All the hours Kim spent fighting Medicaid can now be spent with her daughter.

Now that Abby is essentially free of grand mal seizures, she's made strides. She can grasp a fork. She can pick up a block and move it. These are small steps for a typical child but huge for Abby.

And more and more, her parents see her personality come out. She smiles and giggles more than she used to, at a balloon floating in the room or when her parents blow bubbles.

Kim and Rich wonder if maybe -- just maybe -- Abby will one day be able to learn some very rudimentary sign language to express what she wants. Maybe she'll be able to take a step with a walker and lots of support.

Despite Abby's improved health, it's been tough on the Muszynskis to be in Colorado. Two weeks after they moved, their elder daughter, Christina, FaceTimed Kim and Rich from Florida to show off her new driver's license.

Abby Muszynski and her older sister, Christina.

Kim rejoiced with her daughter, but she later broke down in tears, knowing that she'd missed this important milestone. She knows she'll miss other big days, like cooking Thanksgiving dinner with her daughter and shopping for a prom dress, and prom itself.

And recently Christina, who's living with her biological father, has been having dizzy spells and fainting. It pains Kim that she's not there to help her.

On November 8, six weeks after the Muszynskis moved to Colorado, Florida voters approved a ballot initiative giving more patients like Abby access to cannabis with higher THC levels.

And about two months before Kim and Rich left Florida, Medicaid started to give them enough doses of Diastat, the expensive anti-seizure medication they'd had to fight for.

Even so, the Muszynskis said they still would have made the choice to leave Florida.

The Medicaid system there was just too unreliable, they said. They never knew when it would stop paying for Abby's medicines or her equipment or her respiratory therapist or if it would kick her off the program altogether, as it did three times in less than three years.

""Florida was unable to meet the needs of our medically fragile child,"" Kim said. ""It ultimately could have resulted in her death.""

Kim Muszynski says Abby's improvement is ""the most incredible thing I've ever seen.""

Abby's not alone

There's a saying among Medicaid experts: When you've seen one Medicaid program, you've seen one Medicaid program.

That's because although there are federal standards, states have a great deal of leeway about how they manage their programs.

Nearly four out of 10 children in the United States are on Medicaid, and care in one state can look very different than care in another.

Though there are no official rankings of state Medicaid systems, experts say there are data that can help gauge quality.

For example, some state Medicaid programs pay doctors relatively low amounts, which means doctors are more likely to stop accepting patients on Medicaid.

Florida ranks the fifth lowest in the country in Medicaid payments, paying 13% lower than the national average, according to an analysis by the Urban Institute of payments made in 2014.

McManus, the spokeswoman for Florida's Agency for Health Care Administration, noted that the Urban Institute numbers are based on fee-for-service physician rates, but the state's Medicaid program predominantly operates managed care plans. The state says it has transitioned to the managed care system over the past few years.

""These rates do not reflect how the majority of Medicaid providers are paid,"" she wrote.

Stephen Zuckerman, the lead author of the Urban Institute report, said there's not much difference between the amounts paid by fee-for-service and managed care, pointing to a report by the US Government Accountability Office (PDF), a nonpartisan agency that works for Congress, that shows only a 5% difference.

Critics of Florida's Medicaid program also point to a report (PDF) this year by a group led by Joan Alker, executive director of the Center for Children and Families at Georgetown University, who's studied Florida Medicaid for more than a decade.

The small survey of pediatricians concluded that ""challenges exist for children enrolling in and accessing care through Florida's managed care system"" and that ""barriers to getting their patients the prescription and over-the-counter medications they needed were also a serious concern for pediatricians.""

In a letter to the Sarasota Herald-Tribune , Dudek, then the secretary of the state Agency for Health Care Administration, said the Georgetown report was biased, noting that the response rate was less than 1% of physicians participating in Medicaid.

Overall, advocates for families on Medicaid say Florida isn't the only state where doctors and parents have expressed dissatisfaction, noting that families have fled other states, not just Florida, in search of better Medicaid services.

""This isn't unique to Florida, but Florida certainly has serious problems,"" Alker said.

She said her heart breaks for the parents who must provide around-the-clock care to severely disabled children.

""These families already face incredible struggles,"" she said. ""These families are my heroes.

""They don't need the state of Florida making it harder for them,"" she added. ""The state of Florida should be making it easier.""",http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/28/health/health-care-refugees-part-2/index.html
Iranian fans unfurl banner at World Cup demanding home country allow women to sporting events,Iranian fans unfurl banner at World Cup demanding home country allow women to sporting events,1.0,"Iranian soccer fans made a political gesture at the country’s opening World Cup match against Morocco on Friday by unfurling a banner protesting a ban on women attending soccer matches back home.

“#NoBan4Women” and “Support Iranian Women to Attend Stadium” were seen on banners in the St. Petersburg Stadium.

The banner was unfurled in the first half of the match, but after a brief commotion it was put away. However, the banner was re-unfurled later in the first half.

Iranian women have been banned from attending male-only sporting events since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Tehran gave a small exception in 2015, allowing some women to watch a volleyball game.

The decision came after British-Iranian student Ghoncheh Ghavami was detained while trying to attend a men's volleyball match at Azadi. She spent more than 100 days in prison, much of it in solitary confinement.

Iran beat Morocco 1-0 after an own goal by Aziz Bouhaddouz in injury stoppage time.

"Woman Carries Twins for Her Sister, Who Had 9 Miscarriages","Woman Carries Twins for Her Sister, Who Had 9 Miscarriages",1.0,"Melissa Kayser had lost hope of becoming a mom after having nine miscarriages – until her older sister stepped in.

Kayser, 33, had been trying to have a baby for three years when doctors finally suggested, after fertility treatments and IVF, that she should consider a surrogate.

“I was devastated because you think as women we are literally born to do one thing and that’s to reproduce and when you can’t do that one thing you feel like a failure,” Kayser told InsideEdition.com. “I didn’t know if I could emotionally handle another woman being able to carry my child.”

That's when Kayser’s sister, 35-year-old Lisa Auten, offered to carry a baby for her.

“I couldn't stand watching Melissa go through loss after loss,"" Auten told InsideEdition.com. ""She hurt so badly and she just wanted a child so bad. If I could help give her a family, then I was going to do it.""

Doctors recommended that the sister have two embryos implanted. No one was expecting both to take, however, because doctors said one of the embryos was poor quality.

But then came the news: It was twins.

“I think we were all a little bit shocked. My sister was telling them to count again,” Kayser said. “My sister had a really good pregnancy and very little complications. I got to be at all the ultrasounds and got to feel the babies kick. We did a gender reveal and we tried to make things fun and memorable.”

The baby girls, Tierney and Ashlynn, are now 6 weeks old.

The sisters, however, are still going through the process of getting Kayser listed as their official mom due to Nebraska law. Although the twins are biologically Kayser’s, Auten was listed on the birth certificate and Auten has to relinquish her parental rights to allow Kayser to ‘adopt’ her children.

The adoption will take place when the girls reach 6 months old.

Auten said she still doesn’t want to have kids of her own although pregnancy was a fun experience for her.

“I never saw myself being a mom. I enjoyed being pregnant, but the experience has not changed my mind,"" Auten said. ""I am just fine being an aunt.""

And Kayser is extremely grateful for the gifts her big sister has given her.

“Every day I am in awe. You hear women say you don’t really know love until you have children. They really do complete me,” Kayser said. “There’s never any words that I can say to thank her for what she did. She gave up a year of her life so that we could have a family. I could never repay.”

A female soldier became the US Army's first female Green Beret on Thursday.

The National Guard soldier graduated, earned her Special Forces Tab, and earned her Green Beret Thursday at a ceremony at Fort Bragg, North Carolina celebrating her and her classmates completion of Special Forces training.

US Army Special Operations Command is withholding identifying information about the woman due to mission security demands for special operations troops.

In a major achievement for women in the armed forces, a soldier became the US Army's first female Green Beret Thursday, US Army Special Operations Command announced.

The female National Guard soldier, whose name is being withheld due to mission security concerns for special operations troops, graduated from Army Special Forces training, received her Special Forces Tab, and donned her Green Beret at a socially distanced ceremony at Fort Bragg in North Carolina.

Commanding General for US Army Special Operations Command Lt. Gen. Fran Beaudette told the graduating class Thursday that ""from here, you will go forward and join the storied formation of the Green Berets where you will do what you are trained to do: challenge assumptions, break down barriers, smash through stereotypes, innovate, and achieve the impossible.""Â

""Thankfully,"" the general said, ""after today, our Green Beret Men and Women will forever stand in the hearts of free people everywhere.""

The soldier, a Special Forces engineer sergeant, first completed an initial 24-day screening program before heading into the yearlong Special Forces Qualification Course (Q Course), The New York Times, which first reported her graduation, reported Thursday.

She completed the final assessment, the culminating Robin Sage exercise that tests soldiers on skills essential to being a Green Beret, in mid-June.

Story continues

The Pentagon opened all combat positions in the armed forces to women in late 2015.

""They'll be allowed to drive tanks, fire mortars and lead infantry soldiers into combat,"" Defense Secretary Ash Carter said at the time. ""They'll be able to serve as Army Rangers and Green Berets, Navy SEALs, Marine Corps infantry, Air Force parajumpers, and everything else that was previously open only to men.""

Since then, women have begun to fill previously restricted roles, the exception being the Special Forces. These elite troops wage unconventional warfare, and their training is especially demanding. Special Forces has been one of the few remaining all-male warfighting communities.

While the woman that graduated Thursday is the first to become a Green Beret, she is not the first woman to graduate from the training program.

In the early 1980s, a woman named Capt. Kate Wilder completed Special Forces training, but she was forced out at the last minute. The Army later sent her a graduation certificate after an investigation upheld her discrimination complaint and determined that she was wrongfully denied graduation.

But Wilder, who left the Army as a lieutenant colonel in 2003, never joined the Green Berets.

""It isn't important that I wear the hat,"" she told the AP after graduating. ""I'm not at all hung up on a hat like a lot of the men are ... What matters is that I'm officially qualified.""

A senior Army official previously told Military.com that the woman who graduated Thursday ""excelled throughout the course and earned the respect of both her instructors and her peer group.""

Uttar Pradesh officials distributed 50 million tree saplings across the state to help India increase its forest cover and to break the Guinness World record for the number of trees planted in 24 hours—which was set by Pakistan in 2013 with 847,275 trees—the AP reported. Students, lawmakers, government officials and others headed out to plant trees at designated spots along roads, rail tracks and in forested lands.

Uttar Pradesh's Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, told the AP that this record-breaking attempt would help spread awareness and enthusiasm about afforestation and conservation.

""The world has realized that serious efforts are needed to reduce carbon emissions to mitigate the effects of global climate change. Uttar Pradesh has made a beginning in this regard,"" he said.



The Indian government is encouraging all states to start tree-planting drives like the one in Uttar Pradesh. The government has designated more than $6.2 billion for this purpose alone. India pledged to push its forest cover to 235 million acres by 2030.

Sites where the saplings have been planted with be monitored through aerial photographs, Sanjeev Saran, senior forest official, told the AP. Normally, only 60 percent of saplings survive so it is important for the government to check how many are thriving or dying.

Auditors from Guinness World Records, working ""incognito"" according to Saran, are checking on the numbers of saplings planted.

""They are out in the field and are supervising the plantation drive,"" he said. ""We do not know who they are or where they are at this point in time.""",http://www.ecowatch.com/plant-50-million-trees-guinness-world-record-1917368877.html
Dutch ban on free plastic bags sees 71 pct drop in use,Holland has reduced the amount of plastic bags used by more than 70% since a 2016 law that banned all retailers and restaurants from giving them for free.,1.0,"The use of plastic bags dropped 71 percent since the Dutch government banned shops from giving them out for free in 2016, according to a report commissioned by the Ministry of Infrastructure and Environment on the results of the ban. Some 300 retailers were questioned about their experience with the free plastic bag ban, NU.nl reports.

Bakers and butchers estimated that about six out of 10 customers now bring their own bag. Department stores estimate about 40 percent. The ban on free plastic bags was introduced in the fight against litter. According to a study by Dutch public works department Rijkswaterstaat, the number of plastic bags that end up as litter decreased by 40 percent.

A total of 30 percent of retailers now offer paper bags, as an alternative to the plastic bag. In most cases the paper bag is offered for free. And while some retailers doubt whether paper bags are really more environmentally friendly, the ban on plastic did mean a 30 percent increase in sales for paper bag wholesalers.

Most retailers support the free plastic bag ban and only a small percentage still insist on giving plastic bags away with purchases. About 3 percent of market vendors and 5 percent of department stores still give bags away. All butchers, bakers and greengrocers adhere to the ban.

Market vendors charge an average of 6.9 cents per plastic bags. Department stores and small businesses charge around 10 cents per bag. In exceptional cases a plastic bag can cost up to 29 cents.",https://nltimes.nl/2017/04/18/dutch-ban-free-plastic-bags-sees-71-pct-drop-use
Easton toddler denied $2.1m gene therapy will now get it for free,Easton toddler denied $2.1m gene therapy will now get it for free,1.0,"“I was shocked, but I’m excited and I’m very grateful,” her mother, Marisa Boidi, said Monday of AveXis’s reversal, which followed a Globe story on Thursday concerning the denial of her application. “It’s going to give her a better chance at life.”

Illinois-based AveXis, a subsidiary of the Swiss drug giant Novartis, has agreed to provide Zolgensma, an intravenous gene therapy that requires only one dose, free to Natalia Boidi through a compassionate use program. She has spinal muscular atrophy, which kills more infants than any other inherited disorder.

A 2½-year-old Easton girl who was deemed ineligible for the world’s most expensive drug will get the $2.1 million medicine to treat her rare genetic disease, after all.

Afflicting one in every 6,000 to 10,000 babies, spinal muscular atrophy, or SMA, attacks the neurons that control muscle function. Its most dire form kills most children by their second birthday.

Natalia can’t swallow liquids, has a feeding tube inserted into her abdomen, uses a breathing machine at night, and often needs her parents to clear mucus from her airways with a suction device. During a reporter’s recent visit to her house, she watched TV with an oxygen monitor tethered to the big toe on her right foot.

Before the drug won Food and Drug Administration approval on May 24, AveXis had been providing it free to some patients under its compassionate use protocol. But the program was limited to children with Type 1 SMA, the worst form of the disease. Based on Natalia’s medical records, the Novartis subsidiary concluded that she had Type 2, a milder form, and denied her application.

But after receiving more documentation from Natalia’s neurologist at Massachusetts General Hospital after the Globe story was published, AveXis concluded the toddler did indeed have the worst form and was entitled to receive Zolgensma as an experimental drug.

“We are pleased that we are able to treat this child” under the program that AveXis set up with the FDA “now that we have received the proper documentation,” a company spokeswoman said in an e-mail to the Globe.

Although the compassionate use program ended the day the FDA approved Zolgensma, Natalia and several other patients were already in a queue to receive it if deemed eligible, AveXis said.

Natalia is expected to get the medicine later this month, according to the staff of her neurologist, Dr. Kathryn Swoboda.

The FDA approved Zolgensma for all forms of the disease, but only for children up to the age of 2. The compassionate use program made the drug available free to Type 1 patients older than 2 if they weighed less than 29 pounds and met other criteria. Natalia weighs 26 pounds.

Swoboda said she believes the turn of events illustrates that the way the medical world classifies the four forms of spinal muscular atrophy may need to change.

There was never any doubt in her mind that Natalia had the worst form, Swoboda said. Natalia began gasping for air in 2017, when she was about five weeks old, and had a breathing tube temporarily inserted into her throat. She spent more than two months in the pediatric intensive care unit at Mass. General.

But since late 2017, Natalia has received 10 injections of an earlier breakthrough drug, Spinraza, sold by the Cambridge biotech Biogen. Approved the year before, Spinraza was the first treatment for spinal muscular atrophy. It’s injected into the spinal canal and helps make more of a protein that controls muscle movement.

That drug doesn’t come cheap, either: It’s $125,000 for each 5-milliliter dose. Patients need six doses the first year, at a cost of $750,000, and three doses every year afterward, at an annual expense of $375,000.

Spinraza saved Natalia’s life, Swoboda said. But the girl’s survival and ability to sit briefly now, the neurologist said, evidently led AveXis officials to incorrectly believe she had the less severe form of the disease and didn’t need Zolgensma.

“I think it’s the right decision,” she said of AveXis’s change of heart. “I personally believe she will have a significant added benefit from the gene therapy. Spinraza has helped her tremendously. But she has a lot of ongoing medical issues.”

In clinical trials, Zolgensma helped infants and young children breathe on their own and achieve motor milestones, like sitting up without support.

AveXis hardly wants more controversy about Zolgensma. Last Tuesday, the FDA disclosed that the company had delayed disclosing to the government that one or more people at the subsidiary had manipulated animal testing data for the gene therapy, although the agency said the drug should remain on the market.

A group of senators, including presidential hopefuls Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, subsequently blasted Novartis in a letter to the FDA. The data manipulation, they wrote, “smacks of the pharmaceutical industry’s privilege and greed.”

The FDA has said it’s considering whether to bring civil or criminal penalties against Novartis and its subsidiary.

Ten Tons of Trash Removed from Mount Everest,Ten Tons of Trash Removed from Mount Everest,1.0,"“Waste is a taboo in our society, considered as dirt,” mused Ujen Wangmo Lepcha of Moware Designs, which upcycles rubbish into light fixtures and glasses.

“When they see these kind of products they are like ‘wow’, these things can be made and it is possible,” she explained.

Their products are now used in upmarket hotels, restaurants, and homes around the capital, and Lepcha says there is growing consumer interest in goods made from salvaged Everest scraps.

Aanchal Malla of Hotel Yak & Yeti, a luxury five-star hotel in Kathmandu, said opting for the upcycled goods was in-line with the hotel’s move towards sustainable and environmentally friendly products.

“It is not just better for us and the environment but then it goes way bigger than that… it is encouragement of everyone who is trying to move into that direction of making the globe into a better place, reducing all the waste,” Malla said.

A new waste facility — called Sagarmatha Next after the Nepali name for Everest — is also being completed in Syangboche at an altitude of nearly 3,800 metres (12,400 feet), passed by trekkers and mountaineers on the way to the base camp.

Dubai: Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan launched the Spring 2019 tree plantation drive as part of the 10 billion tree tsunami today.

Khan had announced the 10 billion tree tsunami last year, soon after he took office, and today he tweeted about the inauguration.

@ImranKhanPTI: We are launching our #Plant4Pakistan programme and reclaiming mafia encroached land, converting it into forests and wildlife parks for our future generations to fight climate change and pollution.

The tree planting drive is part of the ‘Prime Minister’s special initiatives’. The poster shared by Khan provided details of the inauguration today at Nankana Sahib, near the city of Lahore, with the message: “Earlier, forests would be captured (by the land mafia). Now the land will be reclaimed and used to grow forests again.”

The day will be marked across the country with several Pakistanis participating in the drive. On social media, people shared the message encouraging others to participate and #Plant4Pakistan became a trend across the country.

In a television interview to Pakistan’s Hum News, the Minister of Climate Change Malik Amin Aslam said that it was the Prime Minister’s vision to reclaim the land that had been taken over by the land mafia.

Most appreciated the initiative by the Prime Minister and highlighted the importance of the drive in the long run. Tweep @QiaserAfridi wrote: “No one till now had paid attention towards this issue in history … trees also combat climate change and buffer the impacts of storms and floods. Hope this initiative and awareness will motivate people towards the healthy environment.”

Even in neighbouring India, tweeps could not help but share their thoughts. Tweep @AroraGirish wrote: “The problem of land mafia seems international, thanks for your concern for environment.”

However, some users felt like Khan’s time in power had not shown concrete results on the ground. Tweep @Mahar8baloch wrote: “Time is short but subjects [of concern] are more and more. So make the best use of your time. Imran Khan should get the trust of the nation that believes on you. Your progress in missing in front of the nation.”

About the drive

Khan has been an advocate of environmental conservation for quite a long time. When his party - Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) – was in power in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, his government planted one billion trees in two years.

Earlier this month, Pakistan’s Ministry of Climate Change signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the National Rural Support Programme (NRSP) to use drone technology to plant millions of trees.",https://gulfnews.com/world/asia/pakistan/pakistan-aims-to-reclaim-land-from-mafia-turn-it-into-forests-with-10-billion-trees-1.61964596

A little girl in New York with burns over 75 percent of her body has only one wish for Christmas this year — enough cards to fill her aunt’s card tree.

Two years ago, Safyre Terry’s father and three younger siblings were killed in a fire caused by arson. She was found next to her father, who used his body to shield her from the flames.

In addition to suffering from severe burns, Safyre lost her right hand three months after the fire, and lost her left foot in March. She’s had dozens of surgeries and her next one is Jan. 5, Safyre’s paternal aunt Liz Dodler told BuzzFeed. Dodler has sole custody of Safyre.

Dodler told Buzzfeed she bought a tree to hang Christmas cards on this year, and Safyre instantly got excited, “I can’t wait to fill it up” my response was ‘Hunny, that’s probably not gonna happen. We maybe get 10 cards a year, and the card tree holds 100,’” she said.

So Dodler decided to do something. She posted a request for cards on Facebook, and it took off on social media. The cards have already started coming in.

Christmas cards for Safyre can be sent to:

Personal loss prompts Lenexa couple to brew beer for suicide prevention,"Lenexa, KS couple to brew beer for suicide prevention. A limited-edition beer called ""Your Story Is Not Complete"" will have the Johnson County 24-hour crisis hotline number on the back of the can. The beer is available until supplies run out, with 100% of the proceeds going to suicide prevention.",1.0,"LENEXA, Kan. — September is National Suicide Prevention Awareness Month. If you or someone you know is having suicidal thoughts, there is help available.

It's a message that's being shared in perhaps an unlikely place: a Lenexa brewery. The couple who runs the brewery says their efforts were born from a very personal loss.

Two years ago, Dave Mobley gave up his career with the U.S. Postal Service to follow his passion — brewing beer.

His brewery, Limitless Brewing, took off. And it wasn't long before his wife quit her job to help him full-time, especially when the pandemic hit and to-go orders went through the roof.

Provided Dave Mobley and his wife, Emily, run Limitless Brewing in Lenexa.

""The amount of cans we had to produce a day, we were shocked,"" Mobley said. ""We were basically getting cans, filling them, 16 hours a day. Then we'd put them out on a Saturday and it would be gone in a couple hours.""

It's been a good problem to have and a reason to celebrate.

Sadly, it's a success story his younger brother and best friend never got to see for himself.

""So, 10 days before we opened Limitless, my brother committed suicide,"" Mobley said, tears filling his eyes.

His family said it was completely out of character, an act they never saw coming.

Provided Dave and Josh Mobley. Dave says his brother’s suicide was an act the family never saw coming.

It happened one day after Josh Mobley's 35th birthday, along Frisbie Road by the Kansas River. A police report determined Josh fatally shot a female friend before turning the gun on himself. Although it was officially declared a murder-suicide, his family maintains two notes were found, indicating it was a suicide pact.

""I think in their minds a lot of them think it's going to help, like even the suicide notes? There's zero closure,"" Dave Mobley said.

""If you've never been through this kind of loss, there's just no answers, and that's the hardest part, you're left with this emptiness and you have no closure to it,"" added Dave's wife, Emily Mobley.

Still, instead of bottling up that pain, they're sharing their story in the hopes of helping others.

The past two years, they've raised money for Johnson County's Suicide Prevention Coalition, including $5,000 last year. The money helps to fund promotional material, including magnets and coasters with suicide hotlines printed on them that are used at local restaurants and bars.

""So, if someone comes in, they might be trying a beverage and they see this coaster,"" said Megan Clark with the Johnson County Mental Health Center. ""They might not need this coaster now or right at that point. We've had some people take pictures so later on they can always go back to this kind of resource.""

Provided Limitless Brewing in Lenexa is raising money for Johnson County's Suicide Prevention Coalition. The money helps to fund promotional material, including magnets and coasters with suicide hotlines printed on them that are used at local restaurants and bars.

But this year, the Mobleys are taking it a step further, brewing a limited-edition beer called ""Your Story Is Not Complete."" On the back, the Johnson County 24-hour crisis hotline number will be listed. The beer is available all month, or until supplies run out, with 100% of the proceeds going to suicide prevention.

Provided For National Suicide Prevention Awareness Month., a Lenexa brewery is brewing a limited-edition beer called “Your Story Is Not Complete.” On the back, it will list the Johnson County 24-hour crisis hotline number.

That money will go toward youth suicide prevention as part of the program Sources of Strength.

""Sources of Strength is a program that aims to prevent suicide by harnessing our strengths we all have as humans. When we talk about prevention, we want to start early,"" Clark said.

Sources of Strength is used in three school districts in Johnson County and some private schools. It's for middle and high school students, but the center also is looking at introducing some curriculum for elementary students.

For the Mobleys, it's important work that they hope teaches kids and teens at an early age that it's okay to not be okay, and it's okay to ask for help. It's a lesson they hope will someday save someone's life.

""You know, everyone has ups and downs in life. We all have our own scars,"" Dave Mobley said. ""It's fine to speak about it. And unfortunately, sometimes pride and other things like that get in people's way. And they don't realize that, how much they matter.""

""Your Story Is Not Complete"" beer can be bought at Limitless Brewing in Lenexa. For more information, head to the brewery's Facebook page or website.

Arizona DPS trooper drags man from car seconds before train hits it,Arizona DPS trooper drags man from car seconds before train hits it,1.0,"PHOENIX — An Arizona Department of Public Safety trooper likely saved a man’s life when he dragged the unresponsive driver out of a car that was hit by a train seconds later.

In a release, the agency said trooper Henry (Hank) Roanhorse was driving home when he spotted the car on some railroad tracks in McKinley County, New Mexico, which is just across the state line.

“Roanhorse was familiar with the area and knew that the tracks carried a large volume of rail traffic, often traveling at high speeds,” the release said.

Roanhorse approached the vehicle and found the 56-year-old driver, Sampson Whitegoat, unconscious behind the wheel. Whitegoat smelled strongly of alcohol.

Roanhorse crawled into the vehicle to take off Whitegoat’s seat belt as a train rounded a nearby curve.

He was able to pull Whitegoat from the vehicle — despite Whitegoat, who had regained consciousness, fighting against him — and dragged his 300-pound frame about 25 feet from the tracks.

Seconds later, the train collided with the car and threw it 150 feet.

“Thank you officer, you just saved my life,” Whitegoat said to Roanhorse after the crash.

Filipino villagers swap trash for rice in fight against plastics,"A village in the Philippines is trying to tackle plastic waste by offering rice to residents in exchange for their trash. Residents can get 1 kg of rice, the staple food for Filipinos, for every 2 kg of plastic waste, which are handed over to the government for proper disposal or recycling.",1.0,"MANILA (Reuters) - A village in the Philippines is trying to tackle the scourge of plastic waste by offering rice to residents in exchange for their trash.

Residents of Bayanan outside the capital, Manila, can get one kg (2.2 lb) of rice, the staple food for Filipinos, for every two kg of plastic waste, which are handed over to the government for proper disposal or recycling.

The Southeast Asian nation is among the world’s top marine plastic polluters, studies show, with laws on solid waste poorly enforced and no regulations on packaging manufacturing.

“I weighed in at 14 kilos of residuals, so I got 7 kilos of rice grains. This is a big help for us to have one kilo of rice for the day,” Veronica Dolorico, a 49-year-old supporter of the program, told Reuters.

“I feel that our surroundings are really dirty. If only I could, I would pick up all the plastics along the road when I walk outside,” she added.

One kg of rice costs about 30-40 pesos ($0.70), which is costly in a country with a fast-growing economy, but high rates of urban and rural poverty.

One-fifth of the population of 107 million people live below the national poverty line, with monthly consumption of less than $241 per person.

Bayanan collected more than 213 kg of sachets, bottles and plastic bags in August, said village chief Andor San Pedro, adding the food-for-trash swap is teaching people how to properly dispose of their waste.",https://www.reuters.com/article/us-asia-waste-philippines-rice/filipino-villagers-swap-trash-for-rice-in-fight-against-plastics-idUSKCN1VX2M5
"Meals On Wheels Serves Up Breakfast, Lunch And Community At Local Diner","One project in Washington took a new approach to Meals on Wheels: a diner — where seniors can get eggs, coffee, and community. ""They play Frank Sinatra in the mornings, and it makes me so happy,"" a patron says. ""Eggs and Frank Sinatra: perfect breakfast.""",1.0,"Meals On Wheels Serves Up Breakfast, Lunch And Community At Local Diner

Usually Meals on Wheels means home delivery or lunch at a senior center. For more than 50 years, the federal government has been funding the program to make sure older Americans get the nutrition they need. Now, a project in Vancouver, Wash., is trying to use those funds for something new: a retro-hip diner, where seniors can get eggs, coffee, and community.

On the surface, The Diner looks like any other diner. Servers making sure the coffee is topped off, local business people having meetings, regulars who know the whole menu. There are the usual diner specialties, with some modern nods — cage-free eggs and local produce — and a retro vibe.

""They play Frank Sinatra in the mornings, and it makes me so happy,"" says Autumn Zukauskus, who comes for breakfast weekly. ""Eggs and Frank Sinatra: perfect breakfast.""

But when a younger patron like Zukauskus reaches for her credit card, seniors like Chris Bingenheimer pull out a little green dining card.

""If you can donate, you do. If you don't, you don't,"" Bingenheimer explains. ""And it's no big deal to them.""

That's because the entire diner is a project of the local organization Meals on Wheels People. If you look closer, you'll notice a few differences from other restaurants. The chairs are on casters, to scoot out easily if they need to make space for a wheelchair. The coffee cups have large handles, to accommodate arthritic fingers. The building and finishes were designed and selected to minimize noise and maximize comfort.

Avoiding stigma

Suzanne Washington is the CEO of Meals on Wheels People, which serves about 5,000 meals a day. Most of these are home delivery, and about a third are in senior centers. But people don't always want to go to a senior center.

""We heard lots of folks say it was just too much of a stigma to go,"" Washington says.

Some baby boomers think senior centers are just for their grandparents. Or they're still working, and can't get away for lunch. So, Washington thought, 'Why not try a restaurant?'

""A restaurant that is inter-generational. It's good food,"" says Washington. ""And at the same time, the paying public can help offset the cost of those in our program.""

There's a slightly different menu for participating seniors — like an added fruit cup or a glass of milk — to meet nutritional requirements. And some regular menu items aren't part of the program.

""Because we can never make eggs benedict meet regulations,"" Washington says. ""It just doesn't work.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Meals on Wheels Meals on Wheels

But the menu is still delicious, and the diner's been averaging 140 subsidized meals each month. They've signed up an average of 38 new members per month — about three times the number that sign up for Meals on Wheels at their traditional senior centers. And those who come for the meal donate more for it — the average donation is $2.46, which is four times higher than the donation at a senior center. And for an organization that provides 1.2 million senior meals annually, every increase is significant.

New sign-ups also get a visit from a client service coordinator, who does assessments, and checks if seniors need to be connected to additional services — the sort of information that they might have found at a traditional senior center.

The decline in participation at traditional senior centers isn't just a problem in the Pacific Northwest.

""It is a national trend, where many senior centers are witnessing declining participation rates,"" explains Manoj Pardasani, a provost and professor of social work at Hunter College.

Providing engagement

Pardasani says the decline is due to a number of factors: centers that haven't innovated to reflect the diversity of the population, or people who look down on senior centers as something only for ""needy"" people. And he says the downturn is concerning, because these centers provide far more than just food. They provide community engagement, and combat isolation, which provides a benefit for mental and emotional health.

""The core belief behind meals is the socialization aspect,"" says Pardasani. ""We're human beings, we've been socialized to be social animals.""

And The Diner is a social place. You can see it in the customers joking with the staff, the people who bring in an older neighbors, the seniors who carpool together for a meal.

Young people like Amber Zukauskus come for that camaraderie just as much as for the little pies.

""Everyone here is so nice,"" says Zukauskus. ""And they pay everybody a living wage, and so all your tips just go to donations for Meals on Wheels, which is amazing. That's something I want to give money to.""

The Diner has gone through the usual hiccups of starting a new restaurant — dealing with staffing, figuring out the lunch rush, adjusting portion size so that seniors might have some extra to take home and eat later. Meals on Wheels People received some grant money to help with start up costs, and they expect to turn a profit in their third year. But even early on, they seem to be hitting their stride. It's a bustling, thriving business.

Chris Bingenheimer learned about The Diner from a friend, and came in to share a meal. He sometimes goes to a senior center, but was never a fan of the made-in-advance food, or the minimal choices, or of the fact he had to be called up for a meal like at the high school cafeteria. He said he'll definitely be back to The Diner.

""The staff is very friendly,"" says Bingenheimer. ""They don't look down on you because you're with the Meals on Wheels program. They treat you kindly. The service is impeccable.""

Bingenheimer is a senior using Meals on Wheels. And at The Diner, he's also just a guy, sitting with a friend, having a good breakfast.",https://www.npr.org/2020/01/18/796721306/meals-on-wheels-serves-up-breakfast-lunch-and-community-at-local-diner?utm_campaign=npr&utm_medium=social&utm_term=nprnews&utm_source=twitter.com
'The audience was spellbound': World-renowned violinist performs at maximum-security prison,World Class Musician Finds Appreciative Audience At Maximum Security Prison,1.0,"Over his 50-year career, classical violinist Gidon Kremer has performed with some of the world's most prestigious orchestras, conductors and concert halls, but Wednesday marked the first time he played his 379-year-old Amati violin for prisoners.

The Pacific Institution in Abbotsford, B.C., is a federal penitentiary housing up to 400 inmates serving time for everything from property crimes to murder.

About a quarter of them signed up to hear Preludes to a Lost Time by Mieczyslaw Weinberg and Chaconne by J. S. Bach played by the Latvian master violinist.

The concert is a gift to the prisoners from the Looking at the Stars Foundation, a Toronto-based charitable organization that delivers classical music to those without access to traditional venues.

Watch part of Gidon Kremer's performance at the Pacific Institution:

As the inmates filed in from their maximum and medium security units, each one was searched by prison guards and a sniffer dog before they entered a gymnasium filled with rows of plastic chairs.

""I think music is something that can give warmth to everyone in trouble, in prison or not in prison,"" said 72-year-old Kremer.

Inmates respond

Inmate Robert doesn't share his last name or why he's in prison, but says he came to hear the violin because where he comes from it's used to accompany square dancers and this would be a different experience.

As well, he said, he's heard of Kremer in the past.

Robert says he would like to see a classical music program in the prison.

""For the lower-functioning inmates, it would be good for them for therapy,"" he said. ""They come out of their bubble. They come out of their shell.""

Robert missed a performance by a classical pianist at the institution in April 2019 and he says inmates later talked about how much they enjoyed the concert.

He believes prisoners will be able to talk about how they feel through music.

Questions for maestro

At the end of the concert the inmates were given a chance to ask Kremer questions.

They wanted to know about other musicians like Vivaldi, how old Kremer was when he first started to play the violin, who played his Amati violin made in 1641 before he played it.

But mostly they wanted to say thank you to Kremer for coming and playing for them one of the most complicated pieces of music.

""I have to say that in some ways they were more attentive or more enthusiastic compared to some concert audiences,"" said Kremer. ""I'm happy to have been here.""

Kremer describes his experience of playing for an audience of inmates:

In Gidon Kremer's own words CBC News BC 0:59 Gidon Kremer describes playing for an audience of inmates. 0:59

If he's ever invited to play at a prison again Kremer says he would say yes immediately.

The inmates gave him several rousing standing ovations.

Music restores dignity

The Looking at the Stars Foundation was created by Dmitri Kanovich, who came to Canada as a refugee from Lithuania in 1983 and went on to build a successful career in information technology.

An entrepreneur and lover of classical music, Kanovich says he created the foundation as way to give back to Canada.

Music, he says, is a way for inmates to retain dignity, to be treated like human beings.

He knows they have committed serious crimes and being in jail, he says, is ""well-deserved"" but prison is where recovery must begin.

""We owe them this recovery because they will rejoin us in society inevitably,"" he said.

Dmitri Kanovich describes his motivation behind bringing classical music performances into prisons:

At every concert Kanovich stands at the door to gymnasium and shakes hands with each inmate coming into the room.

Since the foundation was established in 2015 it has hosted 37 concerts in 15 Canadian prisons.

The Pacific Institution concert was presented in partnership with the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra (VSO).

""The audience was spellbound for an hour,"" said VSO president and CEO Angela Elster.

Music, she says, has incredible power to heal and connect.

To that end, an initiative in the works between the VSO and Corrections Canada called Play It Again will help inmates come back to instruments they may have played in the past or would like to play.

PARIS -- France's environment minister has announced a gradual ban on using wild animals in traveling circuses, on keeping dolphins and killer whales in captivity in marine parks and on raising mink on fur farms.

Barbara Pompili, France's minister of ecological transition, said in a news conference Tuesday that bears, tigers, lions, elephants and other wild animals won't be allowed any more in travelling circuses “in the coming years.”

In addition, starting immediately, France’s three marine parks won’t be able to bring in nor breed dolphins and killer whales any more, she said.

“It is time to open a new era in our relationship with these (wild) animals,” she said, arguing that animal welfare is a priority.

Pompili said the measures will also bring an end to mink farming, where animals are raised for their fur, within the next five years.

The ban does not apply to wild animals in other permanent shows and in zoos.

Pompili did not set any precise date for the ban in travelling circuses, saying the process should start “as soon as possible.” She promised solutions will be found for each animal “on a case-by-case basis.”

The French government will implement an 8 million-euro ($9.2 million) package to help people working in circuses and marine parks find other jobs.

“That transition will be spread over several years, because it will change the lives of many people,"" she said.",https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/france-ban-wild-animals-circuses-marine-parks-73307384

Several large groups of armed men operate in Zamfara state, described by the government as bandits, and are known to kidnap for money and for the release of their members from jail.

The government has repeatedly denied paying ransoms.

But President Muhammadu Buhari issued a statement on Friday in which he urged state governments ""to review their policy of rewarding bandits with money and vehicles, warning that the policy might boomerang disastrously"".

Sparks said the latest incident prompted more questions on the ransom debate.

""Was money paid? This is becoming a growth industry in Nigeria.

""It's happening frequently: Criminal gangs or bandits taking advantage of the precarious security situation in the north and central areas.""

Such kidnappings in Nigeria were first carried out by jihadist group Boko Haram, and later its offshoot Islamic State West Africa Province, but the tactic has now been adopted by other criminal gangs.

The raid in Zamfara state was the second such kidnapping in little over a week in the northwest, a region increasingly targeted by criminal gangs.

Authorities said the shooting spree began at the teen's house about 2 miles from the school, where he gunned down his 47-year-old father, Jeffrey Osborne. Authorities have not released the suspect's name or age beyond saying he's a teen.

Crying and upset, the teen called his grandmother's cellphone at 1:44 pm, Anderson County Coroner Greg Shore said. The grandparents couldn't understand what was going on, so they went to his home just 100 yards away. When they got there, they found Osborne dead and their grandson gone.

About one minute later, authorities received a 911 call from a teacher at the school in this rural town about 110 miles northeast of Atlanta.

The shooter drove a truck into the school parking lot and immediately started firing as he got out and moved toward the school, Mr Skipper said. He did not know who the truck the teen drove was registered to and declined to say how many shots were fired.

Television images showed officers swarming the school after the report of an active shooter. Some were on top of the roof while others were walking around the building. Students were driven away on buses accompanied by police officers to a nearby church.

“There are no racial undertones there. There's no terrorism involved,” Mr Major said. “We're confident we have the sole shooter and no one else is involved.”

Mr Skipper said the teen's mother was at work at the time of the shooting.

One of the students and the teacher were released from the hospital Wednesday evening, AnMed Health spokeswoman Juana Slade said. Greenville Health System spokeswoman Sandy Dees said the other student, Jacob Hall, remained in critical condition.

""[My son] said to me, 'If you want to help yourself, help somebody else.'""

And so he got to work, knitting every week.

All five living former US presidents make rare appearance together,"All five living former US presidents make rare appearance together - Presidents gather for fundraiser for those affected by hurricanes that struck Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands",1.0,"The five living former US presidents made a rare appearance together on stage on Saturday night at a fundraiser for those affected by recent hurricanes that struck Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.

It was a show of unity and compassion after a week in which Barack Obama and George W Bush broke an unwritten rule to deliver implicit criticism of the present occupant of the White House.

While neither mentioned Donald Trump by name, Bush gave a speech in New York expressing concern that “bigotry seems emboldened” in a climate of cruel rhetoric and nativism, while Obama referred to the “politics of division” and “folks who are deliberately trying to make folks angry” at Democratic campaign stops in New Jersey and Virginia.

Politics was set aside for the sold-out concert at Texas A&M University’s Reed Arena, however, as Bush, Obama, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and George HW Bush were given a rapturous welcome by the audience. Both Bushes live in Texas and the 41st president’s library and museum is on the A&M campus.

The event, Deep From The Heart: The One America Appeal, featured a host of country and gospel music stars. It was launched last month after Hurricane Harvey battered Texas and expanded when Hurricane Irma hit Florida and Hurricane Maria devastated parts of the Caribbean, together causing several hundred deaths and billions of dollars in damage.

Trump, whose response to relief efforts in Puerto Rico has come under fire, has frequently denigrated Obama and earlier this year baselessly claimed his predecessor in the Oval Office ordered Trump Tower to be wiretapped before the 2016 election. Last Monday he intimated Obama and other former presidents treated the families of dead military members with a lack of respect.

However, he recorded a two-minute video message for the appeal which was rather more collegial in tone. “Now, as we begin to rebuild, some of America’s finest public servants are spearheading the One America Appeal. Through this effort, all five living former presidents are playing a tremendous role in helping our fellow citizens recover,” he said.

“[First Lady] Melania and I want to express our deep gratitude for your tremendous assistance. This wonderful effort reminds us that we truly are one nation, under God, all unified by our values and our devotion to one another.”",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/22/all-five-living-former-us-presidents-make-rare-appearance-together
India's gay prince opens his palace to LGBT people,India's gay prince opens his palace to LGBT people,1.0,"A gay Indian prince has opened up his 15-acre palace grounds to vulnerable LGBT people and is said to be constructing more buildings to house visitors.

Prince Manvendra Singh Gohil, who is the son and probable heir of the Maharaja of Rajpipla in Gujarat in western India, will run the centre with his organisation The Lakshya Trust.

The royal, who was ostracised by his family after coming out publically in 2006, started the community based organisation to support gay men and educate people about the prevention of HIV/Aids.

Homosexuality remains a big taboo in Indian society and sex between people of the same gender is punishable by law in the country.

The controversial Section 377 of the country’s penal code bans sexual activity that is “against the order of nature” and many have interpreted the wording to include gay sex.

Recommended India declares freedom of sexual orientation a fundamental right

Speaking to the International Business Times, the prince said he was keen to empower people with the social security system they need to ensure they are not left with nothing if their families disown them after coming out.

""If I could undergo these problems then any other gay person could face a similar situation,” he said.

""In India, we have a family system and we are mentally conditioned to be with our parents. The moment you try to come out you are told you will be thrown out and society will boycott you. You become a social outcast. A lot of people are financially dependent on their parents.""

""I want to give people social and financial empowerment, so eventually people who want to come out won't be affected. They will have their own social security system. It won't make a difference if they are disinherited.""

The prince’s coming out was breaking news all over India at the time and resulted in effigies of him being burned in his home state and people calling for him to be denied his title. On top of this, he was disowned and disinherited by his parents.

Since then he has been the subject of BBC series Undercover Princes – a 2009 reality TV show which took three royals from their respective cultures and put them in Brighton where they were forced to “live and date”.

Prince Manvendra's charity provides counselling, clinical services and support groups to thousands of men who have sex with men. Many of the men in question have yielded to cultural burdens to marry women despite their sexuality.

The prince himself was forced into marriage in 1991 but has since said the relationship was ""a total disaster"". It resulted in divorce the following year.

Prince Manvendra, who had a highly traditional and conservative upbringing, appeared as a guest on The Oprah Winfrey Show back in 2007. He was one of three persons featured on the show titled “Gay Around the World”, saying he does not regret coming out and that he thinks the people living in his state admire him for the leading role he has taken in preventing and educating about HIV/Aids.

Last summer, India’s Supreme Court issued a historic ruling confirming the right of the country’s LGBT people to express their sexuality without discrimination.

Judges in India ruled sexual orientation is covered under clauses in the Indian Constitution that link to liberty in spite of the government claiming there was no legal right to privacy. The ruling leads the way for discriminatory practices against LGBT people in the country to be challenged in the courts.",http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/prince-manvendra-singh-gohil-palace-lgbt-people-a8146491.html

HIV vaccine in 2021? Leading experts 'optimistic' about ongoing trials,HIV vaccine in 2021? Leading experts 'optimistic' about ongoing trials,1.0,"The global fight against the human immunodeficiency virus is poised to make important advances thanks to three experimental HIV vaccines that are entering the final stages of testing at sites across the globe.

While any of these three late-stage HIV vaccine trials — known as HVTN 702, Imbokodo and Mosaico — could fail, scientists say they are more hopeful than at any time since 1984, when Secretary of Health and Human Services Margaret Heckler raised hopes by predicting that there would be a test-worthy HIV vaccine within two years.

This is “perhaps one of the most optimistic moments we have been in,"" said Dr. Susan Buchbinder, director of the Bridge HIV research program at the San Francisco Department of Public Health and a chair of both the Imbokodo and Mosaico trials.

“We have three vaccines currently being tested in efficacy trials,"" she said, ""and it takes quite a bit to actually be promising enough in the earlier stages stages of trials to move you forward into an efficacy study.""

HVTN 702

The oldest ongoing HIV vaccine trial, known as HVTN 702, is based on a prior vaccine candidate, RV144, that was effective, but not effective enough. In 2009, the RV144 clinical trial released findings showing that the vaccine lowered the rate of HIV infections by about 30 percent. To this day, RV144 remains the only HIV vaccine that have ever demonstrated any efficacy against the virus.

HVTN 702, launched in South Africa in 2016, was the first vaccine trial approved after the failure of RV144. According to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the modified vaccination regime “aims to provide greater and more sustained protection than the RV144 regimen and has been adapted to the HIV subtype that predominates in southern Africa,” also known as HIV-1 clade C.

While RV144, at 30 percent effective, did not suffice for global distribution, it pointed the way forward for vaccine researchers, who adapted RV144’s successes to create HVTN 702. Buchbinder said even a partially effective vaccine would be “a tremendous breakthrough,” and ""would really have the power to change the trajectory of the epidemic.”

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of NIAID and a longtime advocate for a vaccine that is at least 50 percent effective, said he feels “even more strongly now” that a partially effective vaccine would be worth deploying. He said that is because prevention strategies like pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and treatment as prevention (TasP) “are being so successfully used, even in the absence of a vaccine, that if one or more of these vaccines look good, have a 50-60 percent efficacy, I think that’s going to be the game changer for turning the epidemic around.”

HVTN 702 completed enrollment this summer, and clinical results are expected in late 2020 or early 2021.

Imbokodo and Mosaico

Imbokodo, the second trial, began in five southern African nations in 2017 and completed enrollment of 2,600 women this summer. In southern African nations, heterosexual women are at extremely high risk of HIV infection.

“It’s almost unbelievable, but it’s true, women between the ages of 18 and 25 — the prevalence of infection is well over 50 percent,” Fauci said. “If ever you wanted to get a population that, if the vaccine works, you’re going to know pretty quickly, then you want to go in women.”

Unlike HVTN 702, Imbokodo uses “mosaic” immunogens, which are “vaccine components designed to induce immune responses against a wide variety of global HIV strains,” according to the National Institutes of Health.

“The presumption is that a mosaic is going to give you broader coverage,” Fauci said.

In November, the third vaccine trial, Mosaico, marked its informal start after the first study participant received an injection. Mosaico is based on Imbokodo’s unique mosaic immunogen approach.

Imbokodo and Mosaico are largely identical and consist of six injections, with slightly different vaccine formulations administered during the final two clinic visits.

In addition, while Imbokodo is only being tested in African women, Mosaico will recruit 3,800 gay men and transgender people for its clinical trials at 57 sites in the United States, Latin America and Europe. For any HIV vaccine, Fauci said there’s a need to prove it works in different at-risk populations.

Imbokodo completed enrollment of study participants this summer, marking the formal end of the recruitment process. Results from Imbokodo are expected in 2021, and results from Mosaico are expected in 2023.

Challenges ahead

Fauci noted that there has been a rapid pace of vaccine-related developments in recent years, with these three vaccine trials starting in 2016, 2017 and 2019.

“In all of these trials, intermittently the data and safety monitoring board takes a look at the data, and either says the data are so bad you have got to stop, or the data are so overwhelmingly good that you have got to stop,” Fauci said. So far, after several reviews of the data in HVTN 702 and Imbokodo, “there’s nothing there to say stop the study,” which happened in 2007 when a Merck vaccine trial was shut down after the monitoring board determined that it had no impact on prevention.

""None of these vaccines is a particularly simple regimen,"" Buchbinder said, ""so it’s going to require quite a bit of effort to deploy.”

“They require multiple injections, and so each one would require a minimum of four different doses in its current configuration,” Buchbinder said. But an effective vaccine could be a “stepping off point” to potentially create a simpler and more effective vaccine in the future.

And if these vaccine trials all fail, public health officials say enough tools currently exist to stop the spread of HIV — if only people would, or could, use them.

PrEP, the daily pill that prevents HIV infection, is safe and effective, but not enough people are using it to slow HIV transmission and end the epidemic. And successful treatment of people living with HIV results in an undetectable viral load that they cannot transmit the virus via sexual activity, known as “treatment as prevention” or TasP.

“It goes exactly to what I have been saying for years and years — if you implement the tools that you have, you will definitely see an impact on the dynamics of the epidemic,” Fauci said. “I have been talking about this for well over a decade. If you implement, the incidence is going to go down. It happened dramatically in San Francisco, and it is happening right now in New York.”

Fauci said President Donald Trump’s Ending the HIV Epidemic plan, which Fauci played a central role in drafting, aims to lower new infections by 75 percent in five years and by 90 percent in 10 years “even in the absence of a vaccine.”

So, if one of the three vaccines currently being tested works, “that would be the endgame,"" she said.

TN Promise offers free college tuition. But high school seniors must apply now,Tennessee offers 2 years FREE college tuition to any high school graduate,1.0,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WTVF) — Sending your kids to college these days is not cheap.

But the state of Tennessee is offering free money for college. That's right. How does free college tuition sound? Under Governor Bill Haslam, Tennessee started a program for high seniors called Tennessee Promise. The program provides a free college education to any graduating senior in the state.

""This is a great program because we are the only state in the country that can offer free community and technical college to any of our citizens,"" Graham Thomas with Tennessee Promise explained.

The TN Promise program provides two years of free tuition to any of Tennessee's community colleges or colleges of applied technology, as well as a handful of four-year universities.

There are no income requirements or GPA requirements.

""The only requirement is that you are graduating from a Tennessee high school and that you have lived here at least a year,"" Thomas said.

That's it. Once you apply, you're in.

It's literally free money for college. Students are also paired with a volunteer mentor.

""We give them someone who is in their corner advocating for them, fighting for them, making sure they’re meeting their deadlines. And I’ve always said that it’s the most important role. And in the midst of a worldwide pandemic, I would say it’s the most important role, being their cheerleader, just letting them know that hey you can do this,"" Thomas said.

The deadline to apply is just around the corner. It's next Monday, November 2. Applying is easy and takes just minutes. And while you might think this isn't for you, Thomas said it's always good to keep your options open.

""Even if you think I’m going to UT or I am going to go out of state, I am going to MTSU, TSU. Apply! It never hurts to have a back-up plan. And we all know that things happen between now and August,"" Thomas added.

Applications, right now, are way down. That's likely because many high schools are virtual right now and normally, it's high school counselors and teachers who help students apply in class.

But Thomas said don't let that stop you.

""Once we get an application on file from students, we get their phone numbers and we get their emails, they are going to get a mentor. So we’re going to start putting supports around them immediately and we know if we put those supports around them, we can, one, get them get them into college and, two, make sure they’re successful. But until they apply we don’t know who they are,"" Thomas explained.

Once students you are accepted, to keep the scholarship, students must meet with their mentor twice, once in the spring of their senior year and then again in the fall of their freshman year. Those meetings, due to the pandemic, will be online. Students must also keep a 2.0 GPA and do 8 hours of community service.

A lot of kids are going to see 'Black Panther' thanks to this GoFundMe,Fundraiser to help Harlem children see Marvel's Black Panther more than doubles goal,1.0,"A crowdfunding campaign to help children in Harlem see Black Panther in February has more than doubled its goal and now includes celebrity donors as well.

The fundraiser is currently at over $24,000 of its $10,000 goal, with all extra proceeds going to the Boys & Girls Club of Harlem.

“The release of Marvel’s film the Black Panther is a rare opportunity for young students (primarily of color) to see a black major cinematic and comic book character come to life,” campaign organizer Frederick Joseph wrote in the GoFundMe description. “This representation is truly fundamental for young people, especially those who are often underserved, unprivileged, and marginalized both nationally and globally.”

The campaign will send approximately 300 kids to see Black Panther in theaters and covers the cost of a Manhattan movie ticket, snacks, and adult chaperones. Joseph received criticism about the pricing on Twitter, but for the most part feedback for his campaign has been positive.

The GoFundMe also caught the attention of J.J. Abrams and wife Katie McGrath, who donated $10,000, among others.

Just contributed to support @FredTJoseph’s effort to bring Harlem kids to see #BlackPanther. If you also believe representation matters & you’re able, I hope you’ll consider supporting, thank you: https://t.co/vaLO7JmEwl — Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) January 8, 2018

Rob Marriner said he stood underneath the water for one hour, until it ran cold. Then he went to sleep for nine hours - the longest he has been able to sleep in years.

Marriner had been homeless since 1984. For 33 years he roamed the streets of West Auckland.

MAHVASH ALI/FAIRFAX Rob Marriner this week moved into private rented accommodation.

""I still remember the day I moved out of my home. My father's abuse drove me out.""

But he moved into a two-bedroom one-bathroom house in Sunnyvale this week.

MAHVASH ALI/FAIRFAX ""This is my house,"" says Rob Marriner, standing in the doorway of his home after 33 years on the streets.

His new home has furniture, courtesy of St John New Zealand, and he even has a flatmate.

But Marriner said living under a roof could be daunting.

""It's scary, spooky and strange.""

MAHVASH ALI/FAIRFAX NZ Marriner says he is living ""the life of luxury"" now.

He said he felt like a baby having to adjust to a completely new way of life.

On his first night in the house he ended up having a cold pie for dinner because he did not know how to turn on the oven.

""We left our pies in the oven for two hours and still ended up having them cold. I did not know there was a switch.""

MAHVASH ALI/FAIRFAX Marriner says he did not know the oven had to be switched on to work so he had a cold pie for dinner.

However, the next morning he said he had a ""feast"" for breakfast with his flatmate.

""We had 24 eggs with two loaves of bread. We figured out how to turn the thing on.""

Marriner said living in a home was the ""life of luxury"".

MAHVASH ALI/FAIRFAX NZ ""The streets have many secrets,"" says Rob Marriner.

""You can have coffee when you want and open the fridge when you like.""

He said he could not sleep the first night in his new home.

""We moved the furniture about four times from room to room.""

Marriner said it was nice to make a bed in the morning instead of wrapping up his bedding at the break of dawn like he had done for 33 years.

He was also getting used to washing his clothes.

The 54-year-old said he always dreamt of living in a home.

It was after two deaths in his family that he became more serious about achieving his dream.

Marriner's sister was murdered in 2014. The following year he said his mother died of a ""broken heart"".

""She couldn't deal with my sister's death.""

He became involved with Taniwha Tales, an initiative of Te Whanau o Waipareira Trust launched in 2015, aimed at helping the homeless find a safe place in society.

Through them he found a new life and a new home, he said.

On the streets he would go to The Salvation Army and get whatever had been donated to charity, and Marriner said he found ways to get food, shelter and stay warm.

""The streets have many secrets,"" he said.

But there was one thing he did miss about being homeless.

Asda, Morrisons, Sainsbury's and Tesco made the move after fuel retailers were accused of not passing on savings from lower wholesale costs.

Over the past six months, the cost of filling up a typical 55-litre family car that runs on petrol or diesel has risen by around £6.

Asda, Morrisons, Sainsbury's and Tesco cut their prices after fuel retailers were accused of not passing on savings from lower wholesale costs. Pictured: An Asda station in south-east London

The average cost of fuel at UK filling stations stands at £1.30 per litre for petrol, according to new Government figures.

Asda said the 2p price cut would now mean customers would never pay more than 122.7p per litre for petrol and 134.7 for diesel.

Owners of diesel vehicles have been hit by fuel price rises for 18 consecutive weeks, reaching an average of £1.37 per litre.

The last time diesel was this expensive was March 2014.

AA fuel spokesman Luke Bosdet said he 'watched with dismay' as petrol pump prices 'trickled down by barely a penny' last month despite the wholesale price falling by 4p per litre.

The RAC described the supermarket price drop as 'excellent news', but insisted it is 'long overdue' as fuel retailers have 'not played fair with drivers in a falling wholesale market'.

Parkinson’s disease is a condition that causes the brain to become progressively more damaged over time, according to the NHS. It’s caused by a loss of nerve cells in a specific part of the brain, which are used to help send messages between the brain and nervous system. The most common Parkinson’s disease symptoms include tremors and slow movement. But, you could lower your risk of developing the brain condition by drinking coffee, scientists have revealed.

Coffee consumption does seem to have some correlation to a decreased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease Dr Donald Weaver

Regularly drinking coffee could help to prevent Parkinson’s disease, as well as Alzheimer’s disease, said scientists from the Krembil Brain Institute, in Canada. Coffee contains compounds, known as phenylindanes, that inhibit proteins from forming that are linked to the brain conditions, they said. Dark-roasted coffee beans provided the best protection, as roasting tends to lead to higher amounts of the compounds. “Coffee consumption does seem to have some correlation to a decreased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease,” said Dr Donald Weaver, Co-Director of the Krembil Brain Institute. “Mother Nature is a much better chemist than we are and Mother Nature is able to make these compounds. “If you have a complicated compound, it's nicer to grow it in a crop, harvest the crop, grind the crop out and extract it than try to make it.”

Parkinson's disease diet: Prevent brain condition's symptoms by drinking more coffee

The researchers are now investigating how beneficial the phenylindanes are, and whether they can enter the bloodstream. But, much more research is needed before coffee’s compounds can be turned into a medical treatment. “What this study does is take the epidemiological evidence and try to refine it and to demonstrate that there are indeed components within coffee that are beneficial to warding off cognitive decline,” said Weaver. “It's interesting, but are we suggesting that coffee is a cure? Absolutely not.” Those most at risk of developing Parkinson’s disease are people over 50 years old, said the NHS.

Gus Hutt, who normally fishes 100 metres from the spot he did that morning, was casting his line when he saw the small figure floating in the water.

The little boy had somehow escaped from a tent where he family was staying and got to the beach.

‘As he floated past I thought he was just a doll’

Mr Hutt, who was fishing on Matata beach, at the Bay of Plenty in New Zealand, told Whakatane Beacon: “I reached out and grabbed him by the arm; even then I still thought it was just a doll.

“His face looked just like porcelain with his short hair wetted down, but then and he let out a little squeak and I thought ‘oh God this is a baby and it’s alive’.”

The 18-month-old escaped from the nearby tent by pulling at the zip and crawling out onto the beach.

The family were staying at Murphy’s Holiday Camp when the boy escaped from the enclosure.

The boy’s mother, Jessica Whyte, was woken by camp managers who told her what had happened.

“I don’t think my heart [beat] from hearing that to seeing him. I don’t think my heart worked,” she said.

Mr Hutt told the New Zealand Herald: “He was floating at a steady pace with a rip in the water. If I hadn’t been there, or if I had just been a minute later I wouldn’t have seen him.

“He was bloody lucky, but he just wasn’t meant to go; it wasn’t his time.”

Opened a tent zip

The boy was treated the boy for 15 minutes before an ambulance arrived to take him to Whakatane Hospital.

Speaking about the new Alexa skill, Addie Mitchell, clinical nurse specialist at Breast Cancer Care, said: “We know a third of women in the UK aren’t regularly checking their breasts, so having Alexa on hand to guide them will help empower many with the confidence to build this potentially lifesaving habit into their routine.

“Whatever your age it’s so important to get to know your breasts, and if you do spot anything unusual – be it a lump, redness or an inverted nipple - get it checked out by your GP.”

British Heart Foundation: donate furniture and money

The British Heart Foundation (BHF) became the first UK charity to receive donations through Amazon Pay via Alexa earlier this year.

By enabling the BHS skill in the Alexa app or simply speaking to an Amazon Echo, people can make one-off donations or organise a collection of unwanted furniture and electrical items which will then be sold in one of the charities stores around the UK.

To activate this feature, say: “Alexa, ask British Heart Foundation to collect my furniture”, or “Alexa, open British Heart Foundation and donate money.”

Once you make a donation, Londoner Rebecca Shorrocks who was diagnosed with a rare genetic heart muscle disease last year, then shares her story and thanks supporters.

It’s never been easier to contribute to a charity and make a difference.

BHF said it is embracing new technologies in order to discover alternative ways to fund its research.

“We’re constantly adapting as an organisation to be where our supporters are and to give people choice to make donating as easy as possible. We’re excited to add the Amazon Alexa onto a long list of ways that people can help fund our life-saving research,” said the charity’s chief executive, Simon Gillespie.

Cancer Research UK: alcohol tracking

We all know that drinking alcohol can cause cancer, even if many of us choose to shun the warnings on a Friday night in the pub. As a result, Cancer Research UK’s Alexa skill wants to help us understand our alcohol intake and keep track of units through Amazon Echo.

Using the My Alcohol Tracker skill, you can set a goal of how many units you want to drink that week, add drinks to the weekly total and get a summary of how well you’re doing.

Alexa can also tell you hints and tips on ways to cut down, as well as how many doughnuts a glass of wine is, which may help you to reconsider your drinking.

Tiffany Hall, Cancer Research UK’s chief information officer told the Standard: “At Cancer Research UK we’ve explored using voice-enabled speakers as a new way for people to get health information. The My Alcohol Tracker Alexa Skill lets users track how much they’re drinking and set goals to cut down. It also helps raise awareness of the link between alcohol and cancer.

“We’re always trying to innovate and we’ll continue to look for opportunities for technology to give people access to information about cancer.”

Cancer Research UK is taking advantage of Alexa in other ways. If you listen to the news in the morning, you can enable the charity’s Science blog flash briefing which will give you the headlines and the top four recent articles from the blog.

Revolutionary device allowed frogs to regenerate lost limbs,Revolutionary device allowed frogs to regenerate lost limbs,1.0,"Frogs with amputated legs had enhanced limb regeneration when fitted with a revolutionary device.

Scientists claim this so-called 'bioreactor' helps the animals regrow legs by 'kick-starting' the advanced healing process using the hormone progesterone.

Progesterone is crucial to pregnancy and it is now believed that the chemical could help find a cure for spinal cord injuries.

Scientists claim this so-called 'bioreactor' helps the animals regrow legs by 'kick-starting' the advanced healing process using the hormone progesterone

Adult aquatic African clawed frogs were fitted with a specialist 'bioreactor' that uses the hormone progesterone to improve healing.

Findings, published today in the Journal Cell Reports, introduce a new model for testing 'electroceuticals' - or cell-stimulating therapies.

Study senior author Dr Michael Levin, developmental biologist at Tufts University, said: 'At best, adult frogs normally grow back only a featureless, thin, cartilaginous spike

'Our procedure induced a regenerative response they normally never have, which resulted in bigger, more structured appendages.

'The bioreactor device triggered very complex downstream outcomes that bioengineers cannot yet micromanage directly.'

The scientists 3D printed the bioreactor out of silicon and filled it with hydrogel - a sticky glob of polymers.

They laced the hydrogel with hydrating silk proteins that promote healing and regeneration before adding progesterone.

Progesterone is a steroid hormone which is best known for its pivotal role in the menstrual and ovulation cycle performed every month by women.

It is also known to promote nerve, blood vessel, and bone tissue repair.

The researchers split the frogs into three groups: experimental, control, and sham.

For the experimental and sham group, they sutured the device on the frogs immediately after limb amputation.

In the experimental group, the bioreactor released progesterone onto the amputation site. In all cases, they removed the devices after 24 hours.

When they looked at frogs in the experimental group at different stages over nine-and-a-half months.

The team witnessed the bioreactor instigated a degree of limb regeneration not observed in the other groups.

Instead of a spike-like structure, the bioreactor treatment resulted in a paddle-like growth that resembled a fully formed limb.

Dr Levin said: 'The bioreactor device created a supportive environment for the wound where the tissue could grow as it did during embryogenesis.

'A very brief application of bioreactor and its payload triggered months of tissue growth and patterning.'

When Dr Levin and his team took a closer look at the regenerated structures they saw that, unlike in the control and sham groups, the limbs of the bioreactor-treated frogs were thicker with more developed bones, innervation, and vascularisation.

The team also analysed video footage of the frogs in their tanks found the frogs treated with progesterone could swim more like unamputated frogs.

Further analysis revealed that the bioreactor had altered the gene expression occurring in cells at the amputation site.

Dr Levin explained that genes involved in oxidative stress, serotonergic signalling, and white blood cell activity were upregulated, while some other signaling-related genes were downregulated.

WHAT IS PROGESTERONE? Progesterone is a hormone that is secreted by the corpus luteum, a temporary endocrine gland that the female body produces after ovulation. It prepares the body for the possibility of pregnancy after ovulation. It causes a thickening of the uterus lining to allow for an egg to embed into the wall. After a woman's cycle is completed and they are not pregnant the gland breaks down and the menstrual cycle begins. If a woman does become pregnant the chemical continues to be produced to maintain the layer and provide oxygen to the developing fetus. Said to be 'oestrogen's cousin' or the 'relaxing hormone', is thought to help to maintain pregnancy. It is not typically prescribed on the NHS in the UK unless a woman has three or more miscarriages in a row. If progesterone levels are too low with regard to estrogen levels, a woman will experience sleep disturbances, irritability, anxiety, weight gain, breast swelling, breast tenderness, and itching, bloating, sweating, loss of memory, and loss of libido. Despite its widespread use in pregnancy the hormone has also been shown to promote nerve, blood vessel, and bone tissue repair. This has therefore brought around applications in tissue regeneration.

The researchers also observed that scarring and immune responses were downregulated in the bioreactor-treated frogs, suggesting that the added progesterone dampened the body's natural reaction to injury in a way that benefited the regeneration process.

Dr Celia Herrera-Rincon, a neuroscientist in Dr Levin's lab at Tufts University, said: 'In both reproduction and its newly discovered role in brain functioning, progesterone's actions are local or tissue-specific.

'What we are demonstrating with this approach is that maybe reproduction, brain processing, and regeneration are closer than we think.

'Maybe they share pathways and elements of a common--and so far, not completely understood - bioelectrical code.'

The team also analysed video footage of the frogs in their tanks found the frogs treated with progesterone could swim more like unamputated frogs. Further analysis revealed that the bioreactor had altered the gene expression occurring in cells at the amputation site

Dr Levin said his team will continue to target bioelectric processes for inducing spinal cord regeneration and tumour reprogramming.

They also hope to replicate their bioreactor experiment in mammals.

Previous research suggests that mice can partially regenerate amputated fingertips in the right conditions, but their life on land hinders the process.

Dr Levin added: 'Almost all good regenerators are aquatic.

'You can imagine why this matters: a mouse that loses a finger or hand, and then grinds the delicate regenerative cells into the flooring material as it walks around, is unlikely to experience significant limb regeneration.'

Now he plans to add sensors to the device for remote monitoring and stimulation, which he hopes will improve control over cellular decision making after injury.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-6358967/Revolutionary-device-allowed-frogs-regenerate-lost-limbs.html
"Taxing beef, lamb and pork 'could prevent about 220,000 deaths a year'","Taxing beef, lamb and pork 'could prevent about 220,000 deaths a year'",1.0,"A 'meat tax' on bacon, burgers and beef could save 220,000 lives and £30.7billion around the world within two years, experts say.

Making red meat, heavily linked to cancer and heart disease, more expensive could encourage people to switch to eating healthier alternatives.

In the UK, this could prevent 6,000 deaths a year and save more than £700million which would otherwise have been spent on healthcare.

But it could hike the price of red meat like mince and steak by 14 per cent, and the cost of processed meat like bacon and burgers by 79 per cent.

Oxford University researchers said eating red and processed meat kills 2.4million people a year and costs the global economy £219billion.

They acknowledged 'no-one wants governments to tell people what they can eat' but cutting down red meat would be better for human health and for the earth.

In the UK, an optimal meat tax could increase the cost of red meat by 14 per cent and processed meat by 79 per cent, researchers say, which would put prices up on supermarket shelves (pictured: examples of how supermarket prices could change, based on prices on Tesco Direct)

Lead researcher Dr Marco Springmann said: 'The consumption of red and processed meat exceeds recommended levels in most high and middle-income countries.

'This is having significant impacts not only on personal health, but also on healthcare systems, which are taxpayer-funded in many countries, and on the economy, which is losing its labour force due to ill health and care for family members who fall ill.

'I hope governments will consider introducing a health levy on red and processed meat to make healthy and sustainable decision-making easier for consumers.

'A health levy on red and processed meat would not limit choices, but send a powerful signal to consumers and take pressure off our healthcare systems.'

The size of the meat tax would vary in different countries around the world, depending on how much meat they eat and how much it costs to buy.

The study estimated a tax could reduce the intake of processed meat like bacon and sausages by around two portions a week in high-income countries.

FIVE WAYS TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO EAT LESS MEAT Filippo Bianchi, an expert researcher at Oxford University has suggested five ways society can discourage people from eating as much red meat, which is linked to cancer, heart disease and type 2 diabetes. He writes for The Conversation: 1. Reduce portion size Reducing the default portion size of meat products is a promising way forward. One study found that downsizing the default portion size of meat dishes in restaurants got each customer to consume on average 28g less meat in these dishes, without affecting their overall restaurant experience. Another study found that adding smaller sausages to supermarket shelves was linked with a 13% reduction in meat purchases. So, simply making smaller meat portions available in supermarkets could also help to cut down meat consumption. 2. Design greener menus How foods are displayed on restaurant menus also makes a difference. Research has shown that creating an exclusive vegetarian section at the end of a restaurant menu actually reduces the likelihood of people trying plant-based foods. Instead, displaying the meat options on a separate restaurant board and only keeping plant-based options on the default paper menu made people four times more likely to go with a meat-free option, according to a study conducted in a simulated canteen. 3. Position meat out of sight Research showed that making veggie options more visible than meat at the counter of a university canteen was linked with a 6 per cent increase in the selection of meat-free dishes. And when it comes to a buffet setup, placing the meat options at the end of the aisle is probably the way to go. One small study found that this buffet layout could cut people’s meat intakes by up to 20 per cent. But given the small sample size, more research is needed to corroborate this finding. 4. Help people make the obvious connection Reminding people of where meat actually comes from can also make quite a difference to how much meat people end up eating. Research shows, for example, that presenting the image of a pork roast with the pig’s head still attached increases people’s demand for a plant-based alternative. 5. Develop delicious meat-free products Of course, making vegetarian dishes delicious sounding enough to compete with meat ones seems like a good idea. And a recent study found that increasing the look and appeal of meat-free options on the menu of a simulated university cafeteria doubled the amount of people who selected meat-free meals over traditional meat dishes. So while it’s still early days and much more research needs to be done to understand how to encourage people to eat less meat, ultimately, making meat-free options more appealing will be key to reducing long-term meat consumption.

Scientific evidence links eating red meat to cancer, heart disease and stroke, and restricting how much people eat by making it more expensive could cut down the number of people who die of related diseases, experts say

In the UK, the optimal tax level could increase the cost of red meat by 14 per cent and processed meat by 79 per cent, Dr Springmann said.

But the UK comes off fairly lightly – ideal processed meat tax in the US could be 163 per cent, whereas it could be 185 per cent in Sweden.

The UK figures could see the price of an eight-pack of Tesco British Pork Sausages rise from £1.70 to £3.04, for example.

Or four of Tesco's 1/4lb Beef Burgers could cost £4.48 instead of the current £2.50.

The price hike would be more modest for fresh red meat like steak – a sirloin steak might rise from £3.80 to £4.33, or lamb chops from £2.05 to £2.34.

In the US the tax would need to be higher, rising the cost of meat by 34 per cent and processed meat by 163 per cent.

HOW THE MEAT TAX COULD CHANGE SUPERMARKET PRICES Based on the possible tax rates of 14 per cent for unprocessed red meat and 79 per cent for processed meat, these are some examples of how Tesco prices could change: Tesco Smoked Back Bacon Rashers 300G Now: £1.50

With tax: £2.69 Tesco British Pork Sausages 8 Pack 454G Now: £1.70

With tax: £3.04 Tesco 4 1/4Lb Beef Burgers 454G Now: £2.50

With tax: £4.48 Tesco Beef Lean Steak Mince 500G 5% Fat Now: £3.39

With tax: £3.87 Tesco Sirloin Steak 227G Now: £3.80

With tax: £4.33 Tesco Lamb Chops 150G Now: £2.05

With tax: £2.34 Prices are all from Tesco Direct Advertisement

An effective tax in Sweden increased the price of processed meat by a whopping 185 per cent and that of red meat by 27 per cent.

But in China optimal tax levels were much lower – just seven per cent on red meat and 43 per cent on processed meat, the study found.

Taxing meat in Germany at an effective level led to red meat being 28 per cent more expensive and the price of processed meat rising by 166 per cent.

The same policy in Denmark resulted in red meat being taxed at 29 per cent and processed meat at 119 per cent.

The potential global benefits of a meat tax include a 16 per cent reduction in processed meat consumption, and the prevention of 222,000 deaths from cancer, heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes.

In addition, an estimated 3,800 deaths related to obesity would be prevented, the study found.

For the UK alone, an effective meat tax that offset healthcare costs would prevent 5,920 deaths per year. That would amount to a reduction of 15.6 per cent in the number of deaths attributed to eating meat.

Louise Meincke, from the World Cancer Research Fund, said: 'Governments need to implement more evidence-informed policies to help make our daily environments healthier so that it is easier for people to make these healthy choices.

'This research, looking at the potential effects of a meat tax, shows it could help reduce the level of meat consumption, similar to how a sugar-sweetened beverage tax works, as well as offset costs to the healthcare system and improve environmental sustainability.'

A higher tax on processed meat would price consumers out of eating so much and move them towards unprocessed meat, believed to be healthier, researchers said.

The World Health Organisation has classified beef, lamb and pork as carcinogenic – meaning they cause cancer – when eaten in processed form.

And the meats are still 'probably cancer-causing' when they're consumed unprocessed.

Red meat consumption has also been associated with increased rates of coronary heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes.

U.S. trial to tell epic tale of Mexican drug lord 'El Chapo',U.S. trial to tell epic tale of Mexican drug lord 'El Chapo',1.0,"NEW YORK -- The high-security trial of infamous Mexican drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman got underway on Tuesday, with a prosecutor telling jurors how the man who got his start in a modest marijuana-selling business in Mexico ruthlessly turned it into a blood-drenched smuggling operation that funneled cocaine and other drugs as far north as New York.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Adam Fels told a jury in a New York City courtroom that Guzman ""sent killers to wipe out competitors,"" and ""waged wars against longtime partners ... including his own cousins.""

Guzman, who has been held in solitary confinement since his extradition to the United States early last year, has pleaded not guilty to charges that he amassed a multi-billion-dollar fortune smuggling tons of cocaine and other drugs in a vast supply chain that reached New York, New Jersey, Texas and elsewhere north of the border.

If convicted, he faces a possible life prison sentence.

Prosecutors have said they will use thousands of documents, videos and recordings as evidence, including material related to drug smugglers' safe houses and Guzman's 2015 prison escape and the law enforcement operation to recapture him.

Fels described to jurors how Guzman started modestly in the early 1970s by selling marijuana in Mexico, but built his reputation by constructing tunnels across the Mexico-U.S. border to transport marijuana and cocaine so fast that he was ""no longer El Chapo, the short one."" Instead, he became known as ""the speedy one."" Before his tunnels, it had taken weeks to move drugs across the border to the U.S.

Before long, Guzman was receiving 10 to 15 planes ""stuffed with cocaine"" from Colombia at landing strips in Mexico for transport to cities like Los Angeles, Chicago and New York, Fels said.

As his business flourished using the tunnels, trains, planes and vessels, Guzman began taking aim at rivals in the early 1990s, leading to bloody wars. In 1993, he fled to Guatemala but was captured and imprisoned in Mexico for eight years, where he continued running his drug empire, Fels said.

The prosecutor spoke of two dramatic escapes from prison by Guzman and said he was planning a third when he was brought to the U.S.

Fels said Guzman used some of his wealth to pay off the Mexican military and police and to finance assault rifles, grenade launchers and explosives to engage in ""war after bloody war.""

More than a dozen co-operating witnesses are scheduled to testify, including some who worked for Guzman's Sinaloa cartel. Prosecutors say they risk retribution by taking the stand and the court has taken steps to conceal their identities. U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan barred courtroom sketch artists from drawing them.

Guzman's lawyers are expected to attack the credibility of the witnesses by emphasizing their criminal records, saying some have an incentive to lie to win leniency in their own cases.

One of Guzman's attorneys, Eduardo Balarezo, has suggested that he hopes to convince jurors Guzman wasn't actually in charge of the cartel but was a lieutenant taking orders from someone else.

""Now that trial is upon us, it is time to put up or shut up,"" Balarezo said.

Despite his diminutive stature and nickname that means ""Shorty,"" Guzman was once a larger-than-life figure in Mexico who has been compared to Al Capone and Robin Hood and been the subject of ballads called narcocorridos.

Among the highlights of his lore: He was known for carrying a gold-plated AK-47, for smuggling cocaine in cans marked as jalapenos and for making shipments using planes with secret landing strips as well as container ships, speedboats and even submarines.

But Guzman is perhaps best known for escaping custody in Mexico, the first time in 2011 by hiding in the bottom of a laundry bin. He escaped again in 2015 through a mile-long tunnel dug into a shower in his jail cell that he slipped into before fleeing on a motorcycle.

Guzman's second escape was a black eye for the Mexican government, an embarrassment amplified when the actor Sean Penn was able to find and interview him at one of his hideouts in Mexico while he was on the run from authorities.

Guzman's extradition to New York City shook up Mexico's drug underworld.

Mexican security analyst Alejandro Hope said it created ""something of a civil war within the Sinaloa cartel"" that has essentially ended with the arrest of internal rivals and allowed his sons to take control of what remains a ""weakened"" but far-from-finished smuggling operation.

Hope said he has seen no sign that Guzman's extradition and jailing in the U.S. had a major impact on drug flows or routes.

""But symbolically I think it's important. It's a bit of an end of an era. There are very few kingpins of that size left, of that importance,"" Hope said. ""We are actually leaving behind that era, the era of the kingpin."" Smaller gangs now dominate, he said.

Raul Benitez, a security expert and professor at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, said Guzman's oversized myth has been fading, too.

In Mexico, news stories about Guzman's trial have been prominent in the media even though it's viewed by some as old history.

""He is totally isolated. He cannot approach anyone. His wife was not even able to approach him. So he is now out of the game,"" Benitez said, referring to an order by the judge banning Guzman's wife from hugging him in the courtroom during the trial.

Whether he is out for good will be decided by an anonymous jury of 12 men and women who will decide the case. The trial is expected to last into next year.

"All adults should be screened for unhealthy alcohol use, new guidelines say","All adults should be screened for unhealthy alcohol use, new guidelines say",1.0,"(CNN) You can expect a ""drinking checkup"" when you visit the doctor. All adults, including pregnant women, should be screened for unhealthy alcohol use by their primary care physicians, the United States Preventive Services Task Force advises. For those patients who drink above the recommended limits, doctors should provide brief counseling to help them reduce their drinking, according to the new task force statement published Tuesday in the medical journal JAMA.

As far as teens, the independent panel of medical experts came up empty. The task force said it did not find enough evidence to make a recommendation for or against alcohol screening and counseling for those under the age of 18. The panel is calling for more research.

Unhealthy alcohol use means drinking beyond the recommended limits. No more than four drinks in a single day and 14 drinks in a week is the line drawn for men age 21 to 64, according to National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism . For women and older men, the institute advises no more than three drinks in one day and no more than seven drinks in a week. There is no safe level of alcohol for pregnant women, according to the institute.

The negative consequences of too much alcohol include illness, injury, and death -- unhealthy alcohol use ranks as the third leading preventable cause of death in the US according to the task force. When pregnant women drink, birth defects and developmental problems in their children may follow.

Security restrictions removed in southern Israel as uncertain calm sets in,Security restrictions removed in southern Israel as uncertain calm sets in,1.0,"Opposition leaders slam Netanyahu over reported truce with Hamas

The leaders of the Zionist Union and Yesh Atid are criticizing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for reportedly agreeing to a ceasefire agreement with Hamas following a major flare up in violence over the last 24 hours.

Livni calls the apparent decision to abide by the terms of the Egyptian-brokered truce “a colossal security failure on the part of the right-wing government,” and says the move dealt a “fatal blow to Israel’s deterrence.”

“Tonight it was made clear that the Right has no solution to security, but we do,” Livni says in a statement. “We put it on the table four years ago, and now it needs to be implemented.”

Labor leader Avi Gabbay also levels harsh criticism against Netanyahu, saying that his government’s policy regarding Hamas has failed the residents of Israel.

“For four years, Netanyahu has abandoned residents of the periphery and neglected the issues in Gaza,” he says in a statement.

“The residents of southern Israel shouldn’t have to hear about the ceasefire from Al Jazeera, they deserve genuine leadership that is prepared to look them in the eye and tell them the truth,” Gabbay says.",https://www.timesofisrael.com/as-rocket-attacks-persist-idf-says-its-preparing-to-recruit-reservists/

Haniyeh added, ""The resistance defended its people and themselves against Israeli aggression, and the Palestinian people, as usual, adopted the resistance with patience and pride.""

Meanwhile, the cabinet ministers concluded a seven-hour meeting Tuesday afternoon during which the discussed the security escalation in southern Israel. ""The Cabinet discussed the events in the south and heard reports from the IDF and the security forces about the attacks and the widespread actions against the terrorist elements in Gaza. The cabinet instructed the IDF to continue operations as necessary.""

A political source said tonight that Hamas had approached Israel through four different intermediaries and asked for a ceasefire. Israel responded that the steps in the field would be determined on the basis of need and that Israel reserved freedom of action.

More than 400 rockets and mortar shells were launched at between 16:30 on Monday to Tuesday afternoon.

By 9:00 AM, 55 Israeli casualties were reported, including a 48-year-old man who was killed. Four people were seriously injured: a soldier wounded by shrapnel in the Sha'ar Hanegev section, two women aged 60 and 40, and a 40-year-old man.

A tweet from HBO didn’t offer much insight into the season beyond the release date as an associated teaser trailer from HBO is made up entirely of clips from previous seasons. The clips don’t seem to have a definitive theme, ranging from clips of Ned Stark in season one to battles that happened just last season and just about everything in between.

Other than the release month for the final season, it seems that the tweet is intended to remind fans that they can catch up on the previous six seasons on HBO Go and HBO Now. With the release of the final season just a few months away, HBO will likely release a full trailer with footage from the show’s final episodes soon.

'We need their brains': donating to the brain bank in search of a dementia cure,'We need their brains': donating to the brain bank in search of a dementia cure,1.0,"It’s a rainy Wednesday morning and Dr Andrew Affleck is driving more carefully than usual on his way to the Neuroscience Research Australia building in Randwick.

It’s not just the slick, crowded roads putting the edge on his caution; in the boot of his car, cocooned in several layers of protective container and nestled in ice, is the brain of a human being who was alive only a few hours earlier.

It’s no ordinary brain – if any brain could be said to be ordinary – but one that has a deadly secret buried inside. The individual who was until recently embodied within this mass of pink, grey and white tissue died of one of the neurodegenerative diseases that are increasingly a cause of death for our ageing population. Perhaps it was Alzheimer’s disease that gradually robbed them of their connection to reality, or frontotemporal dementia that transformed their personality, or Parkinson’s disease that shook their body and mind.

Dr Andrew Affleck, a research associate at the Sydney Brain Bank

Whatever claimed their life, this organ is on its way to the Sydney Brain Bank.

“I really hope that this is the brain that will get us across the line,” says Affleck. At the Sydney Brain Bank, housed within NeuRA, the hope is that scientists will be able to glean some new and vital insight from their tissue. And maybe, one day, that insight will lead to a better understanding, a better treatment, or even a cure.

“Every donation, bringing the tissue back into the laboratory, I say to myself, I really hope that this is the tipping point,” says Affleck, a research associate at the Sydney Brain Bank.

“That is really exciting, and gets you wanting to do the best you can; not only for science, but for the family themselves.”

Adele Lusson, research assistant, preparing paraffin embedded tissue sections for staining

The inside of the Sydney Brain Bank looks like a typical research facility: carpeted offices walled with glass, and laboratories where every available space is filled with equipment, glassware and folders, but everything is scrupulously clean and tidy. There are no brains in jars or any Hollywood-esque embellishments that might give a visitor any sense of the 600 or so brains – and some spinal cords – that have passed through the hands of the scientists here.

Several floors below the gleaming laboratories, in a basement that’s normally accessed via a goods lift, is a room about the size of a typical boardroom. It’s filled with mobile shelves that can be separated and moved with the touch of a button.

The shelves are lined with sealed white plastic buckets, each containing one half of a brain that has been preserved in formalin. Dr Claire Shepherd, director of the Sydney Brain Bank, is almost apologetic about it.

“The buckets don’t look very glamorous or scientific, but years of experience have told us that they’re the best vehicle to store the brains in,” she explains.

The room is temperature-controlled at a comfortable warmth, and is totally silent apart from a few electronic beeps as the powered shelves are moved apart. It’s a peaceful space; like being in a room full of deep sleepers.

The other halves of each of these preserved brains are stored upstairs in ultra-low freezers at -80 Celsius.

The Sydney Brain Bank is one of many such facilities around Australia and around the world whose purpose is to collect brain and spinal cord tissue from people afflicted with a variety of diseases and conditions. That tissue is made available to researchers searching for answers to the questions of why these diseases happen, how they progress, and what can be done to treat, halt or prevent them.

The Sydney Brain Bank’s focus is neurodegenerative diseases; in particular, the dementias and the movement disorders – such as Parkinson’s disease, motor neurone disease, Huntington’s disease and progressive supranuclear palsy.

Brain donation is a different beast to organ donation, not the least because one is for transplant while the other is for research.

“A lot of people just think that it’s on their organ donation card, and they ask me, ‘Can I donate my brain because I’m an organ donor?’” Shepherd says. But donating a brain is far more complex, because for scientists to get the most information from that donated tissue, they need to know about the donor’s life before they died.

The donors connected to the Sydney Brain Bank are recruited through a network of specialist neurologists and clinics around Sydney, who collect standardised data about their patients, such as their medical history and the unique history and features of their disease. This data includes blood tests and regular imaging with technology such as MRI.

“Then the value of the tissue is really enriched, because we not only have the tissue but we have all this information about what the individual looked like in life, and it’s standardised information on cohorts of individuals as well,” Shepherd says.

Andrew Affleck, removing tissue sections from the automated slide stainer.

However the donor’s personal identity and life are hidden from the staff and researchers who work with the tissue. It has to be that way, not just for privacy reasons, but also for the benefit of the staff who handle the donated brains.

Shepherd recalls the family member of a donor who had died, who sent the Bank a homemade booklet about the donor’s life and who they were. Seeing that snapshot of the donor’s life was an intensely emotional experience for Shepherd, and that emotion is still very close to the surface.

“I am the custodian of the brain tissue,” she says. “That doesn’t mean I’m insensitive to who that person is, obviously, but I don’t have that close relationship and it would be dangerous if I did I think, because it would affect me on this level every day.”

Time is the enemy of organ donation. The longer an organ – whether heart, kidney or brain – remains inside a body that is no longer supplying it with life-giving oxygen, the more the tissue breaks down and the poorer the quality of the information can be gleaned from it.

The Sydney Brain Bank staff carry pagers with them 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. When a donor dies, one of the first calls made by the family, carers or medical staff is to that paging service.

Things have to happen quickly. Whoever is on call then liaises with the mortuary where the body will be taken, and with the funeral service.

“One of the main things that we aim to do is to really not disrupt the funeral arrangements for the family … as best we can, we try and expedite the donation for them so that there’s no delay,” Affleck explains.

The removal of the brain – and spinal cord if that is also being donated – takes place at one of the few remaining operational mortuaries in Sydney. It’s a relatively quick process, a couple of hours at most, then Affleck or whoever is on call takes the tissue back to the Brain Bank.

Once it arrives, the brain is divided into two hemispheres. One half is frozen, along with tissue samples that are dissected from brain regions that are of particular interest to researchers. The frozen tissue can later be studied under the microscope, but more importantly, the freezing preserves the DNA, proteins and biochemistry of the tissue.

The other half of the brain is immersed in formalin for two weeks, which allows the liquid preservative to fully penetrate the brain. Once that process is complete, that hemisphere is stored in 3mm sections layered on fine sheets of acetate, in the white buckets that line the basement shelves. At this point the Brain Bank staff also take smaller samples, or “blocks”, from different parts of the brain that are of interest for further study.

“Maybe there’s softening or there’s tissue discolouration or there’s something that really does need further investigation under the microscope,” says Affleck. These smaller sections are also treated with a variety of stains that highlight the presence – or absence – of proteins and structures.

The final step is a complete, standardised report that ties together what the Brain Bank has observed about the tissue with what was known about the donor’s life and disease. That information is the starting point for researchers interested in studying the tissue. Perhaps, somewhere in these folders, boxes of slides, samples of tissue and pages of data, is the answer they’re seeking.

What about the donors and their families? What are they seeking when they tick that box and consent to their or their loved one’s most personal organ being removed after death?

Lucille Bloch had never heard of brain donation until she attended a lecture by Professor John Hodges, who heads up a research group at NeuRA.

Clockwise from top: Lucille Bloch; Keith Bloch; a black-and-white photo of Lucille and Keith Bloch

“He said dementia is growing in numbers, we have to think about creating a cure for dementia, and what we need are people with dementia, once they have passed away, we need their brains,” she recalls.

Lucille’s husband Keith had been diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia. After the lecture, she sat down with him and told him what she had learned.

“And he said, ‘Well, dear, we’ve got four children at the moment, and two grandchildren, I’m going to give my brain because I want to help, if our children get it and other people [get it].”

Keith died 10 years ago, but Lucille still occasionally visits NeuRA. “I’m part of it,” she says. The experience has made her an advocate for brain donation, and for a greater awareness and understanding of dementia. When her time comes, she will also donate her brain.

Lisa Webb’s husband Bob died around two years ago of what was diagnosed as primary progressive aphasia – a gradual loss of language abilities. However this was actually a symptom of Parkinson’s disease, a diagnosis that wasn’t revealed until after his death.

Fairly soon after Bob’s diagnosis, the subject of brain donation came up during a visit to NeuRA for tests.

“For him, the brain was just part of the body; he was always happy to donate organs and the brain was just another organ,” Lisa says. “I guess I have the same view; I looked at it and thought, if there’s anything we can do to help other people not have to go through this, then let’s do it.”

The thought that Bob’s tissue resides somewhere in the Sydney Brain Bank and is helping researchers gives her a sense of comfort.

India's sepsis babies: The struggle to save newborns from superbugs,India's sepsis babies: The struggle to save newborns from superbugs,1.0,"Baby Manu had been in the intensive care unit (ICU) in the Indian city of Jaipur for 10 days with a life-threatening bloodstream infection. Her mother was extremely anxious, unable to feed or hold her child.

As there was no window into the unit, she couldn’t even see her. Nobody was allowed into the ICU and Manu had to be cared for by one nurse, so the infection didn’t spread to other infants on the ward.

Manu was suffering from sepsis, a serious and potentially deadly condition where an infection gets into the bloodstream and the body overreacts.

If left untreated, babies can go into septic shock and their organs can begin to shut down within hours. Manu had already been given powerful “last resort” antibiotics for more than a week. Perplexingly, they didn’t seem to be working.

Laboratory tests came back revealing why. The infection that had spread to Manu’s blood was resistant to every antibiotic the hospital stocked, except for one: Polymyxin B. This explained why her infection hadn’t responded. Manu was given Polymyxin B immediately, but had to be monitored carefully as it can damage the kidneys and nerves.",https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/11/13/indias-sepsis-babies-struggle-save-newborns-superbugs/
Indonesian woman who lost fiance in Lion Air crash goes ahead with their planned wedding,Indonesian woman who lost fiance in Lion Air crash goes ahead with their planned wedding,1.0,"JAKARTA - An Indonesian woman who lost her fiance in last month's Lion Air plane crash near Jakarta went ahead with their planned wedding alone, to fulfil his last wish.

Hospital staffer Ms Intan Syari, 26, and Mr Rio Nanda Pratama, a medical doctor, had hired an event organiser named ""Adiela"" and decided on Nov 11 as their wedding day.

Rio, 26, was among the 189 people on board Lion Air Flight JT610 that crashed 13 minutes after take-off from Jakarta on Oct 29. The plane was bound for Pangkal Pinang. He was returning home after attending a conference in Jakarta.

It was Indonesia's worst aviation disaster since a Garuda Indonesia plane crashed in Medan in 1997, killing all 234 people on board.

Ms Intan wrote on her Instagram account @intansyariii that before leaving for Jakarta to attend the conference, Rio jokingly told her: ""If I don't return by Nov 11, go ahead wear your wedding dress that I chose for you, wear a beautiful make-up, ask for a fresh white rose from Ms Sheila (wedding organiser), and take good photos. Then send the photos to me.""

Photos of Ms Intan at the Nov 11 wedding, wearing a white wedding dress and a white hijab and holding white roses went viral on social media in Indonesia. One of the photos was Ms Intan showing her wedding ring to the camera.

""There is sadness that I cannot describe, but I have to smile for you. I shall not mourn. I have to stay strong like you always told me,"" Ms Intan added.

She also said in another posting with the picture of her and one of Rio's sisters: ""Although you are not beside me, your sister was with me to fulfil your most beautiful last wish. I know you are happy up there...""

Ms Intan disclosed her age and her late fiance's to The Straits Times, while confirming her posting on Instagram.

She told The Straits Times that Rio was a medical doctor at Bakti Timah hospital, in Pangkal Pinang, where she works in the finance department.

""He was a nice person and always wanted to help patients... He always reminded me... that in the world, nothing is eternal,"" Ms Intan said.",https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/indonesian-woman-who-lost-boyfriend-in-lion-air-crash-goes-ahead-with-wedding-as
New handheld devices will help gardaí identify uninsured drivers,New handheld devices will help gardaí identify uninsured drivers,1.0,"GARDAÍ WILL SOON be able to use handheld devices to check whether a vehicle is insured or not.

Insurance companies are currently providing insured and uninsured vehicle lists to the gardaí, according to the Seventh Progress Update report from the Cost of Insurance Working Group which provides detail of the plan.

These lists are based on vehicle licence plate number and insurer name, according to the report.

This new system will in turn link to a database of uninsured drivers which was recommended by the Government’s Cost of Insurance Working Group in January 2017.

The new handheld devices are currently being trialled and the first phase of the new plan to tackle uninsured drivers should be complete by the end of the year.

Speaking on RTÉ Radio 1 this afternoon, Conor Faughnan, Director of Consumer Affairs at AA Ireland, welcomed the establishment of the new database.

Scientists in Ireland find link between obesity and cancer,Scientists in Ireland find link between obesity and cancer,1.0,"Trinity College Dublin research has discovered that the body’s immune surveillance systems stutter and fail in the presence of excess fat, which reduces their ability to fight cancer and disease.

Scientists, at Trinity College Dublin, have made a major discovery that shines a new, explanatory light on the link between obesity and cancer. Their research confirms why the body’s immune surveillance systems – led by cancer-fighting Natural Killer cells – stutter and fail in the presence of excess fat. Additionally, it outlines possible paths to new treatment strategies that would see “fat-clogged” Natural Killer cells molecularly re-programmed and jolted back into action.

Over 1.9 billion adults are overweight and obese (over one-third of the adult population) and this places a huge health and economic burden on society because there are a large number of knock-on adverse health impacts to being obese, such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and a range of infections. Additionally, up to 50% of certain cancers are attributed to obesity.

Until now, however, little had been known about the impact obesity has on immune surveillance.

The research that changed that was led by Associate Professor in Immunology at Trinity College Dublin, Lydia Lynch, who also conducts research at Harvard Medical School, and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in the US. The research has just been published in leading international journal Nature Immunology.

Working with natural killer cells from humans, and mice as model organisms – the scientists first discovered that the molecular machinery of Natural Killer cells gets clogged up by excess fat in obese individuals. This clogging up does not prevent Natural Killer cells from recognizing tumor cells, but it does prevent them from killing them.

Further investigation then pinpointed the specific metabolic step that was stifled in the fat-clogged Natural Killer cells, and, offering promise for the development of treatments further down the line, the scientists were able to re-programme these cells and restore their cancer-fighting abilities by providing them with a metabolic jolt.

Professor Lynch said: “Despite increased public awareness, the prevalence of obesity and related diseases continue. Therefore, there is increased urgency to understand the pathways whereby obesity causes cancer and leads to other diseases, and to develop new strategies to prevent their progression.”

“Our results highlight immuno-metabolic pathways as a promising target to reverse immune defects in obesity and suggest that metabolic reprogramming of Natural Killer cells may kick-start their anti-cancer activity and improve treatment outcomes.”

"Single protein drives growth and spread of deadliest cancer, research shows","Single protein drives growth and spread of deadliest cancer, research shows",1.0,"Addiction to a single protein could hold the key to taming one of the world’s deadliest cancers, research suggests.

Scientists have discovered that a particularly aggressive sub-type of pancreatic cancer needs the molecule to grow and spread.

They are now looking at ways of suppressing the protein, TP63, to increase the survival chances of patients with the disease.

Pancreatic cancer, which affects almost 10,000 people each year in the UK, has a bad reputation as one of the most lethal cancers.

On average, a patient with pancreatic cancer will survive only about two years after diagnosis.

But some individuals with an especially aggressive sub-type of the disease often succumb even earlier, after less than a year.

US researchers investigating this super-deadly pancreatic cancer sub-type found that the gene for TP63 was uniquely active in its tumour cells.

Writing in the journal Cell Reports, they point out that the molecule does not belong in pancreas cells.

P63 normally plays a role in the production of squamous cells, long thin cells required for skin formation.

But in pancreatic tumours, the cancer version of the protein – TP63 – fuelled out-of-control growth and helped the disease spread around the body.

The good news was that the cancer seemed to depend on the molecule for its on-going survival, raising hopes of developing targeted treatments.

Lead scientist Dr Timothy Somerville, from Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory in New York, said: “The cancer cells become so reliant on P63 that they actually require P63 for their continued growth.

“So moving forward, we’re looking into approaches to suppress inappropriate P63 activity as a treatment option for patients.”

Another goal for the team is to discover why the gene becomes active in the pancreas in the first place.

“If we can stop it from ever happening, it could be really good for the survival of this most vulnerable group of cancer patients,” said Dr Somerville.",https://www.irishnews.com/magazine/science/2018/11/13/news/single-protein-drives-growth-and-spread-of-deadliest-cancer-research-shows-1484279/
Health Ministry to expand the range of medics working on ambulances,Health Ministry to expand the range of medics working on ambulances,1.0,"The Health Ministry will urgently draft amendments in order to expand the range of medics who can work at the Emergency Medical Service, Health Minister Anda Čakša (Greens and Farmers Union) told reporters after the government committee's meeting November 12.

The amendments to the Regulations Regarding Mandatory Requirements for Medical Treatment Institutions and Their Structural Units could be drawn up by the beginning of next week.

Problems in the Emergency Medical Service's Riga regional center have continued for several years, and that is the reason why Čakša had insisted on increasing salaries at the Emergency Medical Service, the minister said.

While the overall level of healthcare workers' salaries has increased 30%, salaries at the Emergency Medical Center have increased only 20%, said Čakša.

As reported, the Emergency Medical Service has decided to declare a state of medical emergency in its Riga region center due to a rapid outflow of medical staff.

The service’s director Liene Cipule told journalists on Friday that the service was experiencing a “mass outflow of medics” who are dissatisfied with excessive workload and meager wages, as well as an uncertainty about their wages in 2019.

In Cipule’s words, the resignation of 15 employees has already been accepted, but several other medics have also submitted resignation letters. The Emergency Medical Service’s administration intends to hold talks with these employees.

Sticking Tiny Needles in Your Eye May Help Fight Blindness,Sticking Tiny Needles in Your Eye May Help Fight Blindness,1.0,"An eye patch covered in tiny needles sounds like a torture device straight out of one of the Saw movies. In fact, it’s the invention of researchers in Singapore, who have been searching for a better way of treating eye diseases, such as glaucoma and macular degeneration.

Currently, these diseases are most commonly treated with eye drops. However, eye drops are not always sufficient to deliver large enough quantities of drugs. Nor are they particularly well-suited for delivering drug doses over an extended period of time. That’s where the somewhat squirm-inducing new treatment comes into play. It involves an eye patch studded with tiny dissolvable needles. The patch is placed onto the patient’s eye and then removed, leaving the microneedles embedded in their cornea. The microneedles consist of two layers: An outer layer which delivers an initial drug dose and an inner layer which delivers a secondary drug dose over the course of several days.

“This work provides a new strategy for efficient drug delivery into the eye,” Chen Peng, a professor in the School of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering at Nanyang Technological University, told Digital Trends. “With simple pressing of the eye patch on the eye, the detachable tiny needles can penetrate the ocular surface tissue, and serve as implanted micro-drug-reservoirs. The biphasic drug release kinetics enabled by the double-layered micro-reservoirs largely enhances the therapeutic efficacy.”

So far, the needle-studded eye patch has been tested on mice, where it demonstrated significantly more efficiency than regular eye drops. “Using corneal neovascularization as the disease model in mice, delivery of an anti-angiogenic monoclonal antibody by [the] eye patch can reduce 90 percent of neovascular area, which is much better than drug efficacy using eye drops, [which is around 15 percent,” Peng continued.

The researchers are currently optimizing the eye patch, focused predominantly on the microneedles’ composition and stiffness. This will enable better practical use. They are also in the process of searching for clinical collaborators for a medical trial, with the ultimate goal of commercializing the technology.

A paper describing the work, “Self-implantable double-layered micro-drug-reservoirs for efficient and controlled ocular drug delivery,” was recently published in the journal Nature Communications.

Amazon turtle populations recovering well thanks to local action,Amazon turtle populations recovering well thanks to local action,1.0,"Credit: University of East Anglia

The historically over-exploited Giant South American Turtle is making a significant comeback on river beaches in the Brazilian Amazon thanks to local protection efforts, say researchers at the University of East Anglia.

And not only have turtle populations benefited from conservation efforts, other co-occurring species have begun to thrive once again on the protected beaches and in surrounding areas.

The UEA team, working in partnership with Universidade Federal de Alagoas, Anglia Ruskin University and Universidade Federal do Amazonas, analysed data collected on Giant Turtle populations nesting on protected beaches along the Juruá, a major tributary of the Amazon river, over the past four decades.

They also surveyed both locally protected and unprotected beaches along a 1,000-km meandering section of the same river. The survey covered nests of all turtle species as well as bird, iguana, caiman, large fish, river dolphin and insect populations on either the river beaches or the adjacent river channel during the dry season.

Their results, published in Nature Sustainability, show that Giant Turtle populations are well on their way to full recovery on beaches guarded by local vigilantes. There are now over nine times more turtles hatching on these beaches than there were in 1977, equivalent to an annual increase of over 70,000 hatchlings.

The beach survey showed that, of over 2000 turtle nests monitored on protected beaches, only two per cent were attacked by poachers. In contrast, on unprotected beaches, poachers had harvested eggs from 99 per cent of the 202 nests surveyed.

Other species also had much larger populations on protected beaches, compared to beaches with no protection. Species benefiting from the conservation programme included migratory birds, such as the Black Skimmer, the Large-Billed Tern and the Sand-Coloured Nighthawk, as well as the Black Caiman, River Dolphins, Green Iguana and large catfishes.

Turtles have historically been an over-exploited source of meat and eggs despite the first protection laws banning turtle harvest coming into force in 1967. By the late 1970s, numbers had reached worryingly low levels.

The beach protection programme along the Juruá river is part of the largest community-based conservation programme in the Brazilian Amazon. Beaches are guarded on a shoestring budget by local communities carrying out round-the-clock beach surveillance throughout the five-month turtle breeding season.

Prof Carlos Peres, from UEA's School of Environmental Sciences and a senior author on the study, said: ""This study clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of empowering local management action by stakeholders who have the largest stake and a 24/7 presence at key conservation sites. The beaches protected by local communities represent noisy islands of high biodiversity, surrounded by lifeless unprotected beaches, which are invariably empty and silent.""

The team hopes their evidence will help convince governments that supporting local conservation is critical to successful ecological restoration programmes.

""Relying on a handful of government officials, who are often based in urban centres, to protect five million square-kilometres of Amazonian rivers and forests is at best a losing battle which so far has largely failed,"" said Prof Peres.

""We need to trigger and then subsidize powerful 'win-win' alliances with local communities to both ensure their welfare and sustain the collective vigilance that can maintain the integrity of the world's largest tropical wilderness region.""

Dr. Joseph Hawes, a collaborator at Anglia Ruskin University, said: ""Our research highlights the valuable conservation service currently provided by local communities, not just for turtles but for the wider ecosystem. Recognising the importance of their work shows the potential for effective conservation action, even outside existing formally protected areas.""

Lead author Dr. João Campos-Silva, now a postdoctoral researcher at Universidade Federal de Alagoas, Brazil, said: ""Currently, six million people in the Brazilian Amazon depend on wild nature. By including local dwellers in conservation practices, we can increase the effectiveness of conservation outcomes and enhance local welfare.

""We found huge differences between the ecological and social outcomes in this program. But there is widespread dissatisfaction voiced by beach guards, who get very little return for what can be dangerous work. This means that many of them are now on the brink of giving up on decades of successful beach protection. Better support for this activity through the development of an independent income stream would ensure the long-term financial viability of this program.""

Mrs May described the attack on 15-year-old Jamal at a Huddersfield school as ""absolutely terrible"" and said her thoughts were with him.

An online appeal set up to help the family topped £130,000 in 24 hours and football stars from Huddersfield Town invited the boy to be their guest at a Premier League game.

Asked about the incident during her visit to the G20 summit in Argentina, Mrs May said: ""I thought it was absolutely terrible ... what (he) went through. Our thoughts are with him.

""But I think if you look at what happened, the real spirit of Britain came in the response of the British people to that incident.

""As you say, most people were sickened and angered by it. The huge response of support ... that we have seen from the British people shows our true spirit and shows we are a welcoming people.""

Jamal has thanked supporters and met a group of around 30 concerned people outside Almondbury Community School on Thursday.

The teenager told supporters ""thanks for everything"" before leaving with his father. The group held an hour-long meeting with headteacher Trevor Bowen to address concerns.

Imam Mohammed Pandor, one of those among the group, said the meeting was ""very productive"".

He said: ""Clearly when someone comes from Syria, fleeing Assad's regime, coming to a place like this, when you get treated that way, that's an issue. And the whole world is looking at us.

""We can't accept this type of behaviour whether the victim is Muslim or non-Muslim. It really doesn't matter.""

Footage of the attack - in which Jamal is thrown to the ground by his neck, kicked and has water poured over his face as he is threatened with drowning - was widely shared online.

Outrage over the assault saw an online appeal set up to help his family, which raised more than £130,000 in 24 hours.

In an ITV interview the boy said he did not feel safe at school and has been left traumatised and frightened by the attack.

He said: ""I woke up at night and just started crying about this problem. They think I'm different - different from them.

""I don't feel safe at school. Sometimes I say to my dad, 'I don't want to go to school anymore'. I was just crying and I didn't do nothing because I respect the school rules.""

The boy's sister was also filmed being attacked on Tuesday, in a video that showed other students attempting to pull her hijab off.

Both teenagers have said they will no longer attend the school in Huddersfield and have said they are looking into what to do next.

But they said they are concerned over threats on social media towards the boy who allegedly assaulted Jamal, saying: ""I don't want anything terrible to happen to him at all. I just don't want anything bad to happen to anyone.""

A 16-year-old boy has been interviewed over the attack, and reported for summons for an offence of assault ahead of a youth court appearance.

West Yorkshire Police said another ""unconnected"" incident took place on 7 October in which Jamal was left with a wrist injury.

"NYU suicide survivor, 26, received most the sophisticated face transplant ever","NYU suicide survivor, 26, received most the sophisticated face transplant ever",1.0,"Doctors have revealed how they carried out the most technologically advanced face transplant ever on a 26-year-old man who survived a suicide attempt - and the meteorological obstacles they had to overcome to make it happen.

Cameron 'Cam' Underwood was 24 when he took a gun, held it under his chin, and pulled the trigger at home alone in Yuba, California on June 26, 2016.

He woke up in hospital with no face except for a forehead, eyeballs and tongue - and he couldn't believe what he was told. He had battled depression for years, and he had once pithily said to his parents that he'd considered suicide, but he didn't think he would truly try to take his own life.

But there he was, waking up from five weeks of heavy sedation, alive against all the odds but with no face - unable to eat and talk, struggling to breathe, and ashamed to see anyone without wearing a mask.

However, months later, his mother heard about Dr Eduardo Rodriguez of NYU Langone Health who is one of a handful of doctors pioneering face transplants in the US. They got in touch, Cam was accepted, and in January 2018 a donor became available.

Today at a press conference in New York City, Dr Rodriguez revealed Cam's was the most sophisticated face transplant ever performed, with the shortest time between injury and operation, despite traveling further than any other patient in history, 2,800 miles across the US.

Cameron 'Cam' Underwood and Dr Eduardo Rodriguez on Thursday, just 11 months after his operation. The pair have built a strong bond over the past 18 months as Cam's life turned around and Dr Rodriguez performed the most technologically advanced face transplant ever

Cam Underwood, now 26, lost the vast majority of his face after shooting himself in the face in a 2016 suicide attempt (left). Today, he is the recipient of the most sophisticated face transplant to-date, detailed at a New York University event (right)

Cam pictured skydiving within months of his surgery. Dr Rodriguez joked: 'I can at least check off the box that a face transplant can tolerate jumping 15,000 out of the air – and it all held together! I think this photo shows Cam is living and doing the things he loves.'

It was almost derailed by an arctic storm - 'the bomb cyclone' which hit the US in January 2018. Thanks to 'the generosity' of certain pilots, Cam managed to get on one of the only flights permitted from California to New York that day so he could undergo the groundbreaking operation.

But it was a success, and his recovery has been faster than any other case - to the extent that, within just a few months, he's even been skydiving.

Sharing the photo, Dr Rodriguez joked: 'I can at least check off the box that a face transplant can tolerate jumping 15,000 out of the air – and it all held together! I think this photo shows Cam is living and doing the things he loves.'

Speaking publicly for the first time, Cam told reporters: 'Even though I'm still recovering and gaining back some sensation and mobility, I'm so happy with the results. I have a nose and a mouth again, so I'm able to smile, speak, and eat solid foods. I also don't get as many stares or questions from strangers.'

Transformation: Cam Underwood was 24 when he tried to take his own life with a shotgun while drunk in June 2016 - and he later could not believe he'd done such a thing. He lost everything below his eyes but surgeons managed to patch him up (left). On January 5, 2018, he was admitted for a face transplant (pictured, center, shortly after; pictured, right, recently)

The use of 3-D computer surgical planning, 3-D printed patient-specific cutting guides, intraoperative navigation, and intraoperative CAT scan ensured that facial bones were aligned perfectly and that implantable plates and screws used to anchor the grafted face to Underwood were in an ideal position

HOW WAS THE FACE TRANSPLANT DONE? The team at New York University Langone Medical Center worked in two adjoining rooms throughout the 25-hour surgery. The team carried out the following transplants: Maxillary (upper jaw) and mandibular (lower jaw) bones, including all 32 teeth and gums

Palate (roof of the mouth) and floor of the mouth (excluding the tongue, although Underwood's tongue required some reconstruction)

Lower eyelids and cheeks (Underwood's upper eyelids were preserved)

Nose and sections of the nasal passage During recovery, Underwood had to undergo rehabilitative therapy. This included: physical therapy geared toward building strength

swallowing and speech therapy

'For all of us it's really remarkable to be part of this,' Dr Rodriguez said.

'A mother who cried every day, finally her prayers were answered. And his father too, they finally get to see their child whole again.'

NYU Langone Health is the only center in New York State that can perform face transplants, having now performed three, and it's one of just a few in the country.

They were put on the map in August 2015, when Dr Rodriguez operated on Patrick Hardison, who was severely burned while working as a volunteer firefighter in Mississippi in September 2001. His ears and eyelids were burned off, and he had to have more than 70 surgeries to treat his injury.

Hardison's is still the most extensive face transplant that had ever been done.

But Cam's broke new ground.

Technologically, it was groundbreaking: they used 3D printing to create the pre-surgical structure and align his bones in surgery. It was also the first time anyone has used a personalized 3D printed mask - rather than a silicone mold - to help shape the patient's face post-transplant.

'When we first met Cameron, we were confident we could improve his appearance and, more importantly, his function and quality of life,' Rodriguez added.

'Advances in medical technology allow us to more rapidly evaluate donors and recipients for face transplant, and to perform surgery more safely and efficiently. But, in the end, it's all about the patient. Cameron has put in the work and has made the necessary commitments.'

It was the shortest time period ever between injury and face transplant - just 18 months. And despite the extent of Cam's injuries, which took 25 hours to repair, his was the shortest recovery, too.

The fact that he went just 18 months between his injury and his transplant - shorter than any other face transplant patient - is a huge boost for his recovery, Dr Rodriguez said.

'Cameron has not lived with his injury for a decade or longer like most other face transplant recipients have,' he says. 'As a result, he has not had to deal with many of the long-term psycho-social issues which often lead to issues like severe depression, substance abuse, and other potentially harmful behaviors.'

It was also a financially groundbreaking: insurance covered a significant amount of the surgery, rather than research grants, which paid for all previous face transplants.

'This is yet another watershed moment in the advancement of face transplantation,' says G. Leslie Bernstein, administrator for the Face Transplant Program at NYU Langone Health and the principal negotiator with Underwood's private insurer. 'Securing coverage for Cameron's medical care, for both his face transplant and his continuing aftercare, illustrates how this field is moving closer toward an accepted standard of care.'

CAM'S STATEMENT Good morning. And thank you for coming today – I'm excited to be here with you. I think it's important to share my story to help inspire others to have hope and seek help. I am so grateful to have received a face transplant, which has given me a second chance. Even though I'm still recovering and gaining back some sensation and mobility, I'm so happy with the results. I have a nose and a mouth again, so I'm able to smile, speak, and eat solid foods. I also don't get as many stares or questions from strangers. I've been able to get back to many of the activities I love, like being outdoors, playing sports, and spending time with my family. I hope to get back to work soon, too, and someday start a family. Here with me today are my amazing mom and dad, along with my brothers and sister, and other members of my family. They've been with me every step of the way. Mom, Dad, Julie, Aaron, and Brad, thank you for not giving up on me. It hasn't been easy, but it's been worth it. I especially want to thank Live On New York and Will and Sally Fisher – my donor and his mom. I want Sally and her family to know how much my family and I appreciate their gift and that I will always honor Will's legacy. I also want to thank Dr. Rodriguez and his amazing team at NYU Langone Health. All of the other doctors, nurses, therapists, staff, as well as the assistance we've received from myFace, have been incredible. Everyone has been just amazing. In closing, I'd just like to say that there have been so many amazing advances in transplant surgery. I'm living proof of that. But it only happens because of caring people like Will Fisher and his family. Thank you. Advertisement

WHAT HAPPENED TO CAM?

Cam was a welder from Yuba City in Northern California, a small agricultural area north of Sacramento.

He was athletic, hard-working, and a thrifty saver.

As soon as he graduated high school, he got a job working for his stepfather, and by 19 he got a mortgage on a house.

The next few years were rocky, though.

He and his high school sweetheart separated after years together, and he lost touch with one of his closest friends, which seemed to hit hard.

One of his brothers (he is the youngest of four, with two brothers and a sister) moved away, and he was soon diagnosed with depression.

He started to drink a lot, and recoiled from any of his relatives' attempts to get him to ease off.

'At a very young age he decided to become independent,' Dr Rodriguez said.

'No one would ever know that there was anything wrong with Cameron at all but he was suffering with a little bit of depression. Often many of us suffer from these bouts and feel that we can overcome it.'

On June 26, 2016, he spent the day hitting the bottle - something that had become commonplace.

But that night he entered a vortex that sucked him further than before, and he thought he should end his life.

He pointed a shotgun under his chin and pulled the trigger, obliterating his entire face.

'His life as he knew it would forever be changed,' Dr Rodriguez said.

And his family's.

'Here they are at the hospital not knowing if he was ever going to live, sustained brain injury if he's ever going to see again.

His mother lived in a trailer in the parking lot of the hospital and spends 160 days with him.

'Amazing family by his side every minute of every day,' Dr Rodriguez said.

Cam was discharged in February and was home in Yuba for the Easter holiday.

He is still on a strict regimen of anti-rejection medications, and will be for the rest of his life to prevent a rejection episode.

'We are thrilled that Cameron is responding so well to the transplant,' said Bruce E. Gelb, MD, a transplant surgeon at NYU Langone.

'Our team has established a successful, novel, patient-donor matching protocol and immune suppression regimen that we believe provides the best outcomes for our patients because the risk of rejection and toxicity is greatly minimized.'

Underwood remains positive and focused on his new life and is grateful to his donor and the Fisher family for what they have done for him.

'Will and his family made an incredible sacrifice to give back to me what had been lost,' he says. 'I will never forget that. I'm also eternally grateful to Dr. Rodriguez and his face transplant team. My family and I could not have made this journey without them. We hope my experience inspires others who have severe facial injuries to have hope, as I was inspired by others who came before me. The journey hasn't been easy, but it's been well worth it.'

Randy Underwood, Cam's father, said Cam has always been strong, with determination and tenacity, and he is sure Cam is going to come through this ordeal

HOW DOCTORS SAVED HIS LIFE

Cam was found by his uncle Lonnie, who'd received a text from Cam asking him to come over and spend the night.

Lonnie went round straight away.

'I got to his house and all the lights were on, which I expected,' Lonnie said. 'Door was unlocked, I walked in... nobody in the living room.'

Once he reached the bedroom he discovered blood everywhere and Cam struggling - very much alive and staggering around.

Lonnie says he 'went into a state of shock' and called 911.

Cam was airlifted to University of California Davis Medical Center, where doctors got to work.

After numerous surgeries he was stabilized, but his face was gone.

'They told us he had … no teeth, no chin, no cheekbones, no facial structure… nothing,' his father Randy Underwood told ABC.

'It really wasn't a face... it was pretty horrific,' his brother Aaron Underwood added.

At first he was in a medically-induced coma, then very heavily drugged for just over a month.

Finally, in August 2016, he was lucid enough to understand what had happened, and to see his face for the first time.

'When I woke up, I didn't know what was going on, where I was, what had happened to me,' he said - adding, painfully: 'I was shocked that I would actually do something like that, and that I had survived.'

Cam stayed in the hospital until December 2016. Once he was discharged, he wore a mask all the time.

FINDING A FACE TRANSPLANT UNIT - AND A DONOR

Shortly after he was discharged, his mother Bev heard that surgeons at NYU Langone had performed a face transplant on a former firefighter, Patrick Hardison, who was maimed by a burning roof that fell on him.

Donor: Will Fisher, 23, was a writer, filmmaker, chess player who studied at Johns Hopkins University. He was described by family as wise beyond his years. He died suddenly in January 2018 after a battle with mental illness

She got in touch, and in March 2017 Dr Eduardo Rodriguez took him on, starting the lengthy procedure to get Cam enrolled, including physical screening, psychiatric screening and counseling, and getting him on the transplant list.

Finally, in January this year, he got the bitter-sweet call all transplant hopefuls yearn for: they had a candidate.

Will Fisher, 23, had died in New York City, and he was a registered organ donor with LiveOnNY - one of the few New Yorkers to sign up (New York has the lowest proportion of registered organ donors in the country, with fewer than 25 percent signed up).

His mother Sally was consulted as doctors found he would be able to transform multiple lives with his heart, liver, kidneys, and eyes.

To donate his face, though, the surgeons need more than for him to be signed up to the organ donor registry. That required a conversation with his mother.

Sally agreed.

Will, described by his family as wise beyond his years, was just a bit younger than Cam when he died. He had the same skin tone, skull size, hair color, a full set of teeth and the same blood type.

As soon as he received the call, Cam flew directly to New York from California and that night he underwent the 25-hour surgery that changed his life.

A team of 100 doctors worked through the night to connect the muscles, tissues and blood vessels.

'Often people think it's just like putting on a mask... it's not that simple,' Dr Rodriguez told ABC. 'The face needs to fit like a puzzle - and that's a tricky thing because we hit the point of no return.'

POST-SURGERY: REBUILDING HIS LIFE AND MEETING HIS DONOR'S MOTHER

A face transplant is a life-threatening procedure, and it's not clear how long one can live after the surgery (as far as Dr Rodriguez knows, it may be capped at 10 years).

Cam says he knew all of that but he never saw it as a choice - it was his only option to reclaim his life.

As soon as he saw himself after the procedure, he remembers thinking: 'Wow... that was breathtaking. And I was just blown away, relieved... and excited all at the same time.'

He still battles depression, but he has therapy and takes medication. '[I]t's not a daily fight anymore... but yeah, there are still days when I am depressed,' he said.

When he first woke up in the hospital, he never expected that today, two years later, he would be eating, chatting, feeling confident - thanks to a face transplant, and the incredible heart of Sally Fisher, who agreed to let her son, Will, be a face donor after he died suddenly at the age of 23 following a battle with mental illness.

For Will's mother Sally, Cam is the one thing that helped her worked through her grief

And last month, Sally and Cam met for the first time, filmed by ABC's 20/20, with Sally weeping in disbelief as she embraces Cam, and Cam describing the small, unexpected joys of regaining a face.

'I'm so glad you're here,' Fisher said to Underwood as the two hugged. 'I'm so glad.'

Cam's mother Bev Bailey-Potter - who was the one that found the face transplant unit - gasped saying, 'Oh, Sally. Oh, my goodness, you're the courageous one and giving my son the chance to be normal again. I mean, he looks so fantastic.'

Sally turned to Cam and added: 'I know, you look beautiful. I guess I'm a little biased. I think you're drop-dead gorgeous.'

Cam, now 26, said learning to use his mouth teeth and lips is 'just like a baby learning to talk.'

'I can smile, I'm working on closing my lips all the way, they don't close all the way... but they're getting there,' he said. 'They're a lot better than they were.'

Above all, he relishes 'being able to actually eat.'

'Just to let it sit in your mouth and taste it,' he said. 'All those little things that we take for granted that you know, you miss and you want back.'

Dr Rodriguez said it was an honor to work with Cam and to meet his tight-knit family

Speaking to Sally he said he was 'very grateful'.

He said he hopes sharing his story will deter others from trying to take their lives - or to seek help if they experienced a similar situation.

'I just want people to know that it can happen, you know? That if you're in the same kind of situation that I was in… there's people out there that can help you and will. You just have to reach out,' he said.

His goal now is 'that I can get back to work... and you know, eventually I want a family and kids... you know, the American dream.'

For Will's mother Sally, Cam is the one thing that helped her worked through her grief.

She told People: 'I don't think I would have survived Will's death if it wasn't for Cameron. Cameron's got his whole life ahead of him — and I love the idea that Willie's helping him have a better life.'

Vegetarian cannabis restaurant 'to redress outdated stereotypes',Vegetarian cannabis restaurant 'to redress outdated stereotypes',1.0,"The team behind an eatery dubbed Britain's first vegan and vegetarian cannabis restaurant say their aim is to ""redress outdated stereotypes"" about the drug.

The menu features food and drinks infused with legal and non-psychoactive organic cannabinoid products containing the compounds CBD, CBG and CBN.

The team describes cannabis as a ""versatile and powerful herb, packed full of flavour and fragrance, with a whole range of natural therapeutic benefits"".

They were inspired by research claiming the plant can boost appetite, tackle pain, and help with digestive problems and reproduction issues as well as stress and memory loss.

Founder Sam Evolution wants Canna Kitchen in Brighton to ""educate society"" and said it will open customers' eyes so they experience the plant in new forms and don't just see it as a recreational drug.

The restaurant, which opens to the public on Saturday, will focus on healthy food made from organic local produce.

Mr Evolution said: ""Our mission is to spark a larger conversation around cannabis, to assist in educating and re-informing society's perceptions of the plant.

""The Canna Kitchen aims to achieve this by offering people an opportunity to experience the plant in a form that may be new to them.""

Head chef Charlotte Kjaer is experimenting with dishes including Zaa'tar roasted cauliflower, hemp heart tabbouleh, smoked aubergine, sesame Cavolo Nero and buckwheat and beetroot pancakes served with refreshments like non-alcoholic hash beer.

She said: ""I enjoy to cook with the seasons and in harmony with nature, a diet rich in seasonal plant-based food is not only nutritious for the body, but also beneficial for the planet.

""I aim to create honest, balanced and vibrant food.""

Mr Evolution said there has been overwhelming support with many people ""keen to see the plant receive the acknowledgement it truly deserves"".

But there had also been criticism from some who ""seem to struggle with separating outdated definitions of the plant"", he said.

He is confident his restaurant is the first of its kind, adding: ""I researched heavily into any other legal restaurant establishments in the UK, and aside from a pop up in 2015, I could find no other projects of this nature.""

Other venues experimenting in this area include a coffee shop in Swansea which opened earlier this year, reportedly offering customers the chance to add shots of cannabis oil to drinks.

Intriguing New Discovery on Hair Loss in Wounded Skin Could Lead Us to New Treatments,Intriguing New Discovery on Hair Loss in Wounded Skin Could Lead Us to New Treatments,1.0,"Scientists think they've found one of the main reasons hair doesn't grow back on wounded skin, based on tests on mice – and their research could help develop better hair loss treatments in the future.

The key is apparently the sonic hedgehog signalling pathway and the proteins its genes encode: named for the spiky appearance of its molecules, this pathway is very active in the womb when hair follicles are being formed, but is noticeably less busy in damaged skin in healthy adults.

By stimulating communication along the pathway in fibroblast cells – the ones that release the collagen protein that gives skin and hair its shape and strength – the researchers were able to grow hair on wounded skin in mice with a few weeks... and that's a big deal.

""Our results show that stimulating fibroblasts through the sonic hedgehog pathway can trigger hair growth not previously seen in wound healing,"" says one of the team, cell biologist Mayumi Ito from NYU Langone Health.

If we can get the right skin cells as chatty as they are in their embryonic form, we could eventually get hair growing back on skin damaged by scars and burns, as well as helping restore hair growth in people who've gone bald.

That's still some way off – this research has so far worked in mice – but we now have a better understanding of the biological processes happening behind the scenes, when scarring and collagen buildup is happening naturally in a wound.

The hope is that the scarring process might eventually be adapted to trigger hair regrowth by changing some of the signals sent between cells.

In the past, reactivating the sonic hedgehog pathway has led to problems with tumour growths, so to guard against this the team concentrated on fibroblasts (known to promote healing), and only those fibroblasts just beneath the skin's surface.

This is where the hair follicle roots or dermal papillae first appear, so in some ways it's like setting up base camp for renewed hair growth. You won't be able to go out and buy a magical baldness cure in the near future, but we're getting a little closer.

It's a problem that's being tackled from multiple angles too: earlier this year research showed that hair follicle regrowth could be triggered by certain smells too, setting off a chemical reaction to stimulate the reappearance of hairs.

Meanwhile, last year another team of scientists identified a protein responsible for controlling hair growth and regeneration; like this new study, the experiments only covered mouse models.

However, mice are a pretty good - although not perfect - substitute for humans in studies such as this one.

What we do know is the sonic hedgehog gene is responsible not just for hair follicles but also for limb and organ growth in the womb, so it's a fundamental part of how our body develops.

The next step for the researchers is to find genetic or chemical triggers that could help activate the gene again when it's been knocked out of commission.

""Now we know that it's a signalling issue in cells that are very active as we develop in the womb, but less so in mature skin cells as we age,"" says Ito.

Brilliant iron molecule could provide cheaper solar energy,Brilliant iron molecule could provide cheaper solar energy,1.0,"The new iron molecule. Credit: Nils Rosemann

For the first time, researchers have succeeded in creating an iron molecule that can function both as a photocatalyst to produce fuel and in solar cells to produce electricity. The results indicate that the iron molecule could replace the more expensive and rarer metals used today.

Some photocatalysts and solar cells are based on a technology that involves molecules containing metals, known as metal complexes. The task of the metal complexes in this context is to absorb solar rays and utilise their energy. The metals in these molecules pose a major problem, however, as they are rare and expensive metals, such as the noble metals ruthenium, osmium and iridium.

""Our results now show that by using advanced molecule design, it is possible to replace the rare metals with iron, which is common in the Earth's crust and therefore cheap,"" says Chemistry Professor Kenneth Wärnmark of Lund University in Sweden.

Together with colleagues, Kenneth Wärnmark has for a long time worked to find alternatives to the expensive metals. The researchers focused on iron which, with its six per cent prevalence in the Earth's crust, is significantly easier to source. The researchers have produced their own iron-based molecules whose potential for use in solar energy applications has been proven in previous studies.

In this new study, the researchers have moved one step further and developed a new iron-based molecule with the ability to capture and utilise the energy of solar light for a sufficiently long time for it to react with another molecule. The new iron molecule also has the ability to glow long enough to enable researchers to see iron-based light with the naked eye at room temperature for the first time.

""The good result depends on the fact that we have optimised the molecular structure around the iron atom,"" explains colleague Petter Persson of Lund University.

The study is now published in the journal Science. According to the researchers, the iron molecule in question could be used in new types of photocatalysts for the production of solar fuel, either as hydrogen through water splitting or as methanol from carbon dioxide. Furthermore, the new findings open up other potential areas of application for iron molecules, e.g. as materials in light diodes (LEDs).

What surprised the Lund researchers is that they arrived at good results so quickly. In just over five years, they succeeded in making iron interesting for photochemical applications, with properties largely as good as those of the best noble metals.

""We believed it would take at least ten years,"" says Kenneth Wärnmark.

Incredibly accurate atomic clocks may detect faint signals from dark matter,Incredibly accurate atomic clocks may detect faint signals from dark matter,1.0,"Incredibly accurate atomic clocks may detect faint signals from dark matter

Atomic clocks are nothing new, these timepieces have been around for many years. Scientists working on experimental atomic clocks at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have reported three new performance records for their clocks. The team says that the clocks have improved accuracy enough that not only are they going to improve timekeeping and navigation, but they may be sensitive enough to detect faint signals from gravity, the early universe, and dark matter.

Each of the new atomic clocks traps a thousand ytterbium atoms in grids that are made of laser beams. The atoms tick by switching between two energy levels. The researchers can compare the two independent clocks allowing them to improve systematic uncertainty, stability, and reproducibility.

Systematic uncertainty is how well the clock can represent the natural vibrations of the atoms captured in the laser lattice. The team found the clock had a possible error of one billionth of a billionth from the natural ticking frequency of the atoms. Stability is how much the clock frequency changes over time, in this case, it changes 0.00000000000000000032 during a day. Reproducibility is how close the two clocks tick at the same frequency, the frequency difference was less than one billionth of a billionth in this test.

The ytterbium atomic clocks exceed the conventional capability to measure the shape of the Earth (geodetic measurement) based on tidal gauge surveys of sea level. Researchers say that a comparison of these clocks located far apart, on different continents, could provide geodetic measurements within 1 centimeter, better than the current several centimeters.

Some of the improvements to the new clock include thermal and electric shielding that surrounds atoms to protect them from stray electric fields. Ytterbium atoms are one of the potential candidates to be used in the future redefinition of the second. Scientists are currently redefining all sorts of measurements, including a recent redefinition of how to describe a kilogram.",https://www.slashgear.com/incredibly-accurate-atomic-clocks-may-detect-faint-signals-from-dark-matter-29556306/
Scientists find a way to enhance the performance of quantum computers,Scientists find a way to enhance the performance of quantum computers,1.0,"Credit: CC0 Public Domain

USC scientists have demonstrated a theoretical method to enhance the performance of quantum computers, an important step to scale a technology with potential to solve some of society's biggest challenges.

The method addresses a weakness that bedevils performance of the next-generation computers by suppressing erroneous calculations while increasing fidelity of results, a critical step before the machines can outperform classic computers as intended. Called ""dynamical decoupling,"" it worked on two quantum computers, proved easier and more reliable than other remedies and could be accessed via the cloud, which is a first for dynamical decoupling.

The technique administers staccato bursts of tiny, focused energy pulses to offset ambient disturbances that muck sensitive computations. The researchers report they were able to sustain a quantum state up to three times longer than would otherwise occur in an uncontrolled state.

""This is a step forward,"" said Daniel Lidar, professor of electrical engineering, chemistry and physics at USC and director of the USC Center for Quantum Information Science and Technology (CQIST). ""Without error suppression, there's no way quantum computing can overtake classical computing.""

The results were published today in the journal Physical Review Letters. Lidar is the Viterbi Professor of Engineering at USC and corresponding author of the study; he led a team of researchers at CQIST, which is a collaboration between the USC Viterbi School of Engineering and the USC Dornsife School of Letters, Arts and Sciences. IBM and Bay Area startup Rigetti Computing provided cloud access to their quantum computers.

Quantum computers are fast, but fragile

Quantum computers have the potential to render obsolete today's super computers and propel breakthroughs in medicine, finance and defense capabilities. They harness the speed and behavior of atoms, which function radically different than silicon computer chips, to perform seemingly impossible calculations.

Quantum computing has the potential to optimize new drug therapies, models for climate change and designs for new machines. They can achieve faster delivery of products, lower costs for manufactured goods and more efficient transportation. They are powered by qubits, the subatomic workhorses and building blocks of quantum computing.

But qubits are as temperamental as high-performance race cars. They are fast and hi-tech, but prone to error and need stability to sustain computations. When they don't operate correctly, they produce poor results, which limits their capabilities relative to traditional computers. Scientists worldwide have yet to achieve a ""quantum advantage—the point where a quantum computer outperforms a conventional computer on any task.

The problem is ""noise,"" a catch-all descriptor for perturbations such as sound, temperature and vibration. It can destabilize qubits, which creates ""decoherence,"" an upset that disrupts the duration of the quantum state, which reduces time a quantum computer can perform a task while achieving accurate results.

""Noise and decoherence have a large impact and ruin computations, and a quantum computer with too much noise is useless,"" Lidar explained. ""But if you can knock down the problems associated with noise, then you start to approach the point where quantum computers become more useful than classic computers.""

USC research spans multiple quantum computing platforms

USC is the only university in the world with a quantum computer; its 1098-qubit D-Wave quantum annealer specializes in solving optimization problems. Part of the USC-Lockheed Martin Center for Quantum Computing, it's located at USC's Information Sciences Institute. However, the latest research findings were achieved not on the D-Wave machine, but on smaller scale, general-purpose quantum computers: IBM's 16-qubit QX5 and Rigetti's 19-qubit Acorn.

To achieve dynamical decoupling (DD), the researchers bathed the superconducting qubits with tightly focused, timed pulses of minute electromagnetic energy. By manipulating the pulses, scientists were able to envelop the qubits in a microenvironment, sequestered—or decoupled—from surrounding ambient noise, thus perpetuating a quantum state.

""We tried a simple mechanism to reduce error in the machines that turned out to be effective,"" said Bibek Pokharel, an electrical engineering doctoral student at USC Viterbi and first author of the study.

The time sequences for the experiments were exceedingly small with up to 200 pulses spanning up to 600 nanoseconds. One-billionth of a second, or a nanosecond, is how long it takes for light to travel one foot.

For the IBM quantum computers, final fidelity improved threefold, from 28.9 percent to 88.4 percent. For the Rigetti quantum computer, final fidelity improvement was a more modest 17 percent, from 59.8 to 77.1, according to the study. The scientists tested how long fidelity improvement could be sustained and found that more pulses always improved matters for the Rigetti computer, while there was a limit of about 100 pulses for the IBM computer.

Overall, the findings show the DD method works better than other quantum error correction methods that have been attempted so far, Lidar said.

""To the best of our knowledge,"" the researchers wrote, ""this amounts to the first unequivocal demonstration of successful decoherence mitigation in cloud-based superconducting qubit platforms ... we expect that the lessons drawn will have wide applicability.""

High stakes in the race for quantum supremacy

The quest for quantum computing supremacy is a geopolitical priority for Europe, China, Canada, Australia and the United States. Advantage gained by acquiring the first computer that renders all other computers obsolete would be enormous and bestow economic, military and public health advantages to the winner.

Congress is considering two new bills to establish the United States as a leader in quantum computing. In September, the House of Representatives passed the National Quantum Initiative Act to allocate $1.3 billion in five years to spur research and development. It would create a National Quantum Coordination Office in the White House to supervise research nationwide. A separate bill, the Quantum Computing Research Act by Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., directs the Department of Defense to lead a quantum computing effort.

""Quantum computing is the next technological frontier that will change the world and we cannot afford to fall behind,"" Harris said in prepared remarks. ""It could create jobs for the next generation, cure diseases and above all else make our nation stronger and safer. ... Without adequate research and coordination in quantum computing, we risk falling behind our global competition in the cyberspace race, which leaves us vulnerable to attacks from our adversaries,"" she said.

Researchers report two new approaches to producing three-dimensional (3-D) images using X-rays that could improve disease-screening, study of very fast processes and enable analysis of the properties of materials and structural information of opaque objects with unprecedented detail.

The researchers describe their approaches to 3-D imaging with X-rays in two papers in Optica, The Optical Society's journal for high-impact research. One method might reduce X-ray doses needed in some types of preventative medical imaging, such as breast-cancer screening. The other method might allow 3-D imaging of delicate biological samples or the study of very fast processes, such as the types of interactions that occur during space-debris impacts, to speed development of more durable materials.

Because of their high energy and short wavelength, X-rays can pass through materials that visible light cannot. Although it is possible to obtain 3-D X-ray images, current approaches are limited in application because they require prolonged exposures to damaging X-rays.

In humans, too much radiation from medical X-ray imaging can increase cancer risk, which limits how often they can be screened with 3-D mammography and other 3-D X-ray technologies. Very high-energy X-rays used to study the detailed make-up of materials and biological samples often cannot be used because the samples would be destroyed after one exposure.

3-D ghost tomography with X-rays

Researchers led by Andrew Kingston of the Australian National University together with a team at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in France have demonstrated for the first time that the unconventional imaging approach known as ghost imaging can be used to obtain 3-D X-ray images of the interior of objects opaque to visible light.

""Because of the potential for significantly lower doses of X-rays with 3-D ghost imaging, this approach could revolutionize medical imaging by making X-ray screening for early signs of disease much cheaper, more readily available and able to be undertaken much more often,"" said the paper's senior author, David Paganin, from Monash University, Australia. ""This would greatly improve early detection of diseases including cancers.""

Ghost imaging works by correlating two beams—in this case, X-ray beams—that do not individually carry any meaningful information about the object. One beam encodes a random pattern that acts as a reference and never directly probes the sample. The other beam passes through the sample.

The researchers created random X-ray patterns by shining a bright beam of X-ray light through a metal foam, which is like a sponge made of metal. They took a 2-D image of this random beam, and then passed a very weak copy of it through the sample. A large-area single-pixel detector captured X-rays that passed through the sample. The process was repeated for multiple illuminating patterns and sample-object orientations to construct a 3-D tomographic image of the object's internal structure.

As a proof-of-concept experiment, the researchers carried out ghost X-ray tomography on an aluminum cylinder with a diameter of 5.6 millimeters and containing two holes of less than 2.0 millimeters diameter. They were able to produce 3-D images with 1.4 million ""voxels""—a term for 3-D pixels—with a resolution, or voxel side-length, of 48 millionths of a meter.

""X-ray ghost imaging, especially ghost tomography, is a completely new field that needs to be explored and developed much further,"" said Kingston. ""With more development, we envision ghost X-ray tomography as a route to cheaper and, therefore, much more readily available 3-D X-ray imaging machines for medical imaging, industrial imaging, security screening and surveillance.""

3-D images from a single exposure

A research team from the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland, led by Marco Stampanoni, together with a team from the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY) in Germany and the ESRF, acquired 3-D images using high-brilliance X-ray sources. Their new approach uses a single exposure, or shot, to obtain 3-D information from X-rays one hundred billion times brighter than a hospital X-ray source. The rays can only be produced at specialized synchrotron facilities.

""High-brilliance X-ray sources are quite useful for biology and materials science because they can probe faster processes and higher resolutions than other X-ray sources,"" said the paper's first author Pablo Villanueva-Perez from DESY. ""Because the power of these sources can destroy the sample after a single pulse, current 3-D imaging using the full power of these sources requires multiple identical copies of a sample.""

The new technique can make the measurements necessary to form a 3-D image before destroying the sample, so it could be useful for studying the mechanics of delicate biological samples such as living insects or examining the internal 3-D structure of intact viruses or proteins.

The new single-shot approach uses a crystal to split one incoming X-ray beam into nine beams that simultaneously illuminate the sample. Using detectors oriented to record information from each beam allows researchers to acquire at once nine different 2-D projections of a sample object before it is destroyed by the intense X-ray probe beams.

The researchers used the approach to image a moth, which demonstrated the potential for studying insect mechanics with 3-D microscale resolution at speeds ranging from microseconds to femtoseconds. They also showed that they could achieve nanoscale resolution by imaging a gold nanostructure.

""We would like to combine our technique with the unique capabilities of the European X-Ray Free-Electron Laser Facility, the first facility to deliver X-ray pulses at a rate of one million pulses per second,"" said Villanueva-Perez. ""This could allow 3-D exploration of fast processes at speeds of millions of frames per second.""

The researchers plan to use their single-shot multi-projection imaging technique to better understand insect biomechanics, which could inspire new engineering setups. They also want to study new, lighter materials that might lower fuel consumption for vehicles and plan to examine the fast processes that occur when space debris hits satellites, which could aid development of protective materials.

"Scientists, ethicists slam decisions behind gene-edited twins","Scientists, ethicists slam decisions behind gene-edited twins",1.0,"As more details regarding the first gene-edited humans are released, things continue to look worse. The researcher who claimed the advance, He Jiankui, has now given a public talk that includes many details on the changes made at the DNA level. The details make a couple of things clear: we don't know whether the editing will protect the two children from HIV infections, and we can't tell whether any areas of the genome have been damaged by the procedure.

All of that raises even further questions as to whether He followed ethical guidelines when performing the work and getting consent from the parents. And, more generally, nobody is sure why He chose to ignore a strong consensus that the procedure wasn't yet ready for use in humans. In response to the outcry, the Chinese government has shut down all further research by He, even as it was revealed that a third gene-edited baby may be on the way.

While the US already has rules in place that are intended to keep research like He's from happening, a legal scholar Ars spoke with suggested there may be a loophole that could allow something similar here. In light of that, it's important to understand the big picture He has potentially altered. What exactly happened in China and why does it concern so many in the scientific community?

Technical failures

Prior to this work, a strong consensus existed among the scientific community that, although technology for editing the human genome was available, we didn't know enough yet about how to check its safety and effectiveness to determine how to ethically use it. And, as it turns out, He's work appears to provide a demonstration of nearly everything that had the research community concerned.

(Researchers at the conference where He spoke provided a transcript of his talk and shared his slides; other details have come out via data he's shared with the AP.)

The goal of the editing was to damage the CCR5 gene, which encodes a protein that HIV uses to enter cells during infection. He and his colleagues used a gene-editing technique that is expected to generate small deletions. They targeted one of these deletions to a spot in the center of the gene that's the site of a mutation that blocks HIV infection. The data shared so far indicates they were successful in terms of generating deletions, but whether or not they inactivated the gene is far less clear.

When a gene is translated into a protein, its DNA is read using a code where three of the bases in DNA encode one of the amino acids in a protein. This makes a gene very sensitive to whether deletions eliminate a number of bases that's a multiple of three. If a deletion takes out six or nine bases, for example, the resulting protein will only be missing two or three amino acids, respectively. Thus, it may be able to function normally. If the deletion doesn't remove a multiple of three—if it takes out 11 or 16 bases, for example—then the rest of the gene after the deletion won't be read properly. You'd end up switching to the protein equivalent of random keyboard bashing, often stopping the protein very short.

In the case of one of the twins born, the deletion eliminates 15 base pairs, meaning the CCR5 protein will lack five amino acids but otherwise be normal. In the second twin, some of her cells will have a four base pair deletion, which will cause a short tail of 10 random amino acids. Other cells will actually have an extra base, which also results in a randomization of the amino acids that follow, although the tail is much longer in this case.

The key thing for the twins' health and safety is that we have no idea whether any of these proteins will be made and placed on the cell surface as normal and, if they are, whether HIV can interact with them. All of these things can be tested, but He has given no indication of whether those tests have been done. So we have no idea of whether the edited genes will accomplish the intended goal of blocking HIV infection, and, worse still, it's not clear whether He's team knows.



Quantifying risk (or not)

The fact that one of the two twins has different deletions also points to another worrisome aspect to this work: not every cell in the embryo was edited at the same time and in the same manner, even though the editing machinery was injected when the embryo was a single cell. The resulting embryos could be a mosaic of unedited cells and cells with different types of damage to the intended gene. In fact, we now know that one of the twins also has some cells where one copy of the gene wasn't edited at all, meaning this twin has thus taken on the risks of gene editing without the supposed benefit of HIV protection.

Advertisement

This also means we don't know which of these changes (if any) will be inherited by any kids the twins have.

The risk of gene editing is that the process sometimes leads to what are called ""off target"" effects: deletions elsewhere in the genome or more complex rearrangements of the DNA. Either of these could potentially damage or alter genes that are not the intended targets of the editing, which would have unpredictable effects on health. To check for these, He allowed the edited embryos to develop to the point where it was safe to remove several cells; the DNA from these cells was then sequenced and the sequence compared to that of the two parents.

Unfortunately, the techniques that allow sequencing from extremely small samples like this are relatively inefficient. As a result, He was only able to obtain 80-90 percent of the genomes of the edited embryos. If there was damage in the remaining percentage, He didn't know. And because of the mosaic nature of the embryos, it's not even clear whether the DNA sequences He obtained were representative of the remainder of the embryo.

In the information that was obtained, however, there was one indication of off-target damage. Yet because it wasn't in the immediate vicinity of a gene, He decided that it was acceptable to proceed, even though the damage could influence gene activity or chromosome structure.

In sum, the data available so far indicates that we do not know whether the editing will actually protect either of the twins from HIV infection, the ostensible goal of the work. And as we noted in our original coverage, there are other, less drastic ways of preventing HIV infections and treatments available if those fail. Even if gene editing were used, it could be used on the blood stem cells that reside in the bone marrow, rather than on an embryo.

At the same time, this procedure exposed the twins to risks that we can't fully catalog and don't currently understand. As University of Wisconsin bioethicist Alta Charo said, “Having listened to Dr. He, I can only conclude that this was misguided, premature, unnecessary, and largely useless.”

Pilar Ossorio, a bioethics scholar at the University of Wisconsin's Morgridge Institute, echoed her concerns. ""He created the risk that these children will suffer from something that they need not have ever suffered from,"" she told Ars. ""And we will not get good scientific information out of that.""",https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/11/gene-edited-babies-unknown-risks-and-clear-ethical-failures/
Singapore to ban discharge of 'wash water' at top ship refuelling port,Singapore to ban discharge of 'wash water' at top ship refuelling port,1.0,"SINGAPORE: The Maritime Port Authority (MPA) said on Friday (Nov 30) that it is banning with effect from Jan 1, 2020, the discharge of ""wash water"" used in ships to scrub engine exhaust.

The ban on so-called open-loop scrubbers in Singapore, home to the world's top ship refuelling or bunkering hub, is a potential setback to shippers that have invested millions in the exhaust gas cleaning systems.

The move is to help prepare one of the world's busiest ports for new International Maritime Organisation (IMO) rules that come into force in 2020 and oblige ships to use cleaner fuels.

""To protect the marine environment and ensure that the port waters are clean, the discharge of wash water from open-loop exhaust gas scrubbers in Singapore port waters will be prohibited,"" said Andrew Tan, Chief Executive Officer of the MPA during an event in Singapore.

""Ships fitted with hybrid scrubbers will be required to switch to the closed-loop mode of operation,"" Tan said, adding that Singapore will be providing facilities for the collection of residue generated from the operation of scrubbers.

The MPA said separately that the ban ""is already part of our current legislation"" but that its enforcement would start from Jan 1, 2020.

The IMO, the United Nations shipping agency, shook the fuels and maritime industries in 2016, when it said it would ban ships from using fuels with sulphur content above 0.5 per cent from Jan 1, 2020, compared with 3.5 per cent now.

To comply with the new rules, shippers can switch to burning costlier but cleaner fuels like marine gasoil or low-sulphur fuel oil, shift to alternative fuels like liquefied natural gas, or invest in exhaust gas cleaning systems, known as scrubbers.

Open-loop scrubbers use seawater as a scrubbing liquid and the waste stream is treated before being discharged back into the sea. In closed-loop systems, scrubbing is performed using water treated with additives and the liquid is recycled back into the scrubber. Hybrid scrubbers are a combination of both.

A spate of scrubber installation orders this year has led energy researchers to raise their demand forecasts for high-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) bunkers as the scrubbers will let the ships continue to burn HSFO once the IMO's sulphur regulations go into effect.

A switch to low-sulphur fuels is still widely seen by industry observers and participants as the most practical form of compliance, however, given the high investment and operational costs associated with scrubbers and uncertainty around future emissions regulations.

"LTA expands contactless payment trial for public transport to Visa, Nets cardholders","LTA expands contactless payment trial for public transport to Visa, Nets cardholders",1.0,"SINGAPORE - Visa and Nets cardholders can soon pay for their train and bus rides using their contactless bank cards, with the expansion of a pilot by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) to begin next month.

The LTA, Nets and Visa said in a joint statement on Friday (Nov 30) that the account-based ticketing (ABT) system has seen a successful pilot run with Mastercard since March last year.

Commuters are charged for their public transport rides in their credit or debit card bill, similar to contactless transactions made at retail merchants.

The expansion to include Visa and Nets card holders will allow them to improve the inter-operability of these cards before the LTA introduces the system to all commuters with contactless bank cards, the statement said.

LTA chief executive Ngien Hoon Ping said: ""I am confident that the Visa and Nets trials will be equally helpful in fine-tuning the ABT system before we launch it to the public in future.""

Commuters with Nets contactless bank cards with DBS/POSB, OCBC and United Overseas Bank (UOB) who are interested in joining the pilot can register at www.nets.com.sg/netsintransit from next Monday.

Visa will be inviting a group of employees and participants from various banks to take part in the pilot.

The participating banks include Bank of China, Citibank, CIMB, DBS, HSBC, ICBC, Maybank, OCBC, Standard Chartered and UOB.

Participants will be informed by Visa or their respective banks to register on the TransitLink ABT Portal or mobile app from next Monday.

Mr Kunal Chatterjee, Visa's country manager for Singapore and Brunei, said that a recent transit study by Visa found that nearly seven in 10 Singaporeans agree that the top benefit of using contactless payment is the convenience it brings.

They added that they no longer need to use cash or top up their stored value cards to pay for their rides.

The LTA, in an update on the Mastercard pilot, said more than 100,000 commuters have made 26 million trips using the ABT system since March 2017. This is an average of over 50,000 trips daily.

One of the pilot users, Ms Adeline Goh, said: ""Nowadays, I simply tap my Mastercard at the fare gates, and there is no need to top-up or worry about insufficient balance in my travel card, especially since I have to take a bus to the MRT station to top-up.

""It is also very convenient for me to check my transactions and track my transport expenditure on the TransitLink ABT Portal.""

Hope for male 'pill' breakthrough after huge cash injection,Hope for male 'pill' breakthrough after huge cash injection,1.0,"Researchers at a Scottish university hope to make a breakthrough in the long hunt for a male pill, thanks to a grant of more than $900,000 that will allow them to screen thousands of existing drugs to see if they have potential.

The money comes from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has been crusading on family planning for many years, with initiatives to help more women in developing countries access the contraception they want to control the size of their family.

It is now investing in research into a male pill, after global studies showing men in many countries would be willing to use it – if there were one.

Researchers at Dundee University have been given $929,585 (£728,311) over two years for work at their National Phenotypic Screening Centre. They are seeking existing drugs or chemical compounds that can interfere with certain sperm behaviours (phenotypes) essential for fertility.

Dr Paul Andrews, the director of operations, said: “Firstly, their ability to swim up the female reproductive tract and, secondly, a cellular process in the head of the sperm which must happen for the cell to progress towards the egg. Our screening efforts so far have shown such drugs exist.”

News of the grant was revealed as a team in the US announced a trial of a more traditional approach – a hormonal gel. Men at three sites will use a gel that is absorbed through the skin on their upper arms and shoulders, containing the progestin hormone used for female contraception, and testosterone.

As early as the 1640s, there was a male contraceptive made out of animal intestines, which came with Latin instructions to wash in warm milk to avoid infections.

Though today’s condoms look a little different and are more widely available, the basic sperm-blocking concept is the same and it is the only reversible method of male contraception – unless you count withdrawal. The hunt for a male contraceptive pill has been going on without success since the 1950s, when the female pill was invented.

Apart from condoms, said Chris Barratt, a professor of reproductive medicine at Dundee’s School of Medicine, “the reality is we have vasectomy which is irreversible but there is nothing else for men”.

The traditional approach has been to try hormones and steroids to stop sperm production. But so far these have not worked well and there are side-effects, from weight gain to acne. “People have been more optimistic than they should have been and it has dominated the funding,” he said.

The constant disappointments have led to fewer attempts to find an answer. “The research that has been done on male contraception you could write on a postage stamp,” said Barratt.

Though there has long been the question of men’s willingness to use a contraceptive pill – and women’s willingness to trust them to use it – Barratt insisted attitudes had changed.

“People are moving away from feeling reproductive health is basically the woman’s problem,” he said. “Research from the World Health Organization has shown if there was a reversible male contraceptive pill available, men would take it.”

Andrews said their approach was novel in looking at the behaviour of sperm in infertile patients, who may have sperm that do not move or can swim but not penetrate the egg.

“There are profound defects that make them not move or there are defects in the head of the sperm,” he said. “We’re trying to find drugs to target and immobilise the sperm and stop it getting into the egg.

“We’re sort of learning from the genetic defects out there. Unfortunately there’s not a lot known about the genetic causes of infertility. We’re taking a leaf out of nature’s playbook.”

The team will screen whatever drugs and compounds they can find that they think may interfere with the behaviour of sperm, such as a library of 13,000 compounds funded by Gates at the University of California, which has been a source for potential drugs against neglected tropical diseases. If they find nothing in California, their technology can screen “a plethora of other libraries”, Barratt said.

“I think at the end of two years we will have very good information if there are drugs currently on the market or in the pipeline that could be tweaked for contraception. If there are drugs, that will be fantastic.”

Meanwhile, a trial has begun in nine centres around the world – including Los Angeles, Seattle, Manchester and Edinburgh – of a gel that men can apply to their body, enabling hormones that will prevent sperm production.

It follows the trial of two injections every eight weeks, commissioned by the World Health Organization, which was successful at preventing pregnancies – but was halted in 2016 because the side-effects caused too many men to drop out. The problems included severe acne and mood swings.

This time, Dr Christina Chung-Lun Wang of the Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute, who is leading the trial sponsored by the National Institute of Child Health, and co-led by the Population Council in the US, is hopeful men will be more comfortable with the gel.

Researchers will ask participants to complete questionnaires about their well-being before and after the trial. “The men’s sexual function must be maintained,” she said. “And last time, we were not tracking the mood swings prospectively.”

The man must spread 5ml of gel on his skin. “He puts it on both upper arms and shoulders. It dries quickly. But the instructions are that after application, he should not be in close skin contact with any other person,” she said.

The gel could be rubbed off on to someone else. He should shower a few hours afterwards and then he can have contact with family, partner or children. Or he can wear a T-shirt.”

They hope to have some answers in about a year. Researchers were working on a pill, she said, but it was currently not possible to get the required dose of testosterone into a single daily tablet. The challenges to a male contraceptive remain but the quest goes on.",https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/nov/30/search-male-contraceptive-pill-bill-melinda-gates-foundation-funding-dundee-university

"This Is How Turmeric Helps People With Heart Ailments, Study","This Is How Turmeric Helps People With Heart Ailments, Study",1.0,"Turmeric - may repair exercise intolerance faced by patients with heart failure

There are a plethora of things that one can do to maintain a healthy heart free from diseases, which includes maintaining a healthy weight, morning walks, yoga sessions, and paying close attention to diet, caloric and food intake. These simple measures can help you have a positive effect on your heart. There is a list of certain foods that one must include in their diet to ensure smooth and healthy functioning of their heart, and one of the foods from that list is turmeric. The ancient Indian spice is gaining quite some attention across the world and there are reasons aplenty. Why turmeric, you ask? It is because of the presence of curcumin in turmeric. Turmeric is one of the most ancient spices hailing from Indian subcontinent. According to the study published in the Journal of Applied Physiology, curcumin - the active compound in turmeric - may repair exercise intolerance faced by patients with heart failure. People with heart failure have a reduced function of the left ventricle - the chamber of the heart that pumps blood out to the rest of the body - called reduced ejection fraction. This is linked to decreased ability to exercise.

Also Read:7 Health Benefits Of Turmeric (Haldi)

The findings showed that curcumin treatment improved muscle function and exercise capacity in mice with heart failure. Curcumin, a chemical that comes from the turmeric plant, has been used as a traditional Asian medicine for centuries, primarily to treat gastrointestinal ailments and skin wounds. Researchers from the University of Nebraska in the US, theorised that a reduction in the normal signalling of a protein Nrf2 may play a role in the impaired expression of antioxidant enzymes. The antioxidant enzymes both prevent and repair damage from oxidative stress as well as improve exercise performance.

For the study, the team gave one group of mice with heart failure daily doses of curcumin, which is known to promote activation of Nrf2, for 12 weeks, while another group did not receive treatment. The results showed that the expression of Nrf2 increased and levels of antioxidant enzymes improved in the animals with heart failure that were given curcumin. In addition, both groups that received curcumin - even the animals without heart failure - had improved exercise capacity when compared with the untreated groups.

""This data suggests that activation of Nrf2 in skeletal muscle may represent a novel therapeutic strategy to improve ... quality of life"" in people with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, the researchers noted.

GENEVA, Nov. 30 (Xinhua) -- With the coming of World AIDS Day 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNAIDS on Friday recommended self-tests to reach the 9.4 million people worldwide living with HIV who are unaware of their conditions.

As Saturday marks the 30th anniversary of World AIDS Day, which was first initiated by the WHO in 1988, the WHO said about 75 percent of the people estimated to be living with HIV, or 28 million out of 37 million, had accessed HIV testing and been diagnosed.

However, as this year's theme of the AIDS day ""Know Your Status"" suggests, important testing gaps still remain, which the WHO and partners recommend the use of self-tests as an additional tool to overcome.

The WHO first recommended HIV self-testing in December 2016. Today, more than 59 countries have policies on self-testing, with 28 of countries fully implementing the policies.

Meanwhile, a latest UNAIDS report shows that 9.4 million people living with HIV do not know they are living with the virus and urgently need to be linked to HIV testing and treatment services.

The report reveals that although the number of people living with HIV who are virally suppressed has risen by around 10 percentage points in the past three years, reaching 47 percent in 2017, some 19.4 million people living with HIV still do not have a suppressed viral load.

To remain healthy and to prevent transmission, the virus needs to be suppressed to undetectable or very low levels through sustained antiretroviral therapy. And to effectively monitor viral load, people living with HIV need access to viral load testing every 12 months.

The report outlines that access to viral load testing is mixed. In some parts of the world, getting a viral load test is easy and is fully integrated into a person's HIV treatment regime, but in other places there may be only one viral load machine for the entire country.

""Viral load testing is the gold standard in HIV treatment monitoring,"" said UNAIDS Executive Director Michel Sidibe. ""It shows that treatment is working, keeping people alive and well and keeping the virus firmly under control.""

UNAIDS has said that one of the biggest barriers to HIV testing is stigma and discrimination. Studies among women, men, young people and key populations have revealed that fear of being seen accessing HIV services, and if the person is diagnosed, fear that this information will be shared with family, friends, sexual partners or the wider community, was preventing them from accessing HIV services, including HIV testing.

In addition to self-testing, UNAIDS also recommends a variety of testing options and services, such as community-based testing and home-based testing, which can help mitigate many of the logistical, structural and social barriers to HIV testing.",http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-12/01/c_137642733.htm
This company is making cheap condoms for Nigeria and other African countries,This company is making cheap condoms for Nigeria and other African countries,1.0,"This implies that there are about 23.8 million infected persons on the continent. This is why a popular company is introducing cheap condoms for Nigeria, South Africa, Botswana and other African countries.

Bloomberg reports that Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc's Durex is making a new condom label named Feels, which started selling in November 2018.

Manufactured in South Africa, it is priced a lot less than other products. Durex's Featherlite, for instance, goes for 39.99 Rand (N1,057) per pack while the new product is sold at 9.99 Rand (N264) per pack of three.

In an interview in Johannesburg, Chief Executive Officer Rakesh Kapoor further explained the need for Feels.

He said that the company also intends to use the new product to normalize the conversation about condom use in Africa.

""This special pack is priced for this market, with the same quality you would expect from any of our other brands,"" Kapoor said.

Cohen told the judge he lied about the timing of the negotiations and other details to be consistent with Trump’s “political message.” Cohen and prosecutors referred to Trump as “individual one” throughout today’s proceedings and said he lied “to be loyal to Individual One.”

Among other lies, Cohen said he told Congress that all discussions about building a Trump Tower in Moscow had ended by January 2016, when they had actually continued until June of that year.

He said he also lied about his contacts with Russian officials and lied when he said he never agreed to travel to Russia in connection with the project and never considered asking Trump to travel to support the project.

Prosecutors said in a court complaint that Cohen had misled Congress to give a false impression that the Moscow project had ended before the Iowa caucus and first Republican presidential primary in 2016.

As he left the White House shortly after the court proceeding concluded, Trump called Cohen “a weak person”

“Michael Cohen is lying and he’s trying to get a reduced sentence,” Trump said.

Nothing said in court, or in associated court filings, addressed whether Trump or his aides had directed Cohen to mislead Congress.

The charges were brought by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the presidential election, not the prosecutors in New York who handled Cohen’s previous guilty plea in August to other federal charges involving his taxi businesses, bank fraud and his campaign work for Trump

Cohen’s lawyer, Guy Petrillo, said he would give the court a letter outlining how his client has cooperated with Mueller’s investigation.

Cohen declined to comment as he left the courthouse.

Reacting to the plea to the new charges, House Speaker Paul Ryan said Cohen “should be prosecuted to the extent of the law. That’s why we put people under oath.”

Cohen gave a statement to congressional committees last year saying the president’s company pursued a project in Moscow during the Republican primary but that the plan was abandoned “for a variety of business reasons.”

Cohen also said he sent an email to the spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin as part of the potential deal.

In his statement, he said that he worked on the real estate proposal with Felix Sater, a Russia-born associate who he said claimed to have deep connections in Moscow.

The discussions about the potential development began after Trump had declared his candidacy. Cohen had said the talks ended when he determined that the project was not feasible.

Cohen had also disclosed that Trump was personally aware of the deal, signing a letter of intent and discussing it with Cohen on two other occasions.",https://www.thejournal.ie/michael-cohen-pleads-guilty-4367114-Nov2018/
Stimulating One Brain Area May Ease Tough-to-Treat Depression,Stimulating One Brain Area May Ease Tough-to-Treat Depression,1.0,"FRIDAY, Nov. 30, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Electrical stimulation of a certain part of the brain may offer a new option for ""treatment-resistant"" depression, a small new study suggests.

Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, found that 25 patients with moderate-to-severe depression gained significant improvement in their mood after electrical stimulation of a brain region called the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC).

After just three minutes of electrical stimulation to the OFC, even on just one side of the brain, ""patients said things like 'Wow, I feel better,' 'I feel less anxious,' 'I feel calm, cool and collected,'"" UCSF postdoctoral researcher Kristin Sellers said in a university news release.

""You could see the improvements in patients' body language,"" she added. ""They smiled, they sat up straighter, they started to speak more quickly and naturally.""

The OFC is a small area of the lower surface of the brain, located just above the eyes. It's exact function remains unclear, but study senior author Dr. Eddie Chang explained that the OFC ""is richly connected to various brain structures linked to mood, depression and decision making, making it very well positioned to coordinate activity between emotion and cognition.""

Reporting Nov. 29 in Current Biology, the UCSF researchers suggested that the targeted therapy might help patients with treatment-resistant depression, which affects as many as 30 percent of depression patients.

One neurosurgeon who wasn't involved in the study said brain stimulation therapy for depression isn't new -- and the field has had some setbacks.

""Brain stimulation to treat other conditions (such as Parkinson's disease) has been known for decades to have an effect on the mind,"" noted Dr. Michael Schulder. He directs neurosurgery at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y.

""Several studies over the last 15 years, in which depressed patients had implanted brain stimulators, initially showed great promise,"" he said. In the final analysis, however, outcomes were not much better than would have been obtained with medication or psychotherapy.

But could those attempts have been targeting the wrong brain area? Chang's team wanted to find out.

Their new study involved 25 patients already enrolled in UCSF's epilepsy clinic. Chang specializes in neurosurgery for people with the seizure disorder. He explained that as a routine part of these surgeries, patients get electrodes temporarily implanted in their brains to help guide the surgery.

But in these 25 patients with depression, Chang's group used feedback from the electrodes to track brain activity over several days. They then linked that information to patients' changing moods, thereby pinpointing brain areas that might be amenable to stimulation therapy.

That led the investigators to the OFC, among other brain areas. The researchers would deliver a mild electrical current to brain regions and then ask the patients about their emotional state.

Stimulation to the OFC was the clear ""winner"" here, in terms of a mood boost. What's more, stimulating that area seemed to initiate a larger response within the brain, similar to what happens naturally when a person is feeling positive.

Also, the therapy seemed to only help patients with moderate-to-severe depression, not those with milder forms of the illness.

According to study team member Dr. Vikram Rao, this suggests that ""stimulation was helping patients with serious depression experience something like a naturally positive mood state, rather than artificially boosting mood in everyone.""

Rao, a UCSF Health neurologist, explained in the news release that prior research had suggested that OFC activity was ""elevated"" in people with depression, so the stimulation might alter the OFC in a healthy way.

Despite these promising results, the study authors said further research in larger groups of patients is needed to determine whether this therapy produces long-lasting benefits.

Dr. Vladan Novakovic directs outpatient psychiatry at Staten Island University Hospital in New York City. He agreed that most work in electrical brain stimulation has focused on a part of the brain's cortex, while leaving other areas, such as the OFC, unexplored.

Novakovic said the new study is ""commendable for providing real-time, clinically relevant information about the state of OFC and improvement in mood.""

For their part, the UCSF team believes that an improved understanding of the OFC's role in depression could lead the way to individualized treatment.

Heather Dawes, who helped to oversee the research, said, ""The more we understand about depression at this level of brain circuitry, the more options we may have for offering patients effective treatments with a low risk of side effects. Perhaps by understanding how these emotion circuits go wrong in the first place, we can even one day help the brain 'unlearn' depression.""

John Allen Chau, 26, was on a mission to introduce Christianity to the most isolated Stone Age tribe on Earth. Source: Facebook

John Allen Chau, 26, was on a mission to introduce Christianity to the most isolated tribe on earth.

But police believe he died on November 16 in a deadly bow and arrow attack by tribesman desperate to keep him off their remote North Sentinel home off the coast of India.

Fishermen who took Chau to the island say they saw tribespeople ‘dragging and burying his body’ on the morning of November 17.

Chau’s close friend and fellow missionary John Middleton Ramsey said he believes there is still a chance his friend may have survived the attack as his body has not been found.

“I think there’s a possibility he may have survived - I wouldn’t rule it out,"" he told The Sun.

“His mother is a Christian too and she has said that in her prayers that she had feelings that John might still be alive.”

He says authorities shouldn’t rule it out and points out the fishermen are the only source being cited in the reports.

“There weren’t a whole lot of eyewitnesses and so since his body hasn’t been found we shouldn’t rule it out - even if it is a small chance.”

Authorities have been trying to recover his body and believe they know where it is buried but their attempts have been thwarted by the armed tribesman, according to The Sun.

The Sentinelese have been known to attack anyone who goes to the island, seeing them as a threat.

John says if Chau is dead he wouldn’t want anyone to risk their life to bring his body home.

“Knowing John, I don't think it would be that important for him to be buried back at home,” he said.

“So if it was to endanger other people, I think he'd prefer being buried there.”

The young missionary hoped to spend time living with the Sentinelese people, learning their language, converting them to Christianity and even translating the Bible for them.",https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/world/friends-believe-missionary-shot-dead-bows-and-arrows-remote-indian-island-could-still-alive
National Museum of Brazil,First skull was from a woman who lived about 12.5k years ago destroyed by the fire..,0.0,"Museum in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

The Historical appearance of the initial building and surroundings

The National Museum of Brazil (Portuguese: Museu Nacional) was Brazil's oldest scientific institution.[3][4] It is located in the city of Rio de Janeiro, where it is installed in the Paço de São Cristóvão (Saint Christopher's Palace), which is inside the Quinta da Boa Vista. The main building was originally the residence of the Portuguese Royal Family between 1808 and 1821 and was later used to house the Brazilian Imperial Family between 1822 and 1889. After the monarchy was deposed, it hosted the Republican Constituent Assembly from 1889 to 1891 before being assigned to the use of the museum in 1892. The building was listed as Brazilian National Heritage in 1938[5] and was largely destroyed by a fire in 2018.

Founded by King João VI of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves on 6 June 1818, under the name of ""Royal Museum"", the institution was initially housed at the Campo de Santana park, where it exhibited the collections incorporated from the former House of Natural History, popularly known as Casa dos Pássaros (""House of the Birds""), created in 1784 by the Viceroy of Brazil, Luís de Vasconcelos e Sousa, 4th Count of Figueiró [pt], as well as collections of mineralogy and zoology. The museum foundation was intended to address the interests of promoting the socioeconomic development of the country by the diffusion of education, culture, and science. In the 19th century, the institution was already established as the most important South American museum of its type. In 1946, it was incorporated into the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.[6][5][7]

The National Museum held a vast collection with more than 20 million objects, one of the largest collections of natural history and anthropological artifacts in the world, encompassing some of the most important material records regarding natural science and anthropology in Brazil, as well as numerous items that came from other regions of the world and were produced by several cultures and ancient civilizations. Built-up over more than two centuries through expeditions, excavations, acquisitions, donations and exchanges, the collection was subdivided into seven main nuclei: geology, paleontology, botany, zoology, biological anthropology, archaeology, and ethnology. The collection was the principal basis for the research conducted by the academic departments of the museum – which are responsible for carrying out activities in all the regions of the Brazilian territory and several places of the world, including the Antarctic continent. The museum holds one of the largest scientific libraries of Brazil, with over 470,000 volumes and 2,400 rare works.[5]

In the area of education, the museum offers specializations, extension and post-graduation courses in several fields of the knowledge, in addition to hosting temporary and permanent exhibitions and educational activities open to the general public.[5] The museum manages the Horto Botânico (Botanical Garden), adjacent to the Paço de São Cristóvão, as well as an advanced campus in the city of Santa Teresa, in Espírito Santo – the Santa Lúcia Biological Station, jointly managed with the Museum of Biology Prof. Mello Leitão. A third site, located in the city of Saquarema, is used as a support and logistics center for field activities. Finally, the museum is also dedicated to editorial production, outstanding in that field the Archivos do Museu Nacional, the oldest scientific journal of Brazil,[8] continuously published since 1876.[6][9]

The palace, which housed a large part of the collection, was destroyed in a fire on the night of 2 September 2018.[10][11][12] The building had been called a ""firetrap"" by critics, who argued the fire was predictable and could have been prevented.[13] The fire began in the air-conditioning system of the auditorium on the ground floor. One of the three devices did not have external grounding, there was no individual circuit breaker for each of them, and a wire was without insulation in contact with metal.[14] In the wake of the fire, the ruined edifice was being treated as an archaeological site and undergoing reconstruction efforts, with a metallic roof covering a 5,000 m² area including debris.[15]

In 2019, more than 30,000 pieces of the Imperial Family's past were found during archaeological works on Rio de Janeiro Zoological Garden nearby, part of Quinta da Boa Vista. Among the finds are many items such as fragments of crockery, cups, plates, cutlery, horseshoes and even buttons and brooches with imperial coat of arms from military clothing. Those items were given to the museum.[16] After being destroyed by fire, the National Museum has received donations to the amount of R$ 1.1 million in seven months towards rebuilding efforts.[17] The financial help is expected more from international influences than from the local Brazilian population.

History [ edit ]

The former Imperial Palace that housed the National Museum

The National Museum was officially established by King João VI of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves (1769–1826) in 1818 with the name Royal Museum, in an initiative to stimulate scientific research in the Kingdom of Brazil, then a constituent part of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves. Initially, the museum housed plant and animal specimens, especially birds, which caused it to be known by locals n as the ""House of the Birds"".

After the marriage of King João VI's eldest son and Brazil's first Emperor, Dom Pedro I (1798–1834), to H.I. & R.H. Archduchess Maria Leopoldina of Austria (1797–1826), the Museum started to attract some of the greatest European naturalists of the 19th century, such as Maximilian zu Wied-Neuwied (1782–1867), Johann Baptist von Spix (1781–1826), and Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius (1794–1868). Other European researchers who explored the country, such as Augustin Saint-Hilaire (1799–1853) and the Baron von Langsdorff (1774–1852), contributed to the collections of the Royal Museum.[18]

By the end of the 19th century, reflecting the personal preferences of His Imperial Majesty Emperor Pedro II (1825–1891), the National Museum started to invest in the areas of the anthropology, paleontology and archaeology. The Emperor himself, who was an avid amateur scientist and enthusiastic supporter of all branches of science, contributed with several of the collections of the art of Ancient Egypt, botanical fossils, etc., which he acquired during many of his trips abroad. In this way, the National Museum was modernized and became the most important museum of natural history and human sciences of South America. Edmund Roberts visited the museum in 1832, noting that the museum only had three open rooms at that time, and that the closed rooms were ""sadly plundered of its contents by Don Pedro.""[19]

D. Pedro II was well aware of the shortage of true scientists and naturalists in Brazil. He fixed this problem by inviting foreign scientists to come to work at the Museum. The first to come was Ludwig Riedel (1761–1861), a German botanist who had participated in Baron von Langsdorff's famed expedition to Mato Grosso from 1826 to 1828. Other scientists to come were German chemist Theodor Peckolt and American geologist and paleontologist Charles Frederick Hartt (1840–1878). In the following years, the museum gradually became known so it continued to attract several foreign scientists who wished to achieve scientific stature with their work in Brazil, such as Fritz Müller (1821–1897), Hermann von Ihering (1850–1930), Carl August Wilhelm Schwacke (1848–1894), Orville Adalbert Derby (1851–1915), Émil August Goeldi (1859–1917), Louis Couty (1854–1884) and others; all of them were fired by museum director Ladislau Netto when the Emperor was deposed.

The Emperor was a very popular figure when he was deposed by a military coup in 1889, so the republicans tried to erase the symbols of the Empire. One of these symbols, the Paço de São Cristóvão, the official residence of the emperors in the Quinta da Boa Vista, became vacant; therefore, in 1892, the National Museum, with all its collections, valuables and researchers, was transferred to this palace, where it stays until today.

In 1946, the museum's management was passed to the University of Brazil, currently the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. The researchers and their offices and laboratories occupy a good part of the palace and other buildings erected at Botanical Gardens (Horto Florestal), in the Quinta da Boa Vista park – one of the largest scientific libraries of Rio. The National Museum offers graduate courses in the following areas: anthropology, sociology, botany, geology, paleontology, and zoology.

It was presented as a Lego Idea.[20]

Former collections [ edit ]

The museum sheltered one of the largest exhibits of the Americas, prior to the fire, consisting of animals, insects, minerals, aboriginal collections of utensils, Egyptian mummies and South American archaeological artifacts, meteorites, fossils and many other findings.

One of the meteorites that was on display is the Bendegó meteorite, which weighs over 5,000 kilograms (11,000 lb) and was discovered in 1784.[21]

Archaeology [ edit ]

The collection of archaeology of the National Museum comprised more than 100,000 objects, covering distinct several civilizations that lived in the Americas, Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, since the Paleolithic Age until the 19th century. The collection is subdivided into four main segments: Ancient Egypt, Mediterranean cultures, Pre-Columbian archaeology, and Pre-Columbian Brazil – last nucleus, systematically gathered since 1867, is the largest segment of the archaeological collection, as well as the most important collection of its typology in the world, covering the history of Pre-Cabraline Brazil in a very comprehensive manner and sheltering some of the most important material records related to Brazilian archaeology. It was, therefore, a collection of considerable scientific value, and object of several works of basic research, theses, dissertations, and monographs.[22][23]

Ancient Egypt [ edit ]

With more than 700 items, the collection of Egyptian archaeology of the National Museum was one of the largest of Latin America and one of the oldest in the Americas. Most part of the objects entered the museum collection in 1826, when the tradesman Nicolau Fiengo brought from Marseille an assemblage of Egyptian antiquities that belonged to the famous Italian explorer Giovanni Battista Belzoni, who had been in charge of excavating the Theban Necropolis (modern-day Luxor) and the Temple of Karnak.[24]

This collection had Argentina as the initial destination, and had probably been ordered by the president of that country, Bernardino Rivadavia, creator of the University of Buenos Aires and a noted enthusiast of museums. However, a naval blockade at the La Plata River would impede Fiengo from completing his journey, forcing him to return from Montevideo to Rio de Janeiro, where the pieces were offered at an auction. Emperor Pedro I bought the entire collection for five million réis, and subsequently donated it to the National Museum. It has been suggested that the action of Pedro I would have been influenced by José Bonifácio de Andrada, a relevant early member of Freemasonry in Brazil, perhaps driven by the interest that the organization had for the Egyptian iconography.[25][26] [27]

The collection started by Pedro I would be expanded by his son, emperor Pedro II, an amateur Egyptologist and notable collector of archaeological and ethnographic artifacts. One of the most important additions to the Egyptian collection of the National Museum made by Pedro II is the polychromed wood sarcophagus of the singer of Amun, Sha-Amun-en-su, from the Late Period, offered to the emperor as a gift during his second trip to Egypt, in 1876, by the Khedive Ismail Pasha. The sarcophagus is distinguished for its rarity, since it is one of few examples that have never been opened, still preserving the mummy of the singer in its interior.[24] The collection would be enriched through other acquisitions and donations, becoming, at the beginning of the 20th-century, sufficiently relevant to draw the attention of international researchers and Egyptologists, such as Alberto Childe, who served as conservator of the Department of Archaeology of the museum between 1912 and 1938 and was also responsible for publishing the Guide of the Collections of Classical Archaeology of the National Museum, in 1919.[25][26][27]

Egyptian mummy (""Princess Kherima""). Roman Period, 1st–3rd centuries AD.

Besides the aforementioned coffin of Sha-Amun-en-su, the museum possesses other three sarcophagi, from the Third Intermediate Period and the Late Era, belonging to three priests of Amun: Hori, Pestjef, and Harsiese. The museum also conserves six human mummies (four adults and two children), as well as a number of mummies and sarcophagi of animals (cats, ibises, fishes, and crocodiles). Among the human examples, the highlight is a mummy of a woman from the Roman Period, which is considered extremely rare for the preparatory technique used, of which there are only eight similar examples worldwide. Called ""princess of the Sun"" or ""princess Kherima"", the mummy has her members and fingers of the hands and feet individually swaddled and is richly adorned, with painted strips.[27] ""Princess Kherima"" is one of the most popular items of the National Museum collection, being even related to accounts of parapsychological experiences and collective trances, that supposedly occurred in the 1960s. ""Kherima"" also inspired the romance The Secret of the Mummy by Everton Ralph, member of the Rosicrucian society.[25][28][29]

The collection of votive and funerary steles is composed of dozens of pieces dated, in their majority, from the Intermediate Period and the Late Era. The steles of Raia and Haunefer, which are graved with titles of Semitic origins present in the Bible and in the tablets of Mari, stand out, as well as an unfinished stele, attributed to the emperor Tiberius, of the Roman Period. The museum also had a vast collection of shabtis, i.e. statuettes representing funerary servers, including a group of pieces that belonged to pharaoh Seti I, excavated from his tomb at the Valley of the Kings. The rare artifacts included a limestone statue of a young woman, dated of the New Kingdom, carrying a conic ointment vessel on the top of her head – an iconography that is almost exclusively found among paintings and reliefs. The collection also includes fragments of reliefs, masks, statues of deities in bronze, stone and wood (such as representations of Ptah-Sokar-Osiris), canopic jars, alabaster bowls, funerary cones, jewels, and amulets.[25][27][30]

The collection of classical archaeology of the National Museum added up to around 750 pieces and consists mostly of Greek, Roman, Etruscan, and Italiote objects, being the largest collection of its kind in Latin America. Most of the pieces previously belonged to the Greco-Roman collection of empress Teresa Cristina, who had been interested in archaeology since her youth. When the empress disembarked in Rio de Janeiro in 1843, right after her proxy wedding to emperor Pedro II, she brought an assemblage of antiquities found during the excavations of Herculaneum and Pompeii, the Ancient Roman cities destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD. Part of this collection had also belonged to Carolina Murat, sister of Napoleon Bonaparte and queen consort of the king of Naples, Joachim Murat.[31][32][33]

In turn, Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies, brother of empress Teresa Cristina, had ordered the excavations of Herculaneum and Pompeii, initiated in the 18th century, be resumed. The recovered pieces were sent to the Royal Bourbon Museum of Naples. Aiming to increase the number of classical artifacts in Brazil with a view to the future creation of a museum of Greco-Roman archaeology in the country, the empress established formal exchanges with the Kingdom of Naples. She requested the shipment of Greco-Roman objects to Rio de Janeiro, while sending artifacts of indigenous origins to Italy. The empress also personally financed excavations in Veios, an Etruscan archeological site located fifteen kilometers north of Rome, thus enabling a large part of the objects found there to be brought to Brazil. A greater part of those had been gathered between 1853 and 1859, but Teresa Cristina continued to enrich the collection until the fall of the Brazilian empire in 1889, when the Republic was proclaimed and the empress left the country with all the royal family.[31][32]

Among the highlights of the collection were a set of four frescos from Pompeii, made around the 1st century AD. Two of those are decorated with marine motifs, respectively depicting a sea dragon and a seahorse as the central figure surrounded by dolphins, and had adorned the lower walls of the room of the devotees at the Temple of Isis. The other two frescos are decorated with representations of plants, birds, and landscapes, stylistically close to the paintings of Herculaneum and Stabiae. The museum also housed a large number of objects from Pompeii portraying the daily life of Ancient Roman citizens: fibulae, jewels, mirrors, and other pieces of the Roman female toilette, glass and bronze vessels, phallic amulets, oil lamps molded in terracotta, etc.[28][33][34]

The collection of Mediterranean pottery comprised more than dozens of objects and is noted for the diversity of origins, shapes, decorations and utilitarian purposes. Several of the most important styles and schools of classical antiquity are represented, from the Corinthian geometric style of the 7th century BC to the Roman terracotta amphoras of the Early Christian era. The museum houses examples of kraters, oenochoai, kantharos, chalices, kyathos, cups, hydriai, lekythoi, askoi, and lekanides. The groups of Etruscan Bucchero pottery (7th–4th centuries BC), Greek black-figure vases (7th–5th centuries BC), Gnathian vessels (4th century BC), and the vast set of Italian red-figure vases, with ceramics from Apulia, Campania, Lucania and Magna Graecia, which also stand out.[28]

The collection of sculptures comprised a large number of Tanagra figurines, small terracotta sculptures of Greek origin that were widely appreciated in the Ancient world, as well as a group of Etruscan bronze statuettes representing warriors and female figures. The collection of military artifacts included entire pieces or fragments of helmets, maces, scabbards, bronze blades, brooches and phalleras.[28]

Pre-Columbian archaeology [ edit ]

The National Museum housed an important group of about 1,800 artifacts produced by the Indigenous peoples of the Americas during the Pre-Columbian era, as well as Andean mummies. Gathered throughout the 19th century, the collection was based on holdings of the Brazilian royal family, with several objects coming from the private collection of Emperor Pedro II. It was later enlarged through acquisitions, donations, exchanges, and excavations. By the end of the 19th-century, the collection already had considerable prestige, being cited, on the occasion of opening the 1889 Anthropological Exposition, as one of the largest collections of South American archaeology.[28][35][36]

The collection comprised mostly objects related to the textile manufacturing, featherwork, ceramic production, and stonecraft of the Andean cultures (groups of Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina) and, to a lesser extent, of the Amazonian natives (including a rare assemblage of artifacts from the area of present-day Venezuela) and Mesoamerican cultures (mainly from present-day Mexico and Nicaragua). Several aspects of the daily routine, social organization, religiosity, and imagery of the Pre-Columbian civilizations are addressed in the collection, which has items from common daily use (clothing, body ornaments, weapons) to more refined artifacts, imbued with notable artistic sense (measurement and musical instruments, ritual objects, figurative ceramic sculptures and vessels distinguished for their aesthetic features).[35][28] Other aspects of Pre-Columbian life, such as the dynamics of trade, ideological diffusion, and cultural influences among the groups, are also represented in the collection. Items are evaluated in terms of the similarity of decorative patterns and artistic techniques, as well as in the subjects portrayed. Common to nearly all distinct groups are such subjects as plants, nocturnal animals (bats, serpents, owls), and fantastic creatures associated to natural elements and phenomena.[37][28][38]

The best represented groups, in the context of Andean cultures, include:

The collection of Andean mummies of the National Museum allows a glimpse at the funerary practices of the cultures of the region. The mummies of the collection were preserved either naturally (as a result of the favorable geo-climatic conditions of the Andean Mountains) or artificially, in the context of religious and ritualistic practices. Originating from Chiu Chiu, at the Atacama Desert, northern Chile, there is a mummy of a man with an estimated age of 3,400 to 4,700 years, preserved in a seated position, with the head resting on the knees and covered by a wool cap. This was the position which the Atacaman cultures used to sleep, due to the cold climate of the desert. It was also the position in which they were buried, together with their belongings.[47] A second mummy in the collection – an Aymara man, found in the surroundings of Lake Titicaca, between Peru and Bolivia – is preserved in the same position, but involved in a funerary bundle.[48] The collection of mummies also include a boy, donated by the Chilean government, and, illustrating the techniques of artificial mummification of Pre-Columbian cultures, an example of a shrunken head, coming from the Jivaroan peoples of equatorial Amazon, of ritualistic purposes.[38][49]

Brazilian archaeology [ edit ]

The collection of Brazilian archaeology of the National Museum brought together a vast set of artifacts produced by the cultures that flourished in the Brazilian territory during the pre-colonial era, with more than 90,000 objects. It was considered the largest collection in its typology worldwide. Gradually assembled since the early 19th century, the collection started being systematically gathered since 1867 and has been continually expanded until the present day, through excavations, acquisitions and donations, also serving as basis for a large number of research projects conducted by the academics of the museum, the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, and other institutions. It was composed of objects coming from all regions of Brazil, establishing a timeline spanning more than 10,000 years.[38][23][22]

From the oldest inhabitants of the Brazilian territory (horticulturists and hunter-gatherer groups), the museum preserved several artifacts made of stone (flint, quartz and other minerals) and bones, such as projectile points used for hunting, axe blades of polished stone and other tools used for carving, scraping, cleaving, triturating, and piercing, in addition to artifacts of ceremonial use and adornments. Although objects made of wood, fiber, and resin were also produced, the majority of them didn't stand the test of time and are almost absent in the collection, except for some individual pieces – namely a woven straw basket covered by resin, only partially preserved, found in the southern coast of Brazil.[38][50][37][51]

In the segment regarding the Sambaqui people, i.e. the fishing and gathering communities which lived in the south-central coast of Brazil between 8,000 years before present and the early Christian era, the National Museum holds a large number of vestiges originating from deposits constituted of agglomerated lime and organic material – the so-called Sambaquis, or middens. Two fragments of Sambaquis are preserved in the collection, in addition to a group of human skeletal remains found in these archaeological sites, as well as several cultural testimonies of the Sambaqui people, encompassing utilitarian objects used in routine tasks (vessels, bowls, pestles and mortars carved in stone), ceremonies and rituals (such as votive statuettes). Among the highlights of the Sambaqui collection, there is a large set of zoolites (stone sculptures of votive use, with representation of animals, such as fish and birds, and human figures).[38][37]

The collection included several examples of funerary urns, rattles, dishes, bowls, clothing, dresses, idols, and amulets, with emphasis being placed on ceramic objects, produced by numerous cultures of precolonial Brazil.[38] Best represented groups in the collection include:

Marajoara culture, which flourished on Marajó island, at the mouth of the Amazon River, between the 5th and the 15th centuries, considered the group that reached the highest level of social complexity in precolonial Brazil. The museum has a vast assemblage of Marajoara pottery, notable for their heightened artistic and aesthetic sense, as well as for the variety of shapes and refined decoration – mostly works of figurative nature (representations of humans and animals), combined with rich geometric patterns (compositions imbued with symmetry, rhythmic repetitions, paired elements, binary oppositions, etc.) and with a predominant usage of the excision technique. Major part of the ceramic pieces are of ceremonial nature, used in funerary contexts, rites of passage, etc. Among the highlights, it's possible to mention the anthropomorphic statuettes (particularly the phallus-shaped female figurines, uniting the male and female principles, a recurring theme of the Marajoara art), large-scale funerary urns, anthropomorphic vases with geometric decoration, ritual thongs, zoomorphic, anthropomorphic and hybrid vessels, etc. [52]

Santarém culture (or Tapajós culture), which inhabited the region of the Tapajós River in the state of Pará, between the 5th and the 15th centuries, known for their ceramic work of peculiar style and high technical quality, produced with the techniques of modeling, incision, dotted lines, and appliqué, imbued with aesthetic features that suggest the influence of the Mesoamerican civilizations. Among the highlights of the collection were the anthropomorphic statuettes of naturalist style (characterised by the closed eyes, shaped like coffee beans), the anthropomorphic and zoomorphic vessels, vases for ceremonial use and, above all, the so-called ""caryatid vases"" – complex ceramic vessels, endowed with bottlenecks, reliefs and pedestals decorated with anthropomorphic and zoomorphic figurines and fantastic beings. The museum also possesses several examples of Muiraquitãs, i.e. small statuettes carved in green gems, shaped like animals (mainly frogs) used as adornments or amulets.[52]

Konduri culture, which reached their apex in the 7th century and met their decline in the 15th century, and inhabited the region between the Trombetas and Nhamundá rivers, in Pará. Although this culture kept an intense contact with the Santarém culture, their artistic production developed unique features. The Konduri collection is primarily composed of pottery, noted for the techniques of decoration such as incision and dotted lines, the lively polichromy, and the reliefs with anthropomorphic and zoomorphic motifs. [53]

Trombetas River culture, which inhabited the lower Amazon, in the state of Pará, near the region of Santarém. This culture, still largely unknown, was responsible for producing rare artifacts sculpted in polished stone and objects imbued with stylistic elements common to the Mesoamerican cultures. The museum collection preserves lithic artifacts of ceremonial use, as well as anthropomorphic and zoomorphic statuettes (zoolites representing fish and jaguars). [54]

Miracanguera culture, which flourished on the left bank of the Amazon river, in the region between Itacoatiara and Manaus, between the 9th and the 15th centuries. The museum preserved several examples of ceremonial pottery, mainly anthropomorphic funerary urns characterized by the presence of bulges, necks, and lids, used to store the ashes of the deceased, and other vessels related to funerary rituals. The Miracanguera pottery is distinguished for the presence of tabatinga layers (clay mixed with organic materials) and the eventual painted decoration of geometric motifs. The plastic composition frequently outlines specific details, such as human figures in a seated position, with the legs represented.[55]

Maracá culture, which lived in the region of Amapá between the 15th and the 18th centuries, represented in the collection by a group of typical funerary urns depicting male and female figurines in hierarchic position, with head-shaped lids, as well as zoomorphic funerary urns depicting quadrupedal animals, originating from indigenous cemeteries located in the outskirts of the Maracá River. The Maracá pottery was frequently adorned with geometric patterns and polychromed with white, yellow, red, and black pigments. Ornaments in the members and the head of the figures expressed the social identity of the deceased. [56]

Tupi-Guaraní culture, which inhabited the Brazilian coast when the Portuguese arrived in the 16th century – subdivided into the group of the Tupinambá people (in the North, Northeast, and Southeast regions of Brazil) and the group of the Guaraní people (in the South region of Brazil and parts of Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay). The collection is predominantly composed of ceramics and lithic artifacts of daily use (such as pans, bowls, jars, and dishes) or ritual nature (mainly funerary urns). The Tupi-Guaraní pottery is characterized by its distinct polychromy (with predominance of red, black, and white pigments) and drawings of geometric and sinuous patterns.[57]

The National Museum held the oldest known examples of indigenous mummies found in the Brazilian territory. The collection consisted of the body of an adult woman of approximately 25 years of age, and two children, one located at her feet, with an estimated age of twelve months, involved in a bundle, and a new-born, also covered by a mantle, positioned behind the head of the woman. This mummified set is composed of individuals that probably belonged to the group of the Botocudos (or Aimoré) people, of the Macro-Jê branch. They were found at the Caverna da Babilônia, a cavern located in the city of Rio Novo, interior of the state of Minas Gerais, in a farm that belonged to Maria José de Santana, who donated the mummies to emperor Pedro II. As an act of gratitude for this favor, Pedro II awarded Maria José with the title of Baroness of Santana.[58]

Financial difficulties [ edit ]

From 2014 the museum faced budget cuts that dropped its maintenance to less than R$ 520,000 annually. The budget was so low, there was US$ 0.01 to spend on each of the artifacts.[59] The building fell into disrepair, evidenced by peeling wall material, exposed electrical wiring, and termite problem.[60][59] By June 2018, the museum's 200th anniversary, it had reached a state of near-complete abandonment.[61] There was an offer from the World Bank to purchase the museum for US$80 m, which was turned down because the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro would have to give up ownership.[59]

According to the dean of UFRJ Denise Pires de Carvalho, the university does not have the money to pay bills of light delayed since January 2019, of water since 2 years, of security and cleaning services. She also said that although they do not have any more money available, she would seek the release of 20% of the R$43 million released by the parliamentary bench in Rio de Janeiro to continue the reconstruction works of the National Museum. It aims to reopen at least one wing of the palace in 2022, the year of independence bicentennial.[62]

2018 fire [ edit ]

The building was heavily damaged by a large fire which began about 19:30 local time (23:30 UTC) on 2 September 2018.[10][12][67]

Although some items were saved, it is believed that 92.5% of its archive of 20 million items were destroyed in the fire, though circa 1.5 million items are stored in a separate building, which were not damaged.[11]

First responders fighting the fire were hindered by a lack of water. Rio's fire chief claimed that two nearby fire hydrants had insufficient water, leaving firefighters to resort to pumping water from a nearby lake. According to a CEDAE (Rio de Janeiro's Water and Sewerage State Company [pt]) employee, although the hydrants did have water, the water pressure was very low, due to the fact that the building is on top of a hill.[68][69] Brazilian President Michel Temer claimed the loss due to the fire to be ""incalculable.""[67]

Background [ edit ]

Museum Deputy Director Luiz Fernando Dias Daniel pointed to neglect by successive governments as a cause of the fire,[70][71] saying that curators ""fought with different governments to get adequate resources to preserve what is now completely destroyed"" and that he felt ""total dismay and immense anger.""[72] The museum lacked a fire sprinkler system, although there were smoke detectors and a few fire extinguishers.[73][74] The museum did not receive the R$520,000 per year necessary for its maintenance since 2014, and it closed temporarily in 2015 when cleaning and security staff could no longer be paid. Repairs to a popular exhibit hall had to be crowd-funded, and the museum's maintenance budget had been cut by 90 per cent by 2018.[75] There were visible signs of decay before the fire, such as peeling walls and exposed wiring.[76] The museum celebrated its 200th anniversary in June 2018 in a situation of partial abandonment. No state ministers attended the occasion.[72][77][78]

Fire [ edit ]

A large fire broke out shortly after the museum closed on 2 September 2018, reaching all three floors of the building.[79][80][81] Firefighters were called at 19:30 local time (22:30 UTC)[82] and arrived quickly at the scene.[78] However, the fire chief reported that the two fire hydrants closest to the museum had no water, and trucks had to be sent to a nearby lake.[83] According to the spokesman for the fire department, the fire crews went inside the burning building to rescue artifacts, despite there being no people inside, and they were able to remove items with the help of museum staff.[84][85]

The fire was out of control by 21:00 (00:00 UTC 3 September), with great flames and occasional explosions,[86] being fought by firefighters from four sectors.[87] Dozens of people went to Quinta da Boa Vista to see the fire.[78] A specialized team of firefighters entered the building at 21:15 to block areas still not hit by the flames and to evaluate the extent of the damage.[88] However, by 21:30, the whole building had been engulfed by the fire, including exhibitions of Imperial rooms that were in the two areas at the front of the main building. The four security guards who were on duty at the museum managed to escape; first reports stated that there were no casualties, although a firefighter suffered burns to the fingers while trying to rescue the Luzia's fossil.[87][89]

Two fire engines were used with turntable ladders, with two water trucks taking turns to supply water.[83][88] The Brazilian Marine Corps also provided fire engines, water trucks, and a decontamination unit from a nearby base.[90] Pictures on social media showed artifacts being rescued from the burning building by firefighters and civilians.[91]

At 22:00 (01:00 UTC 3 September), dozens of museum employees joined the fight against the flames. Two floors of the building were already destroyed by this time, and the roof had collapsed.[88] Brazilian Culture Minister Sérgio Sá Leitão suggested that it was probably caused by either an electric fault or by a sky lantern accidentally landing on the building.[92]

Damage to collection [ edit ]

Paço de São Cristóvão following the fire.

A building area of 13,600 square metres (146,000 sq ft) with 122 rooms was destroyed. The building was started in 1803 with luso-lebanese Elie Antun Lubbus.[93] According to museum officials, approximately 92.5 percent of the collection has been destroyed.[94] The building was uninsured.[95]

A spokesman for the fire department reported that pieces had been recovered from the blaze, due to efforts from firefighters and workers from the museum.[96] Information about the condition of pieces that had been displayed started being reported as early as late 2 September, when the images of items had been shared. One of these was a Roman fresco from Pompeii that had survived the eruption of Vesuvius, but was lost in the fire.[97]

Preservation director of the museum João Carlos Nara told reporters that ""very little will be left"" and that they would ""have to wait until the firefighters have completed their work here in order to really assess the scale of it all.""[98] The next day, firefighters began more salvage work inside the museum, trying to rescue what they could from beneath the charred remains of the collapsed roof.[99]

The collection relating to indigenous languages is believed to have been completely destroyed, including the recordings since 1958, the chants in all the extinct languages, the Curt Nimuendajú archives (papers, photos, negatives, the original ethnic-historic-linguistic map localizing all the ethnic groups in Brazil, the only extant record from 1945), and the ethnological and archaeological references of all ethnic groups in Brazil since the 16th century.[100] One of the linguistic researchers, Bruna Franchetto, who returned only to see her office as a pile of ash, criticised the fact that a project to back up the collection digitally had only just received funding and barely started, asking for any student who had ever come to the museum to scan or photocopy things for projects to send a copy back.[101]

The fire destroyed the museum's collection of thousands of indigenous artifacts from the country's pre-Columbian Indo-American culture. The items include many indigenous peoples' remains as well as relics amassed in the personal collection of Pedro II.[102][103] This collection also featured items from present native tribes, including ""striking feather art by the Karajá people"". There are only about 3,000 Karajá people left.[103]

Indigenous people expressed anger that there was no money given to a museum with indigenous history but ""the city had recently managed to find a huge budget to build a brand new Museum of Tomorrow"".[72] Cira Gonda also confirmed shortly after the fire that the indigenous linguistics collected had been completely destroyed, and so that original recordings of spoken word and song in dead languages have been lost, as well as other artifacts including those detailing the land and language distribution of tribes in Brazil.[100]

Surviving items [ edit ]

The burned facade.

Some items survived the fire. The Bendegó meteorite from the museum's collection of meteorites, which is the biggest iron meteorite ever found in Brazil, was unscathed, due to its inherent fire-resistance.[104][105] From images and video of salvage after the fire, at least three other meteorites also survived undamaged.[106][107] Another meteorite called Angra dos Reis was rediscovered among the debris. The meteorite is worth R$ 3 million and was lost in the rubble of the National Museum. With a mass 76 thousand times smaller than that of Bendegó, with mere 65 grams and 4 cm long, Angra dos Reis rock is the most valuable of the collection and was already the object of meteorite hunters. In more than a century of research, this fragment was divided into small portions. The biggest one was buried in the rubble of the museum.[108][109] Some meteorites were found on 19 October 2018, including the Angra dos Reais, besides, burnt.[110]

In the days following the fire, firefighters recovered several portraits from the upper floor of the museum, which had been burnt, smoke and water damaged but not destroyed. Cristiana Serejo, deputy director of the museum, also said that ""part of the zoological collection, the library and some ceramics"" had survived.[111] Images were shared of research microscopes, freezers, and specimen jars being collected outside of the building by museum staff during the fire, next to a rusted hydrant.[106] During the fire, part of the Zoology department pulled out mollusks and other marine specimens, and only stopped due to the imminent danger the fire posed.[112] The fire did not reach an annex of the site where vertebrate specimens were kept, but due to a loss of electricity parts of the collection could become damaged.[113]

During the salvage, an intact skull that appeared to be that of Luzia Woman was found, and sent to a nearby scientific laboratory for analysis.[114] Due to other skulls and fragments of bones were discovered in the remains of the building prompting a need for lab testing on the found items.[113] On 19 October 2018, it was announced that the Luzia skull indeed was found however as many fragments, which 80% were identified as being part of the frontal (forehead and nose), side, bones that are more resistant and the fragment of a femur that also belonged to the fossil and was stored. A part of the box where Luiza's skull was, was also recovered. Though the assembly of them was postponed.[115] The bones became white, because the earth along them were burned.

A portion of the museum's collection, specifically the herbarium, and fish and reptile species, was housed elsewhere and has not been affected.[116] There was also a large scientific library within the museum, containing thousands of rare works. People on social media were reported to have found burnt pages from the library in the nearby streets;[103] it was later confirmed that the library proper is housed in an adjacent building and was mostly undamaged.[117] Some burnt pages, of unknown origin, were recovered by security guards. Nine Torah scrolls from the 15th century had previously been on display but were in the library at the time and survived.[95]

Reactions [ edit ]

Picture shows funerary vases destroyed

Brazil's president, Michel Temer, said that ""the loss of the National Museum is incalculable for Brazil. Today is a tragic day for our country's museology. Two hundred years of work, research and knowledge were lost. The value of our history cannot be measured now, due to the damage to the building that housed the Royal Family during the Empire. It is a sad day for all Brazilians.""[72][118] His statement was echoed by Rio Mayor Marcelo Crivella, who called for rebuilding stating: ""It's a national obligation to reconstruct it from the ashes, recompose every detail of the paintings and photos. Even if they are not original, they will continue to be a reminder of the royal family that gave us independence, the empire and the first constitution and national unity"".[119]

The archaeologist Zahi Hawass says that the tragedy legitimizes the movement for the repatriation of Egyptian objects in museums around the world and that if museums are not able to guarantee the safety and conservation of the objects, the archaeologist argues that to be returned to the native land. Although the collection of the National Museum was not targeted by Egyptian archaeologists, Hawass says that the destruction of the collection strengthens the movement for the repatriation of objects and that UNESCO observes countries with overseas collections and overseas museums to control them, to ensure that objects are properly protected and restored.[120]

French President Emmanuel Macron expressed his condolences on Twitter at the event. He offered to send experts to help rebuild the museum.[121]

Brazilian environmentalist and politician Marina Silva called the fire ""a lobotomy of the Brazilian memory"".[72]

News of the fire quickly spread through the city of Rio de Janeiro, and protesters turned up at the gates in the early hours of Monday morning. Initial reports suggested that there were 500 people, forming a chain around the still-smoking building.[99] Some of the protesters tried to climb over fencing into the museum grounds; the police who were called to attend, in full riot gear, threw tear gas bombs into the crowds. The public were later allowed to enter the grounds.[92]

A group of Museum Studies students from the Federal University of the State of Rio de Janeiro called for the public to send in any photographs or videos of the destroyed collections. Their appeal received 14,000 videos, photos, and drawings of the museum's exhibitions within hours.[122]

Cultural institutions [ edit ]

The president of the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage, Kátia Bogéa, said that ""It's a national and worldwide tragedy. Everybody can see that this is not a loss for the Brazilian people, but for the whole humanity"" and commented that it was ""a predictable tragedy, because we've known for a long time that Brazilian cultural heritage has no budget"".[118]

Museums around the world sent their condolences. In the UK, the British Library said ""our hearts go out to the staff and users of [the National Museum] of Brazil"" and called the fire ""a reminder of the fragility and preciousness of our shared global heritage"";[123] London's Natural History Museum,[124] the Oxford University Museum of Natural History,[125] and the Smithsonian Institution[126] were among other institutions expressing their sorrow. The head of the Australian Museum said that she was ""shocked"", ""devastated"", and ""distraught"".[127] Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities expressed both solidarity with the museum and concern over the status of more than 700 ancient Egyptian artifacts that were housed in the building. It offered to send experts, if requested by the Brazilian government, to assist the National Museum in restoring the damaged pieces.[128]

Salvage efforts [ edit ]

On 12 September 2018, work began to implement a plan to temporarily shelter and work with what is currently the ruins of the museum:[129]

Wooden structures, including a metallic wall, completely surrounding the São Cristovão Palace to protect what remains of the building,

Containment measures for the building to avoid risk of landslide,

An improvised roof to protect against rain water,

Modules and containers outside to serve as temporary research laboratory space.

For this plan, the Brazilian government offered R$9 million as an emergency budget which has since been received by the museum. The company, Concrejato, is contracted to reinstall the walls of the building at a cost of R$8,998,075.66.[130] and Unesco says that the reconstruction would take 10 years to get ready.[131] Researchers are recreating 300 parts of the collection of the National Museum, including the skull of Luzia, with 3D printers. The studies are being resumed in a laboratory of the National Institute of Technology (INT), by master's and doctoral students of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.[132]

The museum is still doing some festivals called Museu Nacional Vive or Museum lives to public in tents mounted in front of current under construction improvements to the burned headquarters, with exposition of fossils, living snakes and taxidermied animals like Pterosaurs and Armadillo among others. The museum would do a permanent exposition outside. By some estimates, it would take R$100 million to rebuild the main dependencies. With the exception of a few metal cabinets intact, there are only charred fragments. Around 80% of the roof and 60% of the floors have been affected. The one million euro aid announced by Germany would allow the installation of laboratories for analysis of archaeological finds.[133][134][135]

The museum director said there is a collective effort to rebuild the collection, pursue research, and plan the reconstruction of the institution housing six major graduate programs. He reported that classes, thesis defenses and dissertations were resumed and knowledge production did not stop. ""The National Museum has lost part of its collection but has not lost the ability to create knowledge and do science,"" said the director.[136] The social anthropology library, one of the most important in Latin America and totally destroyed by the fire, has received a considerable amount of donations, including the personal library of Rio de Janeiro researcher Gilberto Velho (1945–2012), who was dean of the Department of Anthropology of the museum until his death. Museum zoologists have already gone to the field to collect new specimens in an attempt to repopulate the invertebrate collection, one of the richest (with 5 million copies only in the case of insects) and harder hit by the fire. Before a revamped headquarters is available, Kellner said the museum's intention is to re-display its collection – still considerable – to the public. There is a collective funding campaign to allow the institution's loan back to schools and the plan to revitalize the museum's botanical garden so that it houses a small exhibition that would receive visitors again. ""It would be an illusion, even a frivolous thing, to say that the old collection will be reconstituted, but we will continue to fulfill our role,"" said the director.[137] It was also informed they plan to keep part of ruins as historical exposition with a high modern structure of equipment inside.

According to UFJR dean Roberto Leher, the facade and the exterior of the National Museum is to be preserved in the reconstruction works, but the building could be different. The recovery of the building will take into account a new concept of architecture. The cost would still depend on the concept of the museum. Technicians focus are on 3D modeling and a term of reference. New materials with low-carbon, energy-less, environmentally friendly will be used because it is a science museum. IPHAN has endorsed (since the property is overturned) to do the reconstruction taking this model into account.[138] The new project could be with high roof space or with more slabs, depending the approval of R$100 million or € 22,610,000,00 in the budget of 2019.[139]

On 7 May 2019, the museum presented 27 small pieces found of Egypt collection. The current director took the chance to ask for more money, a minimum of R$1 million to guarantee his services further.[140] On 14 May 2019, the statue of the Bés god about 2,350 years old was found. The piece in rock and glass paste was one of the highlights of the collection.[141]

The roof was finished on 8 June 2019, nine months after the fire. It is 23 m high sustained by 42 truss tower pillars with 30 thousand steel bars and 147 tons of total weight.[142]

Cooperation agreement with the Italian government provides for restoration of damaged parts and long-term loan of Italian parts that would be displayed in the National Museum when it is ready for reopening. Until then, the exhibition would be installed in the Sala Roma of the Consulate General of Italy, in the Center of Rio de Janeiro. The Italian Ministry of Culture would collaborate in the restoration of a Koré, an important Greek female statue, which was found in 1853 in a tomb in Italy, in which Empress Teresa of Bourbon brought dowry of her marriage to Emperor Pedro II of Brazil.[143] However, the director denied to borrow pieces. Instead, he prefers money donations, which is denied by Italian and French governments. Samba Mangueira and Chico Buarque tries with music to help the museum in some way.[144][145]

Reconstruction [ edit ]

During the signing of a protocol of intent for technical-scientific cooperation with the Brazilian Institute of Museums (Ibram), held on 14 May 2019, it was reported that the works of restoration of the patrimony would be initiated in 2019, with an elaborated executive project of the reconstruction of the facades and of the roof, with an endowment of R$1 million. Paulo Amaral, president of Ibram, said that the new concept of the National Museum would probably be announced in April 2020, when the final formatting of the space would be defined, with parts dedicated to the historical collection, contemporary works and equipment.[146][147]

On the first floor of the building was the Francisca Keller Library, which had the largest collection of anthropology and human sciences in South America. To speed up the fundraising process, they are making a crowdfunding campaign on the Benfeitoria platform. The money would be used for the demolition of the interior walls of the space, restoring the floor, finishing and painting, laying the ceiling, making the electrical and air conditioning installation and the restoration of hardware. They expect to get R$129,000 by 12 September 2019.[146][148]

The Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, responsible for the museum, signed on Saturday 31 August 2019 a memorandum of understanding with the Vale Foundation, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the BNDES to create a governance steering committee that can lead the museum's recovery project. Vale provides R$50 million and BNDES R$21.7 million for this reconstruction.[149] The Ministry of Education had allocated R$16 million to the National Museum. Of this total, R$8.9 million was used in emergency works, and the rest for facade and roof projects. The Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovations and Communications contributed R$10 million to acquire equipment for scientific research and infrastructure actions. Germany had donated 230,000 euros so far.[150] After 1 year since the destruction, 44% of the museum's collections had been saved. More than 50 of the 70 areas hit by the fire were searched.

Reconstruction of the facade and roof is expected to take place between the end of 2019 and the beginning of 2020. In the first half of 2020, the salvage of parts of the collection and the start of the inventory process are expected to be completed. R$69 million in public funds for the project. The amount is composed of R$21 million from BNDES (R$3.3 million of which have already been released), R$43 million from the amendment of the Rio de Janeiro bench in the Chamber of Deputies and R$5 million from the Ministry Education.[151]

On 3 October 2019, the museum has about 120 million reais available to make works, coming from funds from parliamentary amendments, the BNDES and Vale. But, the money cannot be used to buy the material needed to continue the rescue, only in the works. In the box of the Association Friends of the National Museum, there are 80 thousand reais in cash, coming from donations, but only R$25 thousand are not yet committed. The Rio de Janeiro Legislative Assembly (Alerj) donated R$20 million to help in the works. Funding are available as project steps are completed.[152]

Political influences [ edit ]

Figures which had been in the museum

The director of the National Museum, Alexander W. A. Kellner, issued an open letter addressed to presidential candidates Jair Messias Bolsonaro and Fernando Haddad on the evening of 15 October 2018, which, along two pages, reinforces the historical importance of the institution, and recalls that his survival is tied to the responsibility of those who hold ""power in the hands.""[166]

The document was also sent to the National Congress, where he had regularly gone to ask for a public hearing, during which he asked for the inclusion of resources for the museum, and for the next budget. Without these resources, he says the institution will end up harming decades of research.

In the letter, the director says that many reflect on what could have been done differently to avoid a disaster that led to the loss of an invaluable patrimony, involving millions of cultural and scientific pieces. He also adds that ""others should be deeply reflecting on why, being in a position of decision, they did not act firmly in triggering actions that would have avoided the absurdity of that loss"".

On 17 October 2018, the Director of the Museum had a meeting with federal deputies to first resolve the R$50 million needed to reinstall the front part of Palace.[167] In late October 2018, the museum's director attended an audience in Brasília at the Chamber of Deputies in order to secure R$56 million for the basic reconstruction of the front part of main building, No. 1, including the facade, roof and its structure. He negotiated the money before the President-elect Jair Bolsonaro, being afraid that the building would remain destroyed for years in an abandoned state. Also, the laboratory containers were not received.[168] On 31 October 2018, the Chamber of Deputies approved an amendment of R$55 million to the budget of 2019. This would need to be further approved by a joint committee and also by the plenary.[169] The Director travelled to China to guarantee pieces of collections for the museum. During his travel to (Germany), specifically Berlin, Munich and Paris, France to bargain some money, the amount of R$55 million, supposed to reconstruct some part of building was reduced to R$43 million by Government.[170] However the Louvre Museum could lend some Egyptian pieces to be displayed in Rio de Janeiro, when its reconstruction comes done. From this sum, until June 2019, Education Ministry or Ministério da Educação (MEC) paid R$908.800,00 for the facade project.[162]

A proposal by Senator Maria do Carmo Alves (DEM-SE) under review in the Commission of Education, Culture and Sport proposes to include a National Day of the Museum, in the official Brazilian calendar to be celebrated on 18 May.[171]

Until December 2018, the concern was the change of the Brazilian Government, because none of the transition teams of the future Governor of Rio de Janeiro, nor the President of the Republic Jair Messias Bolsonaro have sought the direction of the museum to talk about the disaster that hit the former Residence of the Imperial Family. Even then, the containers to store restored objects, until the reconstruction work is completed, had not yet been delivered by the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, which did not express its opinion on the delay.[172]

Recent events [ edit ]

During the three months after the fire debris was removed, the ""economic support network"" promised by the president was not established. The partnership to help the museum would count on the participation of the Brazilian Federation of Banks (Febraban), Petrobrás, Bradesco, Itaú, Santander, Caixa, Banco do Brasil, BNDES and Vale. According to the entity, the banks are awaiting approval of Provisional Measure 851 in the National Congress to be able to make the donations. The text must be approved by Congress until February 2019. If this does not happen, the Provisional Measure loses its validity. ""The first disbursement of the contract between the BNDES, the Association of Friends of the National Museum and UFRJ, with a total execution period of four years, was scheduled for October 2018 of R$ 3 million.""

In June 2018, when the National Museum completed 200 years, the BNDES signed a R$21.7 million contract to pay for the update of the building, but before the first transfer of R$3 million, it caught fire. The agreement was maintained, and the BNDES promised that the money would be used to support the reconstruction works. That was not done. Until final of 2018, only R$8.9 million was released to carry out emergency works for the reconstruction of the building.[173]

The Ministry of Education (MEC) gave R$5 million to a second phase of elaboration of recovery project of the Museum. Unesco personnel and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs visited the debris. Another R$2.5 million was allocated to the research of the institution through the Coordination of Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (Capes).[174]

1,500 items were found among the rubble, between parts of the collection, equipment, personal property and others not unidentifiable. Among them were pieces from the Egyptian collection and minerals from the Werner collection, that came to Brazil along with the Portuguese Crown, as well as pre-Columbian ceramics.

A partnership with Google Brasil, through Google Arts & Culture, allowed guided virtual tours via internet of 160 items from the collections in 2016.[175][176]

‘Unwavering support’ against ‘Iranian aggression’? Israel welcomes record $38bn US military aid,Israel welcomes record $38bn US military aid,0.0,"Benjamin Netanyahu has welcomed a historic $38bn US military aid package, negotiated by the previous US administration and released just in time to help the Jewish state withstand the ‘complex’ threat posed by its arch-enemy Iran.

Two years after President Barack Obama and the Israeli Prime Minister signed a Memorandum of Understanding, the 10-year military funding deal went into effect on Monday, with the start of the new fiscal year. Netanyahu welcomed the deal as the means to tackle the threat from the Islamic Republic, after the State Department noted that the package is aimed to protect Israel against ""all potential regional adversaries"", but foremost from the ""Iranian regime’s sponsorship of terrorist groups"".

אני מודה לממשל האמריקני ולקונגרס על מחויבותם לישראל ועל כספי הסיוע האמריקנים גם בעשור הקרוב. בפני ישראל והעולם אתגרים ביטחוניים מורכבים, ובראשם התוקפנות האיראנית. התמיכה הבלתי מסויגת של ארה""ב בזכותה של ישראל להגן על עצמה היא מעמודי התווך בקשר האיתן בין המדינות — Benjamin Netanyahu (@netanyahu) October 2, 2018

“Israel and the world face complex security challenges, first and foremost the Iranian aggression,” Netanyahu tweeted in Hebrew on Tuesday. “The unwavering support of the United States for Israel's right to defend itself is one of the pillars of the strong relationship between the two countries.”

Under the terms of the deal, outlined in the US-Israel Security Assistance Authorization Act of 2018, Israel will receive an annual funding of $3.3 billion in Foreign Military Financing and $500 million for cooperative programs for missile defense. Specifically, the US has authorized the transfer of precision-guided munitions from reserve stocks, which are “necessary for Israel to counter the threat of rockets in a timely fashion.” The act also expands a stockpile of weapons the US stores in Israel, which the country may access in wartime.

Netanyahu and President Donald Trump, unlike the previous Obama administration, have been persistently warning against an allegedly imminent threat from Iran. Israel especially welcomed Trump's decision to withdraw from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, in a unilateral move that other signatories, mainly Russia and China, said could jeopardize regional and global security.

Netanyahu has said Israel will continue to strike Iranian targets in Syria despite Russia's S-300 anti-missile systems pic.twitter.com/zYH8TN3APa — RT (@RT_com) September 27, 2018

Last week, both Netanyahu and Trump were once again united in their condemnation of Tehran during their performances at the United Nations General Assembly. While Trump accused Tehran of “enabling Syria's butchery” and vowed that he will never allow the nation to acquire nuclear weapons, Netanyahu brandished slides revealing yet “another secret atomic facility” in Iran.

In the meantime, Israel continues to maintain the right to strike ‘Iranian targets’ whenever and wherever it deems necessary, totally disregarding the sovereignty of neighboring states. Tel Aviv justifies its actions by the need to prevent Tehran from establishing a foothold on its borders and to stop alleged weapons transfers to Lebanese Hezbollah.

"Some 60,000 California homeless could get coronavirus in coming weeks, governor says","Some 60,000 California homeless could get coronavirus in coming weeks, governor says",0.0,"By Dan Whitcomb

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Modeling has shown that more than 60,000 homeless people could become ill with the coronavirus in California over the next eight weeks, badly straining the healthcare system, the state governor said on Wednesday.

Hospitalization rates for those infected with the flu-like disease was about 20%, creating a requirement for additional hospital beds that could quickly overwhelm hospitals if the modeled predictions come true, Governor Gavin Newsom said.

""Over the next eight-week period, we have modeled that of the 108,000 unsheltered Californians that are out on the streets, if you had an attack rate of about 56%, you're looking at 60-plus thousand individuals that may have COVID-19,"" Newsom, a Democrat, said in a Facebook address to the state.

""That creates a deep point of anxiety for the existing population but moreover for our healthcare delivery system, our capacity to move people in and out of the shelters safely without contacting other people and putting them at risk as well.""

California, the nation's most populous state, has also been among the hardest hit by the coronavirus outbreak, with 598 confirmed cases as of Wednesday, a 21% increase over the day before. At least 17 fatalities have been reported in California.

The governor said he had issued an executive order authorizing the distribution of an $100 million to cities and counties across California to blunt the impact of the respiratory illness on the homeless, and had acquired 1,300 trailers to use as temporary housing.

Another executive order directed that $50 million be used to convert motels and hotels into shelters where homeless people could be isolated if they caught the virus.

Newsom said he had spoken to the Trump administration about anchoring a U.S. Navy medical ship, the Mercy, off the Californian coast to house additional patients and to set up field hospitals in the state.

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said the state's largest city was making a new push to identify homeless people considered most vulnerable to the virus, including the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions.

Story continues

The Democratic mayor said that up to 6,000 of those potential coronavirus victims would be given beds in city recreational centers.

Patients suspected of carrying the virus would be isolated in emergency trailers, a move paid for by tapping into state funds made available by the governor.

LOS ANGELES – A 102-year-old woman is being forced out of her home in Ladera Heights, California, according to KCBS.

Family and friends of Thelma Smith are banding together after she received an eviction notice and is being forced to relocate.

Smith’s landlord intends to move his daughter into the residence once she graduates from law school.

Smith has lost most of her family over the years, including her husband, and her remaining family lives on the East Coast.

Her family and friends said her options are limited to moving in with someone nearby or moving into assisted living which is difficult to do on her fixed income.

“Right now it’s the unknown that’s bothering her as far relocating her to her new places,” said family friend Antonio Avelino. “She couldn’t afford it she would need some assistance from county and other friends to support her in these places.”

KCBS’ Amy Johnson spoke to the landlord.

“We know legally you can make her leave but 102? Would you kick out a 102-year-old woman?” asked Johnson.

The landlord replied by saying, “Would you take care of your child?”

“The only thing that I can say is that I’ve tried to live a good life. I’ve never wanted to harm anybody,” said Smith.

Smith must vacate the house by June 30.

In the meantime, her friends are looking for places for her to live in the area.

Subway travelers watch as man punishes helpless elderly woman,Subway travelers watch as man punishes helpless elderly woman,0.0,"The New York police are looking for a man who attacked an elderly woman in front of astonished fellow travelers. Video footage shows how the 40-year-old attacker kicks on and hits the 78-year-old woman. After his frenzy, the man flees the subway train and disappears without a trace.

The violent incident took place on March 10, around three o’clock in the morning. The seated woman, who travels alone, still tries in vain to ward off the man’s punches and stairs. The old lady is hit on the body and face. Other passengers watch and take pictures of the brutal attack, but no one sticks out. “Oh, no,” they say.

“Who the hell were you talking to?” The man shouts. A female metro passenger is still trying to reason him and says “excuse me ….” The aggressive person gets out of his feet and shouts, just before he gets out of the metro, “Just Worldstar…”, referring to the social media website on which violence videos are shared.

“Worldstar that’s it,” the man shouts and gets rid of himself. Violence videos are shared on the Worldstar website.

The police are only informed of the attack when the metro train arrives at the next stop. One of the fellow travelers holds a cop at the terminal station. The bleeding elderly person is treated on the spot by caregivers with swellings and cuts in her face. The woman refuses further medical assistance, reports the New York Post. The gruesome images, which also ended up on Twitter, are causing a great deal of fuss. Especially the fact that no one undertakes anything makes people angry. “He’s crazy, that’s someone’s grandmother,” says the person who posted the video. “Retweet and find this jerk”. When asked if he is the creator of the video, he responds with: “No, if I had been there it would have ended differently.”

Investigators hope to get in touch with the bearded woman and search diligently for her assailant. Chief Inspector Dermot Shea asks eyewitnesses to report. Public transport company MTA has promised the police every help to find the perpetrator. “This is such an extremely shocking video,” said spokesperson Amanda Kwam. “We will help the investigation where we can.”

When the little one started to cry because of the commotion, it was attacked by a Malinois dog and bitten no less than 56 times.

The facts happened on Sunday, according to the regional newspaper Nice-Matin. Some of the neighbors had then gathered for dinner, and there was heavy drinking.

Quarrel

At some point, the host got into a misunderstanding with the child’s father and they even started to fight. The host’s dog – a Malinois Shepherd – intervened to defend his master and bit the father of the child, in his twenties.

Because of all the commotion, the bitten man’s child started to cry and the dog turned against him. The animal attacked and bit the child no less than 56 times over his entire body. The child was seriously injured and was taken to the hospital in Nice and appeared to be bitten in the arms and thighs.

The child’s father and the host of the dinner were arrested, but they were released on Monday. They will have to make a statement later because they were under the influence of alcohol at the time of the facts. The social service will also drop by and start an investigation.",https://www.afrinik.com/3-year-old-child-bitten-56-times-by-a-malinois-dog/

The 37-year-old had not even left the parking lot of the prison, where he saw his chance to immediately steal again.

On Thursday, Lewis was admitted to the St. Lucie County Detention Facility in Fort Piece, Florida, where he had been detained for theft. But he clearly cannot resist stealing.

In the parking lot of the prison, he looked curiously into different cars and he also sat down for a few minutes in a silver car that he had gotten into. He then walked around a little further in the parking lot and checked with other cars whether the doors were locked.

A cop came to take a look and was told that the man was “waiting for his girlfriend”. But then the cop’s eye fell on the brown bag in the hand of the former prisoner. It contained a lot of captured items, including an iPhone 7, four packs of cigarettes, a lighter, a Visa card, a driver’s license and $547 cash.

The officer immediately escorted Lewis back to prison. He has been officially charged with the car theft and was allowed to use the deposit again later in the day.

Father of torn child: Courtney hung bleeding between jaws of leopard,Father of torn child: Courtney hung bleeding between jaws of leopard,0.0,"Father Isaiah Ntimane no longer gets the horrible sight of his 2-year-old son Courtney between the bloody jaws of a leopard. What should have been a cozy family dinner in the South African Kruger Park ended on Wednesday in an unprecedented drama. The smell of the barbecue attracted the predator to the garden of the Ntimanes, after which he jumped over a fence and struck a tree.

The family sat in the garden of their home in the national park in the evening, around eight o’clock, when it went terribly wrong. Father Isaiah walked in for a moment and left his son in the garden. He describes the icy cry he heard the moment the leopard bite into the darkness. “I closed the door of the house behind and suddenly heard screams outside,” says the grieving father. “I ran outside again to see what was going on and saw him in the mouth of the predator.”

Presumably, it has been the smell of fresh meat on the barbecue that has attracted the leopard. When the animal managed to get over the fence through a tree, little Courtney was an easy prey. “I had left him to play with his mother’s phone,” Isaiah said. The toddler was repeatedly bitten by the feline in the neck and body. The predator tried to drag the heavily bleeding boy across the fence to devour him in the dark.

“Too painful”

Crying, Isaiah tells the local newspaper The Star how the leopard dropped Courtney when he approached him. The beast jumped over the fence and disappeared into the park. The terrified parents hurriedly brought their seriously injured son to the Shongwe hospital, but there was nothing left to do for the little fellow. Isaiah was deceased upon arrival. “They put him on a bed and looked into his eyes, but saw no sign of life anymore.”

The drama is even greater because the father normally lives alone in the park. His family lives outside the park and had come to the staff apartments especially for the barbecue. “It is very hard for my wife and me,” he says. “I no longer dare to leave my house to go to work. As soon as I come outside, I experience again what happened. The memory is just too painful.”

A gamekeeper has traced and shot the leopard to prevent new attacks.

14 lions escaped

Barely two days after the drama with the little Courtney, an estimated fourteen lions have been able to bypass the fences of the South African park. The escaped predators are now sneaking around a phosphorus line in Phalaborwa, reports South African channel News24.

Park managers try to trace the animals and have the task of catching them and bringing them back to the Kruger Park. “People from the phosphorus line and citizens are advised to stay alert at all times,” the local authorities advised.",https://www.afrinik.com/father-of-torn-child-courtney-hung-bleeding-between-jaws-of-leopard/
John William executed after lynching black man in 1998,John William executed after lynching black man in 1998,0.0,"John William “Bill” King, one of the three right-wing extremists responsible for the horrific murder of 49-year-old black James Byrd Jr., was executed yesterday. Byrd Jr. died after three white men, including King, had tied Byrd behind their truck and then dragged him along a paved road for a few kilometers. It is one of the most notorious hate crimes in recent US history.

44-year-old John William “Bill” King received a deadly injection last night at ten pasts seven in Huntsville, Texas. Just before King died, he wrote down his last words: “Capital Punishment (the death penalty, ed.): The punishment for people without capital.”

King was accused, along with Shawn Berry and Laurence Brewer, of the kidnapping of James Byrd Jr., who was walking home on June 7, 1998, from a party in Jasper, Texas. They tied Byrd to their Ford pickup truck, dragged him 5 kilometers, and then dumped his lifeless body in front of an African-American church. A lighter with engraved KKK, the abbreviation of the Ku Klux Klan, the organization known for racist violence, was one of the evidence that the police found at the crime scene.

King was found guilty of murder in 1999 and sentenced to death. He was a member of an organization of white supremacists. He had already spent time in jail before. Then he said that he wanted to start a race war. He wanted new members of his organization to kidnap black people and kill them.

Brewer, one of King’s henchmen, was executed in 2011. Berry got a life sentence. King has always held on to his innocence. He claimed he was no longer with the other two men when Byrd was murdered.

Byrd’s sister read a statement in the name of the family after attending the execution with another sister and niece: “The execution was a fair punishment for his actions,” she said, referring to the fact that Byrd had three children and four grandchildren.

King’s execution is the fourth of this year in the US. Three took place in Texas.",https://www.afrinik.com/john-william-executed-lynching-black-man-1998/

A terrible video of child abuse was unveiled on March 19 via Twitter. In the 10-second clip, a young woman is observed repeatedly kicking a baby sitting on the floor.

Another person present in the room was busy recording the scene without flinching or trying to intervene to stop the aggressor.

The video was reportedly from China and has generated outrage in social networks, especially on Twitter. Yet, some videos of the repeated cases of child abuse and animal abuse are from Asian countries.

Also, some Twitter users highlighted the precarious housing conditions while many suggest that the family is very poor. And “anger was a result of being poor.”

Similarly, recalled that China maintains a law of predilection on children, with males being more expected. In the video, it is deduced by the clothes of the baby, in pink tones, that it would be a girl.

Diabetic teen dies after prescribed oils instead of insulin — the herbalist is going to prison,Diabetic teen dies after prescribed oils instead of insulin,0.0,"Send this page to someone via email

EDITOR’S NOTE: This copy has been updated to reflect that Timothy Morrow is an herbalist, not a certified naturopath.

A California herbalist charged in the death of a diabetic 13-year-old he treated with herbs instead of insulin is heading to prison for four months.

In 2014, Timothy Morrow, a self-proclaimed “master herbalist” based in Torrance, Calif., attempted to treat Edgar Lopez for his Type-1 diabetes. Morrow told Edgar’s parent that the insulin the doctor has prescribed was poison and to rub lavender oil on Edgar’s spine instead — claiming it would cure him, according to ABC News.

At 6p -what drove two jurors to cry openly in court.@ABC7Courts pic.twitter.com/dlCxBgt8GM — Miriam Hernandez (@abc7miriam) February 7, 2019

Last week, Morrow, 84, was found guilty of one count of practising medicine without a licence. On Monday, a court sentenced him to 120 days in jail and 48 months of summary probation.

Morrow also pleaded no contest to one count of child abuse likely to produce great bodily injury or death.

What happened?

Maria Madrigal, Lopez’s mother, said she had previously attended Morrow’s seminars about herbs and alternative medicine.

During the court case, Madrigal testified that she once regarded Morrow as a specialist “like a god” and trusted him to treat her son.

Although she went to regular doctors for an annual examination and had given Edgar insulin for his diabetes, over time, she stopped and Morrow began to push his herbal products, according to ABC News.

Morrow began treating the 13-year-old for his diabetes by prescribing him herbs instead of the insulin Edgar’s doctor had prescribed.

But Edgar began to fall ill, Madrigal told the jury, and Morrow told her that her son’s pain and weight loss were not symptoms of illness, but that he was on the verge of a rebound that mainstream medicine could not deliver. She said Morrow promised that Edgar’s diabetes would be cured forever.

“He assured me that his life was not at risk,” Madrigal said.

Edgar fell extremely ill due to complications with his Type-1 diabetes in August 2014. The teenager was not eating, his eyes were fixed in place, his skin was cold and he was barely breathing. Morrow went to the family home to treat him, according to prosecutors.

Shortly before Edgar died, Morrow told his parents not to give him insulin but instead to give him the herbs he was selling, prosecutors said.

The 13-year-old died the next day.

According to ABC News, Morrow was questioned by Los Angeles police after Edgar died. In a taped interview, police asked: “Why do you think he died?”

“I have no idea, I have no idea. But they said he had a heart attack. He wasn’t having a heart attack when I saw him,” Morrow replied.

The defence blamed Edgar’s mother for the teenager’s death, saying Morrow never claimed to be a doctor or have medical credentials.

“There’s no evidence that Mr. Morrow stole Edgar’s insulin vials, no evidence he put a gun to anyone’s head, and said, ‘Give me insulin so I can destroy it,'” defence attorney Sanford Perliss told the jury.

But prosecutors said Morrow brainwashed Edgar’s mother, urging her to use herbs instead of insulin, ABC News reported.

Morrow said tumours were a ‘gift from God’

During the trial, prosecutors showed videos of Morrow (which are also on Youtube) to the jury, in which he claims “a tumour is your friend. A tumour is a gift from God.

In another video, Morrow said, “Insulin is very poisonous to the system.”

Morrow’s website, called Common Sense Herbs, says he is the founder of his company. It says Morrow was diagnosed with prostate cancer in his 40s and after “five years of unsuccessful treatments,” he started to take herbs and changed his diet, and his “cancer disappeared.”

“This case underscores the serious health and safety risks of taking medical advice from someone who lacks a license and the proper training that goes with it,” Los Angeles city attorney Mike Feuer said in a statement. “These convictions send a strong message that my office will continue to hold accountable those whose actions place lives in danger.”

On top of the prison time, the court also demanded Morrow pay a $5,000 fine, pay the family for all of Edgar’s funeral expenses, to print a clear warning label on herbs he packages for sale and to remove or withdraw all publications and videos that advocate herbs in lieu of medical advice or medicine.

Mother imprison for beating her son for calling her a “slut” [Video],Mother imprison for beating her son for calling her a “slut” [Video],0.0,"Day after day, infinity of cases of child abuse are recorded through material that in many occasions comes to be shared on social networks, as a measure to expose the abuse that happens behind the doors, as happened recently in Durango, a small city in southwestern Colorado, near the New Mexico border.

During the week, a footage that provoked the outrage of millions of internet users began to go viral, because in the clip you can see how a lady hits her 17-year-old son mercilessly, after he insulted her.

According to information circulating in the media, the beating was the consequence, after the teenager told his mother the word ‘Marrana’ (meaning “slut”), which did not do anything funny to the lady, who is identified as Nayelly N of 35-year-old.

For this reason, the woman decided to maltreat her son and beat him to near-death, all this while torturing him (for more than a minutes), telling him to apologize while on his knees. Fortunately, the video came to the hands of the Durango Prosecutor’s Office. And in coordination with the Procurator for the Protection of Children and Adolescents, they put the young boy and his two younger brothers safe.

The one who sent the footage to the authorities was the young man’s stepfather, because he got tired of the situation of violence that was lived in the home; “Thanks to him, his stepchildren are already safe and are being examined by psychologists and doctors of the Public Ministry”.

Also, it is known that the woman who was the protagonist of the recording, received a formal prison sentence for family violence and assaults, so she is now in jail.",https://www.afrinik.com/mother-imprison-for-beating-her-son-for-calling-her-a-slut-video/
Three children die after being stuck in a freezer: “No words to describe our grief”,Three children die after being stuck in a freezer: “No words to describe our grief”,0.0,"Three children were playing outside in Live Oak (Florida) yesterday when the disaster struck. The little ones had found no better than to climb into a freezer that was outside in the garden and was not connected yet. But the door closed behind them and then blocked. The children were trapped as rats and did not survive.

Two children – a boy (6) and a girl (1) – were brother and sister and lived with their grandmother. The third child was a girl (4) who lived together with her mother on the same domain.

One of the women was asleep when the children were playing outside in anticipation of her night shift. At that moment the other woman was freshening up in the bathroom. She could not find the children afterwards, after which the women began to search the domain together.

Eventually they found the children in the freezer that had recently been purchased, but had not yet been connected. The women tried to resuscitate the little ones and alerted the emergency services, but all help came too late. The children were declared dead in the hospital.

There is an investigation into the tragic deaths going on, an autopsy has yet to be carried out, according to local media. So far, the police have announced that the freezer was second-hand and that the door was blocked after the children had climbed into it. The lock would have been faulty and had not yet been repaired.

"Walker's Wisconsin win big blow to unions, smaller one to Obama",CNN projects Walker will beat back recall challenge - CNN.com,0.0,"Story highlights Gov. Scott Walker beats challenger Tom Barrett by a 53%-46% margin

Walker's margin of victory larger than 2010 race in which he also faced Barrett

Democrats spurred the recall effort over Walker's efforts to weaken public unions

Tens of millions of dollars have poured in from outside the state, mostly for Walker

In a vote that could have implications on both the November presidential race and for organized labor, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker on Tuesday successfully overcame a recall vote that would have removed him from office.

With almost all of the votes in, Walker , a Republican hero for pushing austerity measures that stripped collective bargaining rights from most public unions, led Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett by a 53-46 margin.

Tuesday's vote was the culmination of a 15-month near-civil war that pitted unions and Democratic supporters against fiscal conservatives and Republicans after Walker signed a bill in March 2011 passed by the Republican-controlled legislature that took collective bargaining rights away from public employee unions in a effort to close the state's budget gap.

Tens of thousands of demonstrators opposing Walker crowded the grounds around the state capitol and hung banners of protest in its rotunda after Walker signed the bill and kicked off a recall drive that gathered 900,000 signatures -- nearly 400,000 more than required.

During a bitter fight over the law last year, Democratic legislators left the capital to prevent a quorum.

In declaring victory on Tuesday, Walker said the outcome validated his hard line on cost-cutting.

""Tonight, we tell Wisconsin, we tell our country and we tell people all across the globe that voters really do want leaders who stand up and make the tough decisions,"" he told a roaring crowd at his campaign headquarters in Waukesha.

He also addressed the polarized climate in the normally centrist state -- his crowd jeered when he mentioned that he had a phone conversation with Barrett before taking the stage.

""Bringing our state together will take some time -- there's just no doubt about it,"" he said.

But he offered a first step by inviting members of the legislature over for bratwursts and burgers, ""and then maybe a little bit of good Wisconsin beer, as well.""

In conceding, Barrett also drew catcalls when he mentioned the call with Walker. And he said it was important that he and the governor work together.

But he urged his supporters to fight on'

""This is not an end,"" he said. ""Tonight ends another chapter in Wisconsin history but there's more to come.""

Unions pointed to Walker supporters' outspending his opponents by a more than 7-1 margin, 70% of it from outside the state.

""Adding to this gargantuan challenge of recalling only the third governor in American history was the flood of secret corporate cash distorting our democracy -- a dangerous example of a post-Citizens United America,"" AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka said in a statement after the vote, referring to the Supreme Court decision that allowed unlimited political contributions from corporations and unions.

Both parties cast the debate as a larger referendum on the role of government and policies supported by both parties.

While political pundits framed the race as a test run for the presidential election, fiscal conservatives were looking for momentum in a growing movement to curb what they see as public employee unions getting larded with benefits from politicians that they helped elect.

""(Walker's) one of the Republican governors who has been out on the point on this issue about whether there are excesses in public employee unions in terms of their pension plans or health care plans and so forth,"" CNN political analyst David Gergen said. ""This is a very, very hot issue from New York to California and from New Jersey to Indiana to Ohio to Wisconsin.

""And this election tonight was well-regarded long before by both sides as the second most important election of the year. And here Scott Walker, I must say, to a surprise, given a year ago, it looked like he was going to lose this, tonight, to win is a substantial defeat for labor, for public employee unions, and a substantial defeat -- a substantial victory for those who have been trying to curb them.""

Public opinion polls leading up to the vote had shown Walker holding a narrowing lead and early exit polls suggested the race would be tight, with 34% of those responding identifying themselves as Democrats, 35% saying they're Republicans and 31% saying they're independents.

A state official said on condition of not being identified that turnout appeared to be strong, with reports of some polling places running out of forms for same-day voter registration.

The race was a rematch of the 2010 governor's contest, won by Walker with only 52% of the vote.

But this time, the stakes were higher.

The first-term governor's win could give Republicans a major boost in efforts to make Wisconsin a battleground state in the November presidential election. It now has a strong ground operation in a state that has been remained blue since 1988.

But exit polls indicate that the vote Tuesday wasn't the presidential litmus test that many pundits suggested.

While Barrett went down to defeat, those responding to exit polls favored President Barack Obama over GOP presumptive presidential nominee Mitt Romney by a 51-44 margin. And Obama got higher marks than Romney on handling the economy by a slim margin and on helping the middle class by a wider margin.

Obama easily won the state in 2008, but Walker's unyielding commitment to fiscal austerity in the face of chaotic protests last year made him the poster child for tea party conservatism.

Walker would have been only the third governor in U.S. history ousted by a recall election.

Along with the gubernatorial recall, Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch also won her recall election.

Four Republican senators also faced recall votes Tuesday but results were not yet available. A loss of any of those four races would have tipped control of the Senate to Democrats, but with the legislature out of session until after the general election, a Democratic win would have provided mostly a moral victory.

A former Republican state senator ousted in a Wisconsin recall vote last year said Tuesday that the political wound he suffered was worth it because of the fiscal austerity achieved.

""I lost my job standing for something, and I was standing for the people, fiscal responsibility and the future of this country and the state and its residents,"" Dan Kapanke said, adding that ""the times dictate tough decisions, and we want our elected officials to do the right thing and worry about the future and not just about the next election.""

Walker complains that repeated recall efforts over past years are stalling progress and costing the state needed money.

Earlier Tuesday, Barrett said he agrees that voters are tired of recall politics, but he blamed Walker for creating a divisive political environment that inspired the effort to oust him.

""What Gov. Walker doesn't say is he was the one who, these are his words, dropped the bomb and attempted to divide and conquer. So he set out on a strategy to divide this state. He succeeded in dividing the state,"" Barrett said, adding that the proper course now is to ""get rid of the instigator rather than to allow him to continue because I think this state will remain this bitterly divided if he continues in office.""

About $64 million has been spent on the race since November, an analysis from the Center for Public Integrity found. That's a state record, shattering the record of $37.4 million spent during the 2010 governor's race.

Walker collected $30.5 million to Barrett's $4 million. Roughly two-thirds of Walker's contributions came from out of state, the Center for Public Integrity reported, while only a quarter of Barrett's funds originated from outside Wisconsin.

Barrett said Tuesday that such outside influence is a change for Wisconsin.

""What's happened is, Scott Walker has become the rock star of the far right and has been able to raise literally millions of dollars from out-of-state contributors,"" Barrett said.

During a bitter fight over the law last year, Democratic legislators left the capital to prevent a quorum, and tens of thousands of protesters converged on the State Capitol building in what became an occupation.

After the law was signed, Democrats immediately began a recall effort that led to Tuesday's vote.

Walker has defended his budget actions as necessary for the fiscal health of his state and described his campaign as one of a strong leader who is making the necessary ""tough decisions.""

The campaign has been fierce, with campaigners complaining of keyed cars, verbal harassment and a general lack of tolerance for differing opinions.

""We have an example of Hatfields and McCoys going on in this state like we have never seen,"" said Brian Nemoir, a Milwaukee-based Republican strategist. ""People are hyper-engaged, as much in support for their own candidate as in disgust for the opponent.""

Handmade signs were nearly as prevalent as official ones. Some locals say they have resorted to lowering their voices in public when discussing the recall to avoid setting off arguments with strangers.

The Justice Department on Monday dispatched federal observers to monitor Milwaukee polling places Tuesday to ensure that no voter discrimination took place.

A litany of Republican stars have campaigned for Walker, including fellow governors Chris Christie of New Jersey, Nikki Haley of South Carolina, Bobby Jindal of Louisiana and Bob McDonnell of Virginia, as well as U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio from Florida.

While Romney didn't campaign for Walker in Wisconsin, he quickly congratulated the governor after his victory.

""Governor Walker has demonstrated over the past year what sound fiscal policies can do to turn an economy around, and I believe that in November voters across the country will demonstrate that they want the same in Washington, D.C.,"" Romney said in a statement.

Americans for Prosperity, a conservative advocacy group built around many of the same principles as the tea party, has pumped more than $10 million into Wisconsin backing Walker's policies.

Barrett, meanwhile, got his own high-powered support from former President Clinton, as well as Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley.

However, his campaign fund-raising has badly trailed the support Walker received. The Progressive Change Campaign Committee announced Saturday that it was spending $100,000 in the five days before the Wisconsin recall vote, bringing its investment to $300,000.

Obama never came to Wisconsin to campaign for Barrett, which Republicans surmised was because the president believes Barrett will lose.

On Sunday, Barrett said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" that his campaign never asked Obama to appear on his behalf, adding that ""we understand he's got a lot going on.""

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney acknowledged the uniqueness of the contest while stressing there's no doubt where the president stood.

""The president's made clear all along his opposition to those who would take away workers rights -- to actions that would take away or diminish worker's rights,"" Carney said. ""And he's also made clear his support for Tom Barrett.""

Divorced couple abandoned kids in the rain on the sidewalk,Divorced couple abandoned kids in the rain on the sidewalk,0.0,"France has been startled by an extreme case of child neglect. Two boys aged 6 and 4 were left on the footpath in the Department of Aisne. The kids were just wearing pajamas and sitting in the rain. They cried. Both the father and the mother said: “they did not want to take care of them anymore,” BFM TV says so.

The harrowing event took place at the beginning of last year. When the couple from the Thierache divorced, co-parenting was agreed. But neither of them really wanted to take care of the boys.

One morning the father, in his thirties, dropped the children off at the mother before she could take action to stop him. During the course of the day, the mother tried to bring the boys back to their father, who turned out not to be home at the time.

Neighbor

The regional newspaper L’union writes that the mother dropped the children with their bags in front of the father’s House and left them in the rain. The oldest kid was still chasing the car. The two little boys then sought refuge with the neighbor who in turn informed the police. When the mother was contacted by telephone, she said that “she no longer wanted them”, just like their father.

Ping-pong

“The mother has something else to do, she works, her situation does not allow her to take care of the children in good conditions,” said the lawyer representing the children. “The father on his side does not want to take the little ones under his care either. To make sure he doesn’t have to take care of them, he told social services that he could lose the trappers and beat his kids at any time. So the parents continued to play ping-pong and the children were sent from one parent to another.”

Course

Both parents have now been sentenced to eight months in prison with a continuance. The father also has to take a course on the responsibilities of parenthood at his own expense and transfer 3,000 euros to each son. The mother received similar punishment. She has to transfer 2,000 euros to each child. The children are housed in a foster home. The parents are allowed to visit their sons for an hour a month.",https://www.afrinik.com/divorced-couple-abandoned-kids-rain-the-sidewalk/

Less than 30 minutes before the show, Ettore Weber was crushed between the jaws of four Tigers.

Circo Marina Monti Orfei, as the circus is called, Where Weber performed with his big cats, arrived on June 15 in Bari in the southeast of Italy. The 61-year-old predator inhibitor, known as one of the largest in the trade, was supposed to exhibit its arts until July 14, but the striped foursome clearly had a different opinion.

With half an hour to go, Ettore rehearsed Thursday’s show. However, one of the Tigers knocked him to the ground, after which the other three dived on top of him. Weber tried to free himself from the grasp of the tigers, but they didn’t give him a chance. They bit him to death and tore him to pieces.

According to La Gazzetta del Mezzogiorno, Webers’ colleagues tried to drive the animals away but in vain. In addition, eyewitnesses used fire extinguishers, but they did not do much good either. In front of the helpless circus workers, the animals played with Webers’ mutilated bodies for at least half an hour.

Only when the Tigers were back in their cages, and all the help was too late, could one get to the lifeless dullard. Paramedics found Weber succumbed to a series of serious injuries, including his spine. The circus world is shocked by his death.

Thousands of barrels of Jim Beam bourbon burn in Kentucky warehouse fire,Thousands of barrels of Jim Beam bourbon burn in Kentucky warehouse fire,0.0,"Versailles, Ky. — A massive fire destroyed a Jim Beam warehouse in northern Kentucky on Wednesday, but officials said no one was injured. Firefighters were working to extinguish the blaze at a warehouse in Versailles, which is filled with about 45,000 barrels of bourbon.

Two barrel warehouses caught fire late Tuesday night. One warehouse initially caught fire with flames spreading to the second structure, Drew Chandler of Woodford County Emergency Management told CBS Lexington, Kentucky, affiliate WLKY-TV.

Crews were able to put one out, but the other kept burning for hours. Chandler said it may have been caused by lightning.

Who were the 157 people who died in plane crash in Ethiopia?,Who were the 157 people who died in plane crash in Ethiopia?,0.0,"Who were the 157 people who died in plane crash in Ethiopia?

Yesterday morning, the Boeing 737 with onboard 149 passengers and eight crew members crashed in Addis Ababa. The plane rose in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa and should land in Nairobi (Kenya). But six minutes after takeoff, the plane from Ethiopian Airlines collapsed. All 157 people onboard, with 35 different nationalities, lost their lives.

A few hours after the crash, Ethiopian Airlines released a list listing the different nationalities. On board were: 1 Belgian, 32 Kenyans, 18 Canadians, 9 Ethiopians, 8 Chinese, 8 Italians, 8 Americans, 7 British, 7 French, 6 Egyptians, 5 Germans, 4 Slovakians, 4 Indians, 3 Austrians, 3 Russians, 3 Sweden, 2 Spaniards, 2 Moroccans, 2 Israelis, 2 Poles, 1 Indonesian, 1 Irishman, 1 Ugandan, 1 Rwandan, 1 Yemenite, 1 Saudi, 1 Sudanese, 1 Somalian, 1 Togolese, 1 Mozambican, 1 Serbian, 1 Norwegian, 1 Nepali, 1 Nigerian and 1 person with a passport from the United Nations.

The Belgian on board of the plane was Ghislaine De Claremont, a woman of 60 from the Walloon Brabant Rebecq. She worked as a personal banker at ING and had become a fourth-time grandmother last month.

Not surprisingly, most passengers had the Kenyan nationality, after all, the aircraft had Nairobi as its final destination. Among them are men, women, and children.

Canadians

Furthermore, there were also strikingly many Canadians on the plane. One of them was Pius Adesanmi, an English Literature professor at Carleton University in Ottawa. “He was an inspiring figure and an important figurehead in African and postcolonial science,” says Benoit-Antoine Bacon, dean of the university. Many statements of support followed through social media.

“Prof. Pius Adesanmi made the IAS at Carleton home, for me and many African students in Ottawa. We went to his office without setting up appointments. And he took all of us seriously. He wanted to know our dreams and ambitions. He told us we were capable of great things,” writes Halima

In addition, Amina Ibrahim Odowaa and Safiya Faisal Ega, mother, and daughter were onboard the plane. They migrated to Canada in 2006 and were on their way to Kenya to visit family.

UN delegation

The 24-year-old Danielle Moore, of Canadian descent, was part of the UN delegation on board the aircraft. Joanne Toole also flew in function of the UN. The 36-year-old Toole came from Great Britain and mainly worked around the protection of the oceans. Michael (Mick) Ryan was an Irish engineer who worked for the UN food program. He had a wife and two children.

And so another 16, connected to the United Nations (UN), flew in the direction of Nairobi. Both Addis Ababa and Nairobi are important destinations for humanitarian organizations. Moreover, a climate conference is starting in Nairobi today.

Peter deMarsh, from Canada, was on his way to that climate conference. He was chairman of the International Family Forestry Alliance (IFFA). He would attend a conference in Nairobi on private forests in Kenya.

Italian envoys

Poalo Dieci is one of the eight Italians who perished in the plane crash. He was a human rights lawyer and traveled just like Danielle Moore, Joanne Toole, and Irish Michael (Mick) Ryan, in function of the United Nations. In addition, the Italian Sebastiano Tusa (66) also died during the crash. He was an underwater archaeologist and chairman of the human rights organization CISP. He would attend a conference of UNESCO in Nairobi.

Two of the four Slovakians who traveled to Nairobi were relatives of politician Anton Hrnko. The man lost his wife and son.

The two lovebirds always agreed on dying together. But why they terminate their precious life is still weird and left thousands of questions.

The case was very outrageous and to anyone that comes across the story around the world. Love, affection and understanding are just some of the things that grandparents or older adults can offer to anyone who pays them a little attention. However, it seems that not everyone believes the same, because for some it is a nuisance to have to take care of them.

Such is the case that happened in Chile, where an elderly couple, grandparents who had married for more than 60 years and lived together, decided to take their own lives with a firearm because, according to local media, they were tired of living, having to be a burden for their family and relatives.

Jose Aedo (94) and his wife, Blanca Saez (86) both commit suicide

Local authorities indicated that the deceased were identified as Jose Aedo (94) years old, and his wife, Blanca Saez (86). They lived in the municipality of El Bosque, located in Santiago. Before they commit suicide, the grandparents left a letter in which the following text could be read: “We made the decision to take our own lives because we are tired of living and being financially dependent on our family. In addition, Blanca is very sick.”

The grandparents had four children and seven grandchildren, one of them was the one who found the bodies lying on the bed and explained that his grandparents ‘loved each other and always said they were going to be together’.

The first investigations indicate that Jose Aedo was the one who fired at his partner; he lay down next to his beloved, took the revolver and shot himself in the head.

So far, the relatives have not issued any statement.",https://www.afrinik.com/avoid-burden-family-grandparents-commit-suicide/

"Texas has highest maternal mortality rate in developed world, study finds","Texas has highest maternal mortality rate in developed world, study finds",0.0,"The rate of Texas women who died from complications related to pregnancy doubled from 2010 to 2014, a new study has found, for an estimated maternal mortality rate that is unmatched in any other state and the rest of the developed world.



The finding comes from a report, appearing in the September issue of the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology, that the maternal mortality rate in the United States increased between 2000 and 2014, even while the rest of the world succeeded in reducing its rate. Excluding California, where maternal mortality declined, and Texas, where it surged, the estimated number of maternal deaths per 100,000 births rose to 23.8 in 2014 from 18.8 in 2000 – or about 27%.

But the report singled out Texas for special concern, saying the doubling of mortality rates in a two-year period was hard to explain “in the absence of war, natural disaster, or severe economic upheaval”.

From 2000 to the end of 2010, Texas’s estimated maternal mortality rate hovered between 17.7 and 18.6 per 100,000 births. But after 2010, that rate had leaped to 33 deaths per 100,000, and in 2014 it was 35.8. Between 2010 and 2014, more than 600 women died for reasons related to their pregnancies.

No other state saw a comparable increase.

In the wake of the report, reproductive health advocates are blaming the increase on Republican-led budget cuts that decimated the ranks of Texas’s reproductive healthcare clinics. In 2011, just as the spike began, the Texas state legislature cut $73.6m from the state’s family planning budget of $111.5m. The two-thirds cut forced more than 80 family planning clinics to shut down across the state. The remaining clinics managed to provide services – such as low-cost or free birth control, cancer screenings and well-woman exams – to only half as many women as before.

At the same time, Texas eliminated all Planned Parenthood clinics – whether or not they provided abortion services – from the state program that provides poor women with preventive healthcare. Previously, Planned Parenthood clinics in Texas offered cancer screenings and contraception to more than 130,000 women.

In 2013, Texas restored funding for the family planning budget to original levels. But the healthcare providers who survived the initial cuts reported struggles to restore services to their original levels.

Indeed, the report said it was “puzzling” that Texas’s maternal mortality rate rose only modestly from 2000 to 2010 before doubling between 2011 and 2012. The researchers, hailing from the University of Maryland, Boston University’s school of public health and Stanford University’s medical school, called for further study. But they noted that starting in 2011, Texas drastically reduced the number of women’s health clinics within its borders.

The report comes just as public health advocates are raising questions about Texas’s ability to prepare for the Zika virus, which is transmitted by a common species of mosquito and has been linked to severe birth defects. The World Health Organization has advised women in areas of local transmission to delay pregnancy.

Texas is one of several southern states where health officials say there is a risk of a local outbreak. But about half the state lacks ready access to OB-GYN care, making it difficult for women to obtain contraception or for pregnant women to confirm the health of their babies. Just this month, Texas’s health department drew fire for allocating $1.6m of the $18m the state budgets for low-income women’s family planning to an anti-abortion group that does not provide basic health services.

"World on course to run out of water, warns Ban Ki-moon","World on course to run out of water, warns Ban Ki-moon | Environment",0.0,"Ban Ki-moon has warned the world is on course to run out of freshwater unless greater efforts are made to improve water security.

Speaking on the UN's International Day of Biological Diversity, Ban said there was a ""mutually reinforcing"" relationship between biodiversity and water that should be harnessed.

""We live in an increasingly water insecure world where demand often outstrips supply and where water quality often fails to meet minimum standards. Under current trends, future demands for water will not be met,"" Ban said.

Water, food, energy and climate are all linked.

Most forms of energy generation require water, variable weather is making agriculture harder while extreme weather events are hindering natural water storage.

Ban believes there is an opportunity to address these challenges as the Millennium Development Goals are replaced with a new set of objectives.

""As the international community strives to accelerate its efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and define a post-2015 agenda, including a set of goals for sustainable development, water and biodiversity are important streams in the discussion.

""Although seemingly abundant, only a tiny amount of the water on our planet is easily available as freshwater,"" he said.

The latest UN World Water Development Report, released last year, called for $13.7bn to $19.2bn of the Green Climate Fund's annual targeted funding of $100bn to be directed at the challenges faced by the water sector.

Much of this would be used to tackle supply shortfalls and flood management.

Climate change is already impacting the availability of water through rainfall disruption, soil moisture, glacier, snow and ice melt and river, ground and water flows.

Ban said the once competing campaigns for water and biodiversity protection could now be turned to the benefit of societies facing stresses on both water and food security.

""Where once the focus was on trade-offs between water use and biodiversity, today we are coming to understand how biodiversity and water security are mutually reinforcing,"" he said.

""Ecosystems influence the local, regional and global availability and quality of water. Forests help regulate soil erosion and protect water quality and supply. Wetlands can reduce flood risks. Soil biodiversity helps maintain water for crops.

""Integrating nature-based solutions into urban planning can also help us build better water futures for cities, where water stresses may be especially acute given the rapid pace of urbanization.""",http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2013/may/22/world-run-out-water-ban-ki-moon1
'Worse than AIDS' - sex 'superbug' discovered in Japan called disaster in waiting,'Worse than AIDS' - untreatable sex 'superbug' discovered in Japan called disaster in waiting,0.0,"Doctors are warning that a drug-resistant strain of gonorrhea could be more deadly than AIDS, and are urging members of US Congress to spend $54 million for the development of a drug that would fight it.

""This might be a lot worse than AIDS in the short run because the bacteria is more aggressive and will affect more people quickly,"" Alan Christianson, a doctor of naturopathic medicine, told CNBC.

The new strain of gonorrhea, H041, was first discovered in 2009 after a sex worker fell victim to the superbug in Japan. Medical officials reported that the medication-resilient ‘sex superbug’ was discovered in Hawaii in May 2011, and has since spread to California and Norway, the International Business Times reports.

Nearly 30 million people die from AIDS-related causes each year, and the H041 superbug could have similar consequences, according to Alan Christianson, a doctor of naturopathic medicine.

""Getting gonorrhea from this strain might put someone into septic shock and death in a matter of days,"" Christianson said. ""This is very dangerous.""

The gonorrhea strain has not yet claimed any lives, but the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have asked Congress for $54 million to find an antibiotic to treat the strain.

In a Capitol Hill briefing last week, health officials said an education and public awareness campaign is crucial in minimizing the effective of HO41. William Smith, executive director of the National Coalition for STD Directors, said that if the ‘sex superbug’ spreads, it could quickly kill many people before a treatment is discovered. And that risk becomes increasingly more likely if Congress does not provide the funds to find a cure, he said.

""It's an emergency situation. As time moves on, it's getting more hazardous,"" he told members of Congress.

""We have to keep beating the drum on this,"" he added. ""The potential for disaster is great.""

In the United States, there are 20 million new STD infections each year, which results in about $16 billion in medical costs, the CDC reports. More than 800,000 of these cases gonorrhea infections, most of which occur in young people ages 15 to 24. Gonorrhea is sometimes difficult to detect, since it shows no symptoms in about half of all women. Those who fall ill to the deadly strain may not notice it until it’s too late.

“That’s what’s kind of scary about this,” Smith said.

Although health officials have widely reported that cases of H041 were discovered in California, Hawaii and Norway, the CDC has disputed those claims and told CNBC on Monday that the infection has not been confirmed anywhere outside of Japan. The CDC did, however, make an announcement in 2011 that it was noticing greater gonorrhea bacterial resistance to certain types of antibiotics in Hawaii and California.

CDC officials said that the US and Norwegian cases were treated effectively with antibiotics not routinely recommended and that these cases were mistakenly identified as H041. But the agency continues to urge Congress for research funding, indicating that the risk of infection is high regardless of where the cases occurred.

Christianson is urging people to practice safe sex and get STD tests if they are in a new relationship, since a superbug infection could be around the corner.

""This is a disaster just waiting to happen,"" he told CNBC. ""It's time to do something about it before it explodes. These superbugs, including the gonorrhea strain, are a health threat. We need to move now before it gets out of hand.""",http://rt.com/news/superbug-gonorrhea-aids-sex-900/
Another Federally-Backed Solar Energy Project Just Went Belly-Up,Another Federally-Backed Solar Energy Project Just Went Belly-Up,0.0,"It wasn't the first and won't be the last.

Looks like another federally backed solar energy plant has gone bust. Bloomberg News reports, “A $1 Billion Solar Plant Was Obsolete Before It Ever Went Online.”

In 2011 the $1 billion [Crescent Dunes] project was to be the biggest solar plant of its kind, and it looked like the future of renewable power. Citigroup Inc. and other financiers invested $140 million with its developer, SolarReserve Inc. Steven Chu, the U.S. Department of Energy secretary at the time, offered the company [$737 million in] government loan guarantees, and Harry Reid, then the Senate majority leader and senior senator from Nevada, cleared the way for the company to build on public land.

The state of Nevada chipped in another $119.3 million tax abatements over 20 years. But, Chris Martin and Nic Querolo write at Bloomberg,

By the time the plant opened in 2015, the increased efficiency of cheap solar panels had already surpassed its technology, and today it’s obsolete — the latest panels can pump out power at a fraction of the cost for decades with just an occasional hosing‐​down.… The plant’s technology was designed to generate enough power night and day to supply a city the size of nearby Sparks, Nev. (population 100,000), but it never came close. Its power cost NV about $135 per megawatt‐​hour, compared with less than $30 per MWh today at a new Nevada photovoltaic solar farm, according to BloombergNEF, which researches fossil fuel alternatives.

It all reminds me of another giant taxpayer‐​funded failure of the Obama administration’s green‐​energy enthusiasm, Solyndra. Visiting the Solyndra solar‐​panel factory in Fremont, California, in May 2010, President Obama declared, “The true engine of economic growth will always be companies like Solyndra.” But despite $535 million in federal loan guarantees, Solyndra declared bankruptcy 16 months later.

Plenty of people in and around the Obama administration genuinely believed that fossil fuels were dangerous and unsustainable. But as I wrote in 2018 in American Consequences magazine,

when governments pick winners, politics usually rears its ugly head. Official investigations and reporters dug into the story and found that, as the Washington Post reported, “Obama’s green‐​technology program was infused with politics at every level… Political considerations were raised repeatedly by company investors, Department of Energy bureaucrats and White House officials.” The family funds of Oklahoma billionaire George Kaiser, a big Obama fundraiser, owned a third of Solyndra. As the company was failing, Kaiser wrote to a Solyndra board member, “Why don’t you pursue your contacts with the WH?” Two months later the board member wrote Kaiser, “The DOE really thinks politically before it thinks economically.” Solyndra’s lobbyists met at least three times with an aide to top White House official Valerie Jarrett.

Government subsidies can bring any business into existence. But apparently even subsidies can’t ensure the production of something useful.

No abortion: 11-year-old raped girl gives birth to a baby,Argentine govt prohibit abortion: 11-year-old raped girl gives birth to a baby,0.0,"In Argentina, an 11-year-old girl gave birth after being raped. She had to, because the government refused an abortion, despite several requests from her mother and human rights activists to remove the fetus. Eventually, she underwent a cesarean section: “Horror for an 11-year-old child.”

Lucia, an 11-year-old Argentinian girl, was 24 weeks pregnant when doctors decided to allow her to give birth to her baby via cesarean section. The baby was about the size of a corncob (30 centimeters) and had a small chance of survival, but considering Lucia’s young age and guaranteeing her safety, there was not much else.

Suicide Five weeks ago, doctors at the Eva Peron hospital in northern Argentina discovered that the 11-year-old girl had been pregnant for 19 weeks. And the doctors were not only stunned by her young age. After all, Lucia was brought to the hospital for a reason other than her pregnancy: she had severe cuts on her arms that suggested insinuating suicide.

Old man

Lucia wanted “the thing that the old man put into me” disappeared. After all, her pregnancy was the result of repeated abuse. And the old man that Lucia was referring to was the 65-year-old partner of her grandmother. Her grandmother received custody three years ago over Lucia and her two older sisters after being abused by their mother’s friend.

Because the girl was only 11 years old, and because her pregnancy was the result of rape, the doctors, human rights activists, and Lucia’s mother worked hard for an abortion. The Argentine press also mixed and reported extensively about the tragic fate of Lucia.

Argentine abortion

But despite the great interest, the request for an abortion was denied again and again by the Argentine government.

In Argentina, abortion is strictly forbidden. However, there are two exceptions when the pregnancy is the result of rape, or when the woman’s own safety is compromised by pregnancy. In the 11-year-old girl, both exceptions applied, but she was not allowed to commit an abortion.

I want the thing that the old man put in me Lucia, a victim of rape

Victim of the election battle

A political move according to the doctor who eventually carried out the early cesarean section: “That girl is the victim of an election battle. She was used for recruiting votes.” Human rights activists also denounce the power of politicians who determine whether or not a woman can commit an abortion.

On the other side are the resistance fighters who are strongly opposed to abortion. Among them also Carlos Alberto Sanchez: the archbishop in Tucuman, the Argentinean province where Lucia lives. He does not only speak strict about the abortion but also revealed the true identity of Lucia who was kept secret by the press.

“Both lives” could be saved according to the archbishop. “That defenseless creature was ripped out of his mother’s womb when it was only 24 weeks old and premature. Now it is there with tubes and little chance of survival. If the pregnancy had lasted twenty days longer, both the mother and the child could have lived,” added an Argentine journalist via a Twitter message.

He continues: “I do not care about the attacks against me. The photo is obvious that it was downloaded from the Internet. How much do you bother seeing a baby in a critical situation? More morbid is killing the innocent and dehumanizing people. It is representative of the situation that this baby girl is going through.”

“#Abortionists, there they have their trophy … Happy? What kind of humanity do they have?”

“#ImpunityGreen: I pray for that baby, for that mom and for you too.”

Ese ser humano indefenso e inocente es a quién los abortistas lograron arrancar del vientre de su mamá en Tucumán. 24 semanas y prematuro.

The endless cycle of bad news can be bad for your health,The endless cycle of bad news can be bad for your health,0.0,"We live in a culture of near-constant outrage, thanks to the Internet. You know the drill: Someone makes an offhand comment and suddenly every blog is publishing a diatribe about how unacceptable the remark was because “it’s 201X.” Writing and reading these articles can serve a greater good to society by calling out problematic ideas. But here’s something else to be outraged about: They may do more harm than good to our physical health.

Negative emotions, stress in particular, cause our bodies to break down over time. Research finds that dwelling on the endless cycle of bad news about the latest wars, terrorist attacks, and other tragedies can cause us to feel stress, leading our bodies to produce cortisol, the hormone behind the nasty effects of stress. If we’re constantly feeling stress—whether its from our families or the 2016 election cycle—slowly we will find that our immune system doesn’t work as well. This leads to a host of health problems.

Heidi Hanna, author of Stressaholic and CEO of the stress management group Synergy, told the Daily Dot she thinks we may even be hooked on stress. “I believe that outrage and becoming overly connected to bad news is an addiction based on the fact that most people are exhausted, lonely, or bored and looking for stimulation to help lift their mood and energy,” Hanna wrote in an email.

She explained that when we feel acute stress—the immediate reaction to something bad—our brain gets a little squirt of dopamine to turn our attention onto whatever is stressing us out. And that’s good in the short term—say, if you’re about to walk in front of a car while crossing the street. But with a constant barrage of work, bills, kids, and negative news, the sources of stress are hitting us from all angles. All that dopamine—the brain chemical associated with reward, pleasure, and addiction (among many other things)—may get us addicted to that stress, Hanna said. Since consuming more negative news is only as difficult as pulling out your smartphone or opening your laptop, it’s easy to get another “fix.”

Michelle Gielan, former CBS News anchor and author of the book Broadcasting Happiness agrees that Internet outrage culture may be causing us harm. She cited her own survey (conducted in collaboration with the Huffington Post) which found people who viewed three minutes of negative news were 27 percent more likely to report having a bad day six to eight hours later than people who viewed three minutes of solutions-focused news that concentrated on ways people overcome adversity.

“The web and social media can make us think that things are a bigger deal than they are,” Gielan told the Daily Dot in a phone interview. “It doesn’t make for an environment that I think can contribute to stress reduction and overall happiness.”

Gielan would like to see the news cycle shift toward promoting more solutions-focused news instead of just unflinching coverage of the negative events that happen over the globe. By seeing stories about people overcoming life’s challenges, she thinks it inspires us to feel a greater sense of control over our lives.

In a sense, media that make us feel outrage arguably does just that: By calling out a problem, they are pointing to a solution (even if the solution is just changing how we think). But Gielan was not convinced by the theory that awareness alone is leading to solutions and cited the ongoing debate about gun control to prevent mass shootings in the U.S. as an example. “It’s just noise,” she said. “It’s not furthering public discussion. It’s not fueling progress. It’s not educating people, it’s just a whole bunch of noise.”

The Huffington Post recently published a story on how the authorities in Austin, Texas, have gone to great lengths to prevent mass shootings. that story presented a solution, Gielan said.

The more time we spend focused on particular stressors in our life—whether it’s politics or a stressful situation at work or home—the more those sources of stress take over our life and become our world, these experts warn. The good news, however, is that if we refocus our energy, we can devote our attention to the things that really fuel us.

"Climate change: human disaster looms, claims new research","Climate change: human disaster looms, claims new research | Environment",0.0,"Some of the most extreme predictions of global warming are unlikely to materialise, new scientific research has suggested, but the world is still likely to be in for a temperature rise of double that regarded as safe.

The researchers said warming was most likely to reach about 4C above pre-industrial levels if the past decade's readings were taken into account.

That would still lead to catastrophe across large swaths of the Earth, causing droughts, storms, floods and heatwaves, and drastic effects on agricultural productivity leading to secondary effects such as mass migration.

Some climate change sceptics have suggested that because the highest global average temperature yet recorded was in 1998 climate change has stalled. The new study, which is published in the journal Nature Geoscience, shows a much longer ""pause"" would be needed to suggest that the world was not warming rapidly.

Alexander Otto, at the University of Oxford, lead author of the research, told the Guardian that there was much that climate scientists could still not fully factor into their models. He said most of the recent warming had been absorbed by the oceans but this would change as the seas heat up. The thermal expansion of the oceans is one of the main factors behind current and projected sea level rises.

The highest global average temperature ever recorded was in 1998, under the effects of a strong El Niño, a southern Pacific weather system associated with warmer and stormy weather, which oscillates with a milder system called La Niña. Since then the trend of average global surface temperatures has shown a clear rise above the long-term averages – the 10 warmest years on record have been since 1998 – but climate sceptics have claimed that this represents a pause in warming.

Otto said that this most recent pattern could not be taken as evidence that climate change has stopped. ""Given the noise in the climate and temperature system, you would need to see a much longer period of any pause in order to draw the conclusion that global warming was not occurring,"" he said. Such a period could be as long as 40 years of the climate record, he said.

Otto said the study found that most of the climate change models used by scientists were ""pretty accurate"". A comprehensive global study of climate change science is expected to be published in September by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, its first major report since 2007.

Jochem Marotzke, professor at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg and a co-author of the paper, said: ""It is important not to over-interpret a single decade, given what we know, and don't know, about natural climate variability. Over the past decade the world as a whole has continued to warm but the warming is mostly in the subsurface oceans rather than at the surface.""

Other researchers also warned that there was little comfort to be taken from the new estimates – greenhouse gas emissions are rising at a far higher rate than had been predicted by this stage of the 21st century and set to rise even further, so estimates for how much warming is likely will also have to be upped.

Richard Allan, reader in climate at the University of Reading, said: ""This work has used observations to estimate Earth's current heating rate and demonstrate that simulations of climate change far in the future seem to be pretty accurate. However, the research also indicates that a minority of simulations may be responding more rapidly towards this overall warming than the observations indicate.""

He said the effect of pollutants in the atmosphere, which reflect the sun's heat back into space, was particularly hard to measure.

He noted the inferred sensitivity of climate to a doubling of carbon dioxide concentrations based on this new study, suggesting a rise of 1.2C to 3.9C, was consistent with the range from climate simulations of 2.2C to 4.7C. He said: ""With work like this our predictions become ever better.""",http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2013/may/19/climate-change-meltdown-unlikely-research
"Tar sands exploitation would mean game over for climate, warns leading scientist","Tar sands exploitation would mean game over for climate, warns leading scientist | Environment",0.0,"Major international oil companies are buying off governments, according to the world's most prominent climate scientist, Prof James Hansen. During a visit to London, he accused the Canadian government of acting as the industry's tar sands salesman and ""holding a club"" over the UK and European nations to accept its ""dirty"" oil.

""Oil from tar sands makes sense only for a small number of people who are making a lot of money from that product,"" he said in an interview with the Guardian. ""It doesn't make sense for the rest of the people on the planet. We are getting close to the dangerous level of carbon in the atmosphere and if we add on to that unconventional fossil fuels, which have a tremendous amount of carbon, then the climate problem becomes unsolvable.""

Hansen met ministers in the UK government, which the Guardian previously revealed has secretly supported Canada's position at the highest level.

Canada's natural resources minister, Joe Oliver, has also visited London to campaign against EU proposals to penalise oil from Alberta's tar sands as highly polluting. ""Canada can offer energy security and economic stability to the world,"" he said. Oliver also publicly threatened a trade war via the World Trade Organisation if the EU action went ahead: ""Canada will not hesitate to defend its interests.""

The lobbying for and against tar sands has intensified on both sides of the Atlantic as the EU moves forward on its proposals, which Canada fears could set a global precedent, and Barack Barack Obama considers approving the Keystone XL pipeline to transport tar sands oil from Canada to the US gulf coast refineries and ports. Canada's prime minister, Stephen Harper, was met by protesters when he visited New York last week to tell audiences that KXL ""absolutely needs to go ahead"".

Canada's tar sands are the third biggest oil reserve in the world, but separating the oil from the rock is energy intensive and causes three to four times more carbon emissions per barrel than conventional oil. Hansen argues that it would be ""game over"" for the climate if tar sands were fully exploited, given that existing conventional oil and gas is certain to be burned.

""To leave our children with a manageable situation, we need to leave the unconventional fuel in the ground,"" he said. Canada's ministers were ""acting as salesmen for those people who will gain from the profits of that industry,"" he said. ""But I don't think they are looking after the rights and wellbeing of the population as a whole.

""The thing we are facing overall is that the fossil fuel industry has so much money that they are buying off governments,"" Hansen said. ""Our democracies are seriously handicapped by the money that is driving decisions in Washington and other capitals.""

The EU aims to penalise oil sources with higher carbon footprints, as part of a drive to reduce the carbon emissions from transport called the fuel quality directive (FDQ). But Canada, supported by the UK, is fiercely opposed: ""We are not saying they should not move to reduce emissions,"" said Oliver. ""But the proposed implementation of the FQD is discriminatory to oil sands and not based on scientific facts."" However, Europe's commissioner for climate action, Connie Hedegaard, said the FQD was ""nothing more, nothing less"" than accurate labelling and putting a fair price on pollution.

Hansen, who informed the US Congress of the danger of global warming in 1988, has caused controversy before by saying the ""CEOs of fossil fuel companies should be tried for high crimes against humanity"" and calling coal-fired power plants ""factories of death"". In April, he stepped down from his Nasa position after 46 years, in order to spend more time communicating the risks of climate change and to work on legal challenges to governments.

Hansen has started a science programme at Columbia University, the first task of which is to produce a report to support suits filed again the US federal government and several state governments. It is being pursued by the Our Children's Trust charity and is based on a trust principle recognised in US law.

""We maintain that the atmosphere and climate are held in trust by the present generations for the future generations and we do not have the right to destroy that asset,"" Hansen said. ""Therefore the courts should require the government to give a plan as to how they are going to ensure that we still have that asset to pass on to the next generation.""",http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2013/may/19/tar-sands-exploitation-climate-scientist
Father and son among six arrested over sick Grenfell Tower bonfire video,Father and son among six arrested over sick Grenfell Tower bonfire video,0.0,"A father and son are among six men being questioned by police about the burning of a model of Grenfell Tower.

Bobbi Connell, 19, was named by his grandfather, who said he was ”utterly shocked” to see him in the video posted online.

His grandfather David Connell said: “It’s an appalling thing to do given the tragic loss of life.”

Fury: Bobbi Connell, 19, and father Cliff handed themselves in

He told MailOnline: “It’s in dreadfully bad taste and utterly shocking, and I don’t condone it at all. I don’t know what they were thinking. What were they doing?”

The film was apparently shot in the back garden of the house that the father and son are believed to share in South Norwood, where there is an England flag on a pole.

'Disgusting': viewers of the clip have been left outraged

Police searched the address on Tuesday afternoon, and were seen carrying evidence bags inside.

Aerial images of the property appeared to show charred patches of grass along with an England flag lying across the rear of the garden.

Officers were also spotted rifling through bins outside the home.

A neighbour said dozens of people arrived for the bonfire before leaving the party at around 9.30pm on Saturday. He said: “It was a big fire, that’s all I could see from my garden. I had no idea it was a Grenfell effigy …. The family were there with kids and men drinking and letting off fireworks.

The neighbour, 77, added: “They have an England flag flying all year round so I guess you can say they are committed to their national identity. We are in shock and it’s a disgusting thing to do. No rational person would do that.”

Another member of the five is believed to be Paul Bussetti. His family said today they were scared for their safety after the joke “got out of hand” after “a few too many drinks”.

A close relative told the news website: “We’re in so much danger now. They didn’t want it to go this far. It’s not what it was. They are not racist. It’s been blown out of proportion.”

The men handed themselves in at a police station late last night and were arrested on suspicion of a public order offence. They were interviewed by detectives from the Operation Northleigh investigation into the Grenfell Tower fire.

The offence they are suspected of committing covers intentional “harassment, alarm or distress” caused via the use of “threatening, abusive or insulting” words or signs.

Spain BANS UK tourists from buying common painkiller after it is linked to the death of ten Brits,Spain BANS UK tourists from buying common painkiller after it is linked to the death of ten Brits,0.0,"Spanish authorities have banned doctors from prescribing a common painkiller to UK tourists, after the drug was linked to the deaths of ten Britons.

Nolotil, a painkiller not licensed for use in the UK, is prescribed for mild pain, such as toothaches and muscular discomfort, and a very rare side effect of the drug is blood poisoning.

However, Spanish investigators found fatal blood poisoning caused by Nolotil to be more frequent among British patients, due to an undefined 'genetic peculiarity'.

Bad medicine: Spanish doctors have been told to no longer prescribe Nolotil to British tourists as it's been linked to several deaths by blood poisoning

The Spanish Agency of Medicines and Medical Devices (AEMPS) has now updated its guidelines for Nolotil, telling doctors not to prescribe it to 'those visiting Spain for a short time', The Local reports.

An investigation by AEMPS was able to confirm ten deaths by British patients who had been prescribed Nolotil while visiting Spain.

WHERE IS NOLOTIL PRESCRIBED? AND WHERE IS IT BANNED? Nolotil can be prescribed for mild pain relief in: Spain

Portugal It is banned in: The UK

The US

Sweden

Japan

Australia

Most of the EU It is available over-the-counter in: Mexico

India

Brazil

Russia Advertisement

All ten cases confirmed by AEMPS involved patients contracting agranulocytosis, a very rare side effect which investigators said may be more common in Britons.

Agranulocytosis is defined as severely low white blood cell counts, which are involved in the immune system, and can lead to sepsis: blood poisoning.

While the 'genetic peculiarity' cited by AEMPS has not been specified, it has previously been reported that people with fair skin are more likely to be affected.

Some of the reported British deaths include the parents of Gary Robson, 59, from Romford, Essex, who believes both his mother and father died as a result of taking Nolotil.

His mother Gloria, 81, was prescribed Nolotil for back pain while in Spain earlier this year, and later suffered a fatal brain bleed, and his father Alan, 82, died while taking the drug in 2017.

The manufacturer of Nolotil, Boehringer Ingelheim, told the Local that 'the drug is available in many generic forms in Spain and other European countries and there is no scientific evidence that specific populations are prone to develop side effects.'

"New Look set to close 100 stores putting more than 1,000 jobs at risk","New Look set to close 100 stores putting more than 1,000 jobs at risk",0.0,"NEW Look has announced it will close nearly 100 stores as it struggles to stay on the high street, potentially putting more than 1,600 jobs at risk.

The clothing chain had planned to only shut 60 stores but today it increased the number to 85.

2 New Look is struggling to stay on the high street as plans to close 85 stores are announced Credit: Alamy

There are also talks of shutting a further 6 or 7 shops as well, and 26 stores are currently trading ""rent-free"", which means they could close at any time by landlords or New Look.

The planned store closures could put as many as 1,600 jobs axed.

The company first announced 60 shop closures in March which would see 980 jobs lost.

The firm proposed something called a Company Voluntary Agreement (CVA), which will allow it to restructure the business and pay down its debts.

2 A further 15 stores will close in addition to plas announced in March to close 60, New Look has revealed today Credit: Alamy

The new strategy seems to be working as the company today reported a profit of £22.2 million for the first half of this year, compared to a loss of £10.4million for the same period last year.

But sales have continued to fall by 3.7 per cent, with revenue slumping by 4.2 per cent to £656.9million.

Executive chairman Alistair McGeorge said today that 85 stores will definitely close after negotiations with landlords.

It's not yet clear where the additional 15 stores will be closing but The Sun has asked New Look for a list and we will update this story when we hear back.

Recent analysis by the Labour party showed there are 100,000 fewer Brits working in the retail industry than there were in 2015.

Last year alone, the high street lost a total of 1,800 shops.

Companies blame the rise of Amazon and other online shopping sites for driving footfall away from town centres.

Labour also points to price-gouging by town centre car parking firms, and to look into shops being left empty by landlords. Meanwhile the Liberal Democrats want to abolish business rates and replace them with a tax on the value of land. Influential Tories are calling on Chancellor Philip Hammond to fast-track a 3 per cent tax on the likes of Amazon, eBay and Google to “level the playing field” with UK business and help the high street.

New Look has said it will also close all 148 of its stores in China.

The business has made £70million of savings this year, but it hopes to save another £8million.

Mr McGeorge warned that conditions on the high street are still challenging.

He said: ""We continue to work hard to accelerate our progress, but we are facing into significant headwinds and uncertainties, including Brexit.

""Clearly the wider retail environment remains challenging and we are not expecting that to change anytime soon.

""However, we are on the right track and continue to drive further efficiencies across the business.""

Lion Air crash: black boxes reveal plane had airspeed problems on last four flights,Lion Air crash: black boxes reveal plane had airspeed problems on last four flights,0.0,"Data from one of the black boxes retrieved from the Lion Air plane that crashed into the Java Sea last Monday has revealed the aircraft experienced problems with its airspeed indicators on its last four flights, while admissions from Lion Air have suggested technical difficulties the plane encountered were not isolated to that issue.

The new Boeing plane plunged into the sea off the coast of West Java thirteen minutes after takeoff on 29 October killing all 189 on board. The crash was the worst aviation disaster in Indonesia in more than two decades.



The head of Indonesia’s National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT) , Soerjanto Tjahjono, told reporters the Boeing 737 Max plane had suffered similar problems on its last four routes, according to information downloaded from its flight data recorder.

“When we opened the black box, yes indeed the technical problem was the airspeed or the speed of the plane,” Tjahjono said.

“Data from the black box showed that the two flights before Denpasar-Jakarta also experienced the same problem,” he said.

“In the black box there were four flights that experienced problems with the airspeed indicator.”

But Nyoman Rai Pering, head of Lion Air’s largest engineering facility located in Batam, told the Guardian problems with the plane were not isolated to the airspeed indicators in the days leading up to the crash.

Asked why the plane had descended from 39,000 feet to 30,000 feet on a flight from Manado to Denpasar on 27 October, and contrary to its regular flying pattern was then grounded for 12 hours, Pering acknowledged the plane had been undergoing repairs during that period.

“Yes, we took time to fix the problem Manado to Denpasar to make sure everything was fixed. We replaced the part suspected by our engineer,” Nyoman said.

“I think the problem was with the angle of attack, which controls the stability of the aircraft.”

The “angle of attack” or AOA indicates whether a plane is going to stall.

Given the acknowledged issues with both the angle of attack and airspeed indicators, aviation analyst Gerry Soejatman said the problems the jet encountered may be wider that initially believed, and linked to the plane’s air data reference unit (ADR).

The ADR takes in several key indicators including airspeed, altitude, air temperature, and the angle of attack.

“With all of this happening within a few days we suspect the problem is not just limited to the airspeed indication. This might mean there was an issue with the ADR box as a whole,” he said.

“It might be the ADR itself that was a fault, not those sensors.”

Amid the ongoing investigation safety experts say it is too early to determine the cause of the crash from Jakarta to tin-mining town of Pankal Pinang.

As part of an extended search mission, authorities continued to scour the seabed for the second “black box,” the cockpit’s voice recorder, in the Java Sea.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/06/lion-air-crash-black-boxes-reveal-plane-had-airspeed-problems-on-last-four-flights
Israeli army wounds ‘iconic’ Palestinian protester,Israeli army wounds ‘iconic’ Palestinian protester,0.0,"Abu Amro, whose photo has drawn comparisons with iconic French Revolution painting, was injured during protests.

Israeli soldiers have wounded a young Palestinian man whose photo has become recognised worldwide as a symbol of Palestinian resistance.

With a Palestinian flag in one hand and a slingshot poised in the other, the photo of 22-year-old A’ed Abu Amro has drawn comparisons with the iconic French Revolution painting, Liberty Leading the People.

On Monday, Abu Amro was taking part in protests at the northern Gaza border against Israel’s 11-year-old land, air and sea blockade when Israeli troops intervened. Abu Amro was wounded in the leg by live bullets.

He protests every Friday and Monday with friends.

“If I get killed, I want to be wrapped in the same flag. We are demanding our right of return, and protesting for our dignity and the dignity of our future generation,” Abu Amro told Al Jazeera late last month.

The photo, which went viral on social media and attracted international attention, was taken by Anadolu Agency photojournalist Mustafa Hassona during a demonstration demanding the lifting of Israel’s blockade of the Gaza Strip.

“I don’t go to protests to get pictures of me taken, but this has encouraged me to continue demonstrating,” he earlier told Al Jazeera.

For nearly seven months, Palestinians in the Gaza Strip have protested along the fence with Israel demanding their right to return to the homes and land their families were expelled from 70 years ago.

They are also demanding an end to Israel’s crippling blockade of the Gaza Strip, which has gutted the coastal enclave’s economy and deprived its two million inhabitants of many basic commodities.

Since the Great March of Return demonstrations began on March 30, more than 200 Palestinians have been killed and thousands more wounded by Israeli troops deployed along the other side of the fence.",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/11/israeli-army-wounds-iconic-palestinian-protester-181106122705253.html
Chinese city bans dog walking in daylight hours,Chinese city bans dog walking in daylight hours,0.0,"A city in China has banned pet owners from walking their dogs in daylight hours.

Pet owners in Wenshan will no longer be able to take their dogs out for a walk between the hours of 7am and 10pm, and they can't take them to parks, shopping centres, sports facilities and other public spaces.

The order appears to go much further than regulations in other parts of China.

Many provinces across China have strict rules on dog ownership, a result of the belief of Communist China's founder Mao Zedong that they are a ""bourgeois affectation"".

In Beijing, large dogs are banned in the city centre, and across the country dog parks are a rarity, with animals often required to stay on the lead.

Wensham officials have also said leads must be no longer than 3ft (1m) and animals can only be walked by adults.

Although dog ownership is growing in popularity, there remain fears in China over wild and unleashed dogs, partly down to the high number of deaths from rabies in the country every year.",https://news.sky.com/story/chinese-city-bans-dog-walking-in-daylight-hours-11546220
Air pollution: everything you should know about a public health emergency,Air pollution: everything you should know about a public health emergency,0.0,"Why is air pollution a fast-growing concern?

Nothing is more vital to life than breathing: in a lifetime, about 250m litres of air passes through your lungs. Yet walk along a busy city street and you will inhale something like 20m particles in a single lungful.

Toxic air is now the biggest environmental risk of early death, responsible for one in nine of all fatalities. It kills 7 million people a year, far more than HIV, tuberculosis and malaria combined, for example. Dr Maria Neira, the World Health Organisation director with responsibility for air pollution, is blunt: “It is a global public health emergency.”

How much does it cost us?

The lost lives and ill health caused are also a colossal economic burden: $225bn in lost labour income in 2013, or $5.11tn per year (about $1m a minute), if welfare losses are added in, according to a 2016 World Bank report, which called the figure “a sobering wake-up call”.

Air pollution is getting worse in the developing world and, while it is getting better in some developed nations, our knowledge of how comprehensively it damages our bodies and minds is growing even faster.

Dirty air has been with us for centuries – previously, we simply lived with it – and no one has yet had air pollution as a cause of death on their death certificate. It is only in recent decades that the damage to health has become clear, and in recent years that the health crisis has received widespread attention, thanks to research revelations, government legal defeats and the Volkswagen diesel scandal.

But there is a silver lining to air pollution’s cloud of smog: action to cut it not only brings immediate benefits but also helps fight climate change in the longer term.

Who does it affect?

Almost everyone. Over 90% off the world’s population lives in places where air pollution is above WHO guidelines. It is worst in south and east Asia, where most of humanity lives, with traffic, dirty industry and the open burning of waste delivering a triple whammy.

India has almost half of the top 50 most polluted cities in the world, China has eight and Iran has three. Africa is highly polluted but little measured: in 2015 Paris had three times more monitoring stations than the entire continent.

But air pollution still affects rich nations too. “The trends are positive if we look at the last 50 years, but it depends how many deaths are you ready to accept,” says Neira. “We still have 500,000 deaths in Europe [per year] and this is totally unacceptable.”

Children’s developing bodies are uniquely vulnerable, but 300 million live in places with extreme air pollution, where toxic fumes are six times higher than international guidelines.

Are there different types of air pollution?

Yes. The most damaging but best understood are tiny particles. These not only damage the lungs, but enter the bloodstream. They are increasingly thought to enter vital organs, including the brain and have been shown the reach the liver, spleen, kidneys and testes in lab animals.

The particles can be made of black carbon, nitrates, sulphates, ammonia or mineral dust. Most are produced by burning fossil fuels or wood, for driving, heating, power plants and industry.

While improvements have been made in some countries, for example, to coal-fired power stations and cars, other sources have lagged behind. Farming is one such source of pollution, with ammonia from livestock manure and fertilisers blowing into cities and forming particles, particularly in spring time when crops are sown and muck is spread.

Nitrogen dioxide, produced by diesel vehicles, not only forms particles but is now known to cause harm when breathed as a gas. It is still illegally high in much of urban Britain, for example, where it results in about 23,500 early deaths.

Other pollutants include sulphur dioxide, which is usually stripped out of vehicle fuels but still very high in ship and aviation fuels. Ground-level ozone, which forms on sunny days, harms people but also crops: 7-12% of the global wheat crop is estimated to be lost. In India, crop yields are reduced by 28% by ozone.

There are some natural sources of outdoor air pollution, such as dust storms and smoke from forest fires, but human-caused pollution far exceeds these. Outdoor air pollution causes 4.2 million early deaths, according to the WHO.

What about indoors?

This is also a huge killer, causing 3.8 million early deaths. (Some people are exposed to both indoor and outdoor pollution). Half the world’s population cook on open fires with dirty fuels such as wood, dung and charcoal, and kerosene in wick lamps also produces dangerous smoke.

More people are getting access to better fuels and stoves. Among farmers in Xuanwei in China, for example, cases of lung cancer fell by 40% when they switched to stoves with chimneys in their homes. But with the global population rising, the number of people exposed to indoor pollution is not falling.

What harm does air pollution do?

Increasingly, it is easier to ask what harm does air pollution not do. Research is now linking toxic air not only to almost every part of the body, but also to the mind.

The dangers of toxic air are a surprisingly recent discovery. The landmark research linking air pollution to lung diseases, heart attacks and strokes – the Harvard six cities study – was first published in 1993. Since then dirty air has been linked to many other conditions, such as diabetes. Air pollution contributed to 3.2m new cases of this illness in 2016, according to one study. Kidney disease appears to be influenced by air pollution, as does Alzheimer’s disease. The skin is affected too, ageing more rapidly in dirty air.

The research on babies and children is particularly worrying. A large recent study found toxic air significantly increases the risk of low birth weight, leading to lifelong damage to health. The doctors involved called this finding alone “something approaching a public health catastrophe”.

Millions of premature births may be linked to air pollution; another study makes the connection to birth defects and another to cot deaths. The first direct evidence of pollution particles in mothers’ placentas has also been revealed. “It is a worrying problem – there is a massive association between air pollution a mother breathes in and the effect it has on the foetus,” said the lead researcher.

As children grow, asthma and stunted lung growth is a serious issue linked to air pollution, as is the ability to learn in school and the risk of teenage delinquency.

The estimated annual death toll of 7 million is certain to be an underestimation, as it only includes particle pollution and the five most firmly linked causes of death, such as heart attacks. Early estimates using improved models suggest a total figure of 9 million from particle pollution.

But even this is only “the tip of the iceberg” of harm, according to researchers. That is because the ubiquitous exposure to air pollution is likely to damage the health of almost everyone in some way, even if it doesn’t lead to a visit to the doctor.

The WHO is clear: “The burden of disease from [outdoor] air pollution is expected to greatly increase”.

Can I protect myself?

The rise of concern over air pollution has prompted a plethora of protection products. Masks are now commonly advertised, but experts say they are of limited use unless they have an airtight seal on the face, which is rare.

Giant towers, street-side benches and living, green walls have all been proposed to filter dirty air. A new bus aims to filter the air in Southampton, UK, as it travels. Trees can help too, unless they block the breezes that blow pollution away, in which case they make things worse.

Other suggestions are pollution-monitoring apps, so people can choose to avoid the worst times, and alternative city walking routes that keep pedestrians away from the filthiest roads.

People in cars are often exposed to more pollution than those outside, as fumes become trapped in the cabin. Closing the air circulation in your car before hitting the city centre is certainly a good idea.

There is also some evidence that omega oils and vitamin B may offer some protection against the damage caused by air pollution.

Isn’t that treating the symptom, not the cause?

Yes. The only practical way to tackle the global health emergency is to cut levels of pollution at source. There is an ethical angle too, says Dr Gary Fuller, at Kings College London: “Morally it is not right to make the victims change their behaviour, instead of the culprits.”

Poorer people are also most exposed to air pollution. “There are huge injustices at the heart of the air pollution problem,”’ says Fuller. “By using our air to dispose of their waste, polluters are destroying a shared resource and avoiding the full cost of their actions.”

What next?

The solutions are simultaneously perfectly possible and incredibly hard, because they require little new technology but involve action across many areas, and are usually neither politically palatable – yet – or very profitable to implement.

“There are two big transitions we need to have,” says Neira. “One is a healthy energy transition and the other is the healthy urban planning transition. We need to stop the use of coal, to stop the massive use of private cars in cities and make our buildings more efficient.”

Coal burning is declining globally and China has shown how industrial pollution can be rapidly curbed. Particle pollution is down by a third, just four years after a “war on pollution” was declared, and eight after Beijing’s air was labelled “crazy bad” when pollution leapt off the charts. But cities around the world are expanding rapidly, with 4.2 billion urban dwellers set to swell to 6.7 billion by 2050.

How those expanded cities are constructed is vital, say experts like Fuller: “We will pay a heavy price if we get it wrong now.”. Mobility should focus on walking, cycling and public transport - even electric vehicles throw up particle pollution from road abrasion and brake dust. The remaining cars and lorries need to be set - and stick to - much stricter pollution controls.

Buildings ought to be heated and cooled using renewable energy and waste should not be burned without stringent controls.

Progress is being made in some places. Some Dutch and Danish towns have turned their back on cars and Seoul in South Korea has demolished 15 expressways in favour of bus lanes and a new river. But some motoring lobbies and car manufacturers remain obstacles to citizens breathing clean air.

Neira, a former health minister in Spain, says politicians should play the health card to win the argument: “If you reduce cases of asthma, everybody will love it.” Other reasons for action are the climate change benefits of cutting coal, oil and gas burning and the reduction in obesity that follows more active travel, such as cycling.

What must be done to end the air pollution emergency is not the issue, says Neira, it is the lack of serious political will: “There are plenty of ideas and solutions. It takes leadership.”

New blow for UK car industry as European parts factories close,New blow for UK car industry as European parts factories close,0.0,"More than 1,400 British jobs are at risk after two European suppliers of car parts, Schaeffler and Michelin, announced plans to close UK factories in a blow to the wider automotive industry ahead of Brexit.

Schaeffler, the German car parts supplier, said uncertainty surrounding Brexit had contributed to its decision to close two UK factories, in Llanelli, Wales, and Plymouth, where 570 people are employed. The company said the closures would take place over the next two years.

French tyremaker Michelin announced plans to close its factory in Dundee in 2020, nearly 50 years after it opened and where 845 people are employed. It blamed dwindling demand for smaller tyres. It said the decision was unrelated to the Brexit vote.

At Schaeffler’s plant in Plymouth, a workforce of 350 people makes bearings and machine parts for the firm’s industrial division as well as the aerospace and defence industries.

At Llanelli, about 220 people are employed to make mechanical parts and bearings for the major car manufacturers and other industrial suppliers. The company said it would relocate production from the two UK factories to existing plants in the US, China, South Korea and Germany.

The union Unite said it would “fight for every job” as it tries to avert the closures.

Tony Burke, assistant general secretary, said: “This is yet another body blow for the UK’s automotive supply chain and the wider car industry. It should leave no one in any doubt as to what is in store if the UK crashes out of the European Union without a deal that secures tariff-free frictionless trade.

“The uncertainty surrounding the Tories’ shambolic handling of Brexit and their piecemeal industrial strategy is having real consequences. Behind the closures and the uncertainty currently gripping the car industry and component manufacturing are people with bills to pay and families to feed.”

The wider UK car industry has repeatedly urged the government to make frictionless trade a priority in Brexit negotiations or risk the loss of thousands of UK jobs.

Schaeffler currently employs more than 1,000 people in the UK and said its factory in Sheffield would remain open, while operations at its two logistics centres in Sutton Coldfield and Hereford would be combined in Hereford.

Michelin said it was no longer financially viable to keep its Dundee factory open because of a fall in demand for premium tyres of 16-inches and smaller, which are made at the site. It also blamed a shift in that market to low-cost versions made in Asia.

John Reid, factory manager at Michelin Dundee, said: “I understand that these proposals will come as a huge blow to our employees and to the city of Dundee as a whole. It’s also a very personal blow for me.

“This factory has faced incredibly tough challenges before and we have come through thanks to the hard work and flexibility of our people and the union, and the backing of the Michelin group. However, the market for the smaller tyres we make has changed dramatically and permanently, and the company has to address these structural changes.”",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/06/new-blow-for-uk-car-industry-as-european-parts-factories-close-michelin-schaeffler
Energy bills likely to rise next year despite government price cap,Energy bills likely to rise next year despite government price cap,0.0,"Energy prices are likely to rise just three months after the government’s price cap takes effect on 1 January, Ofgem has admitted.

The energy regulator revealed that the final level of the cap would be £1,137 a year for a typical customer on a default tariff, up by £1.23 on the provisional level it laid out in September.

That should amount to an average saving of about £76 for the 11m households on default tariffs, but any relief for consumers may be short-lived.

Ofgem noted that wholesale costs are about 35% higher than a year ago. “If this trend in underlying costs continues, it is likely that in February 2019 we will announce an increase in the level of the cap to take effect in April,” it said on Tuesday.

Comparison sites and industry groups warned that more rises were coming despite the cap, and urged people to switch to better deals.

Stephen Murray, an energy expert at MoneySuperMarket, said: “If you do nothing, you could be in for a nasty surprise come spring next year.”

Richard Neudegg, the head of regulation at uSwitch.com, added: “There is a very good chance that the price of standard tariffs will change three times over the next 12 months, and potentially for the worse rather than the better.”

Industry watchers have previously warned that cost pressures on suppliers could drive up bills by 5%, or about £60, by next April.

The government said the cap, which will be updated every six months, would make the market fairer.

Claire Perry, the energy minister, said: “Today’s final cap level brings greater fairness to energy prices and puts consumers at the heart of the energy market.”

But trade body Energy UK said competition was already growing and the cap posed a “significant challenge” to many of the 70-plus suppliers on the market.

MPs and fuel poverty groups also raised concerns over 1m households being shifted from an existing, lower cap for vulnerable customers to the new, higher cap.

Rachel Reeves, chair of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy select committee, said ministers needed to: “ensure that vulnerable customers do not slip through the net and actually find themselves worse off.”

Consumer group Citizens Advice said while the cap would make prices fairer for many consumers, they would save more by changing tariff or supplier.

Which? magazine also pointed out the cap will not touch the third of tariffs above the cap, because they are fixed ones rather than “standard variable” default tariffs.

Ofgem conceded that the number of households switching may go down under the cap, potentially by as much as half, but more likely 30%-40%. That would reverse years of growth in switches, and see millions fewer households changing supplier.

The energy regulator expects the cap will knock 5% off energy firms’ profits, and wipe up to £1.18bn off their revenues. British Gas owner Centrica and SSE, the market’s two biggest players, saw their shares rise by 1.49% and 0.65% respectively.

While the cap is set at £1,137 a year for what Ofgem defines as typical usage of electricity and gas, people who are higher energy consumers will pay more. The cap is the maximum suppliers can charge per unit of energy and for a standing charge.",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/06/energy-bills-rise-price-cap
"Wind turbines acting as ‘apex predators’ by driving down bird numbers, study finds","Wind turbines acting as ‘apex predators’ by driving down bird numbers, study finds",0.0,"Wind turbines can act as top predators in ecosystems by driving down populations of birds and triggering knock-on effects across food chains, according to a new study.

Scientists found that predatory raptor birds were four times rarer in parts of an Indian mountain range covered in wind turbines, suggesting they were avoiding the structures.

The same areas saw an explosion in numbers the raptors’ prey, fan-throated lizards, which also became more confident and less scared of humans due to the lack of predation.

“We have basically added a new apex predator – a wind turbine,” Dr Maria Thaker from the Indian Institute of Science in Bengaluru told The Independent.

“What that predator does is remove the level below it – not kill it, but the outcome is the same.”

These cascading effects on ecosystems suggest that care should be taken to ensure that wind turbines do not have dangerous and far-reaching consequences for nature.

Scientists have become increasingly aware of the impact these massive structures can have on wildlife, with studies showing birds and bats can be killed or scared away by their spinning blades.

However, this wind power playing a significant role in driving the transition away from fossil fuels to reduce the impact of climate change, experts say there is a need to establish a compromise and ensure turbines are built in areas with the lowest impact possible.

“The bottom line for me is that I will pick wind energy over fossil fuels any day,” said Dr Thaker.

“We just have to be smart about where we put them, so can we minimise our impact on the ecosystem by picking areas that are not unique in ways that we cannot replace.”

She suggested putting wind turbines in places that we have already disrupted, such as on top of buildings, and said there must be a dialogue between ecologists and the renewables industry.

Recommended Wind power overtakes nuclear in UK for first time

Dr Thaker’s findings were published in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution.

In the UK, the RSPB has examined the issue of wind farms and concluded this kind of strategic approach is required to ensure that harm is kept to a minimum.

While noting that “climate change poses the single greatest long-term threat to our wildlife”, they say wind farms should be located away from major migration routes and important feeding, breeding and roosting areas of vulnerable bird species.

“Wind farms, while they have a crucial role in mitigating the effects of climate change, must be built in the right places so they don’t harm bird populations,” said Dr Aly McCluskie, a conservation scientist at the RSPB.

“In places such as the North Sea, we are beginning to see an unprecedented industrialisation of the marine environment.

“The cumulative effects of ever more poorly sited wind farms are likely to have dire consequences for our seabirds, adding to the pressures from a changing climate.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/wind-power-turbines-birds-predators-renewable-energy-lizards-rspb-a8619236.html
Eight dead in worst escalation of violence in Gaza since 2014,Eight dead in worst escalation of violence in Gaza since 2014,0.0,"Eight people have been killed in the worst escalation of violence Gaza has seen since the 2014 war.

A fresh wave of fighting erupted in the Gaza Strip, leaving an Israeli soldier and seven Palestinians dead after two days of unrest.

An Israeli aircraft fired towards a militant who was part of a group launching rockets at its territory, the Israeli military said.

The Israeli military said an Israeli soldier was also killed and another wounded after a firefight erupted.

It came as a man in southern Israel was killed after Gaza militants fired dozens of rockets at a residential building early on Tuesday.

Hamas and other militant groups have since said they had accepted an Egyptian-brokered ceasefire to end two days of fighting with Israel that had pushed the sworn enemies to the brink of a new war.

The escalation had risked derailing efforts by the United Nations, Egypt and Qatar to broker a long-term truce.

Image: Hamas published a video appearing to show an Israeli army bus being hit by guided missiles

On Tuesday, the US condemned rocket and missile attacks from Gaza into Israel and said it stood with Israel.

""We condemn in the strongest terms the rocket, missile and mortar attacks that are taking place from Gaza into Israel,"" US State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said at a news briefing.

""We call for the sustained halt of those attacks. We stand with Israel as Israel defends itself against these attacks. It is simply unacceptable to target civilians.""

The fresh cross-border attacks were triggered by a botched Israeli undercover raid into the Gaza Strip late on Sunday, marking the most serious escalation since an Israel-Hamas war in 2014.

One Hamas commander and six other gunmen were killed, while an Israeli commander also died in the raid.

About 400 rockets and mortars have been launched from Gaza since the current round began on Monday, with 100 intercepted by Israel's Iron Dome defence system, the Israeli military said.

In Israel, at least 20 people have been wounded, several seriously.

Following the Palestinian deaths the armed wing of Hamas threatened to step up its attacks and fire rockets further north towards the Israeli cities of Ashdod and Beersheeba if Israel did not cease fire.

Over the past few months the two sides have come close to a major escalation several times, but have stepped back in favour of giving a long-term Egyptian mediated truce a chance.

In Gaza, schools, government offices and banks were closed on Tuesday while classes were cancelled in Israeli towns near the border.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened his cabinet to discuss their next move while the military said it had sent infantry and armoured reinforcements to the Gaza frontier.

He declared that he wanted to avert ""unnecessary"" war in Gaza.

"Hodeida, Yemen war: City which holds the fate of 14 million","Hodeida, Yemen war: City which holds the fate of 14 million",0.0,"As bullets, shrapnel and bodies are strewn across the streets of Hodeida — a vital Arab port city in the impoverished, war-torn Yemen — more than 14 million pairs of eyes are firmly fixed on what happens next.

It could decide whether they live or die as the country sits of the brink of a famine.

That’s because just under half of the Arab nation’s emaciated population desperately need food, medicine and supplies and more than 75 per cent of it is fed into Yemen through the crucial Red Sea port.

But the fighting in Hodeida — home to more than 2.5 million people — is far from over.

In fact, despite calls from the US two weeks ago to end the chaos engulfing the dirt poor country, the fighting has just intensified dramatically.

The Sunni Muslim Saudis are refusing to let the predominantly Shia Houthis retain control of the city because they are accusing Iran of smuggling in arms to support the Houthis through the port.

Today, medics have confirmed that least 150 people have been killed in 24 hours of clashes as Yemen’s government forces, backed by Saudi Arabia, use any means necessary to oust Iran-backed Houthi rebels who have held the city since 2014.

In all, nearly 600 people have been killed since clashes erupted in the city on November 1, ending a short-lived suspension in a pro-government offensive to take the city that began in June.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned of a possible “catastrophic situation” if the port is destroyed.

“The fighting must stop, a political debate must begin and we must prepare a massive humanitarian response to avoid the worst next year,” he said.

TERRIFYING HOSPITAL ATTACK

Amnesty International has now called on the Australian Government to suspend all military exports to Saudi Arabia after Hodeida’s only functioning hospital containing dozens of children was struck on Sunday.

It is feared that 59 children inside the hospital, 25 of them in intensive care, face an “imminent risk of death”, according to UNICEF.

Hundreds of patients and staff dodged a hail of shrapnel which “sounded like rain” as they fled in panic from the vital Al-Thawra Hospital, a medical worker told the human rights organisation.

“I saw a patient carrying another patient. It looked like a mother and daughter. The mother was skin and bones, she was malnourished, a typical Yemeni mother … Nonetheless, she was managing to carry her 15 or 16-year-old daughter in her arms,” he said.

“Her daughter was crying. I knew she had either just had surgery or had been in preparation for surgery because she was in a blue surgical robe. There are no words to describe how I felt at this moment.

“I also saw a man walking as fast as he could while carrying a bag of his own urine. He was still attached to a urinary catheter while making his escape. This scene will stay with me for the rest of my life. There were many children too. Some parents were carrying their children. I saw 10 or 12 children among everyone else trying to flee.”

The World Health Organisation said the hospital “used to serve about 1500 people per day (but) is now almost inaccessible as the ground fighting is raging”.

As the terrifying conflict intensifies, it’s still unclear who is winning.

• ~10,000 people killed

• Millions displaced

• On brink of famine

A map of the conflict in Yemen: https://t.co/W7vCDj9zVr pic.twitter.com/e8sW1fBECo — Al Jazeera English (@AJEnglish) November 12, 2018

In a statement sent via the Telegram messaging app, the Houthis said they had “lured” loyalists up the western coastline of Hodeida, where the rebels then launched an attack on the troops.

However, government forces, led on the ground by Saudi-backed troops, have finally made their way into the city after 11 days of clashes, reaching residential neighbourhoods in the east on Sunday.

This has sparked fears of street fighting further endangering civilians trapped in the city.

BELATED GLOBAL BACKLASH

Saudi Arabia and its allies intervened in the Yemeni Government’s fight against the Houthis in 2015, triggering what the UN now calls the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.

But only now, after four years of conflict, has the offensive sparked an international outcry.

Britain, the United States and France have all called for an end to hostilities. All three countries are major suppliers of arms to Saudi Arabia.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has urged Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, a major ally of Washington, to engage in peace talks.

British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt met with Saudi King Salman and Prince Mohammed on Monday during a visit to the kingdom to press the leaders to support UN efforts to end the conflict.

Mr Hunt also flew to the United Arab Emirates, a key pillar of the Saudi-led coalition, to meet Sheik Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi.

In France, Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said it was time “the international community said enough is enough”.

“There will be no victor in this war,” he told France 2 TV.

Amnesty International blames both the Houthis and Saudis for the chaos in Hodeida.

“In armed conflict, hospitals are supposed to be places of sanctuary. But as the battle for control of Hodeida intensifies, both sides seem intent on eviscerating the laws of war and disregarding the protected status of even the most vulnerable civilians,” said Lynn Maalouf, Middle East research director at Amnesty International.

The Saudi coalition has come under intense international pressure to end the conflict, particularly following the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, an ardent critic of Prince Mohammed, in his country’s consulate in Istanbul on October 2.

Multiple countries, including Germany and Norway, have announced the suspension of arms sales to Saudi Arabia after Khashoggi’s killing.

United Nations’ Yemen envoy Martin Griffiths is pushing for peace talks between the Houthis and the government by the end of the year.

On Saturday, the United States, which for years provided military training and aerial refuelling for the Saudi-led coalition, announced it would end its in-flight refuelling support for the alliance.

Teacher with criminal history arrested after altercation with student,Teacher with criminal history arrested after altercation with student,0.0,"RCMP have arrested a Halifax-area teacher accused of assault and mischief after an Oct. 3 incident involving a student.

Derek William Stephenson, an English teacher at Cole Harbour District High School, was arrested Nov. 9 and is scheduled to appear in Dartmouth provincial court on Dec. 12, RCMP said in a news release Tuesday. No charges have yet been laid.

Stephenson is currently on administrative leave and has voluntarily surrendered his teaching licence, the Halifax Regional Centre for Education said in a statement today.

""An altercation occurred when the man removed ear buds from a 15-year-old youth's ears,"" the RCMP release says. ""The youth then removed the man's lanyard that was attached to keys in his pants pocket. The man then pushed the youth into a wall, and put him on the floor.""

The boy reported the incident to the school administration. He was then checked by emergency health services, but wasn't found to have any injuries.

The RCMP were called to the school and investigated.

Reached by phone on Tuesday, Stephenson declined comment.

""I have been instructed not to speak to the media,"" he said. ""Thank you very much.""

Criminal history known by administrators

The administration at the Halifax-area high school knew that Stephenson had a criminal history involving threats and domestic violence, and had vouched for his character with justice officials following at least one of his earlier encounters with the law.

The Oct. 3 incident happened in a classroom, and a four-second video recorded by another student has been circulating on the social media app Snapchat, where a man is seen kneeling and briefly putting a student in a choke hold.

The latest incident is raising questions about what Halifax-area education officials beyond the school knew of the criminal charges Stephenson previously faced while he was a teacher, and what measures, if any, were taken.

That past includes pleading guilty in October 2017 to threatening his ex-girlfriend, who is a teacher at another school, and a November 2013 guilty plea for assaulting his ex-wife, a case in which a charge of assaulting his daughter was withdrawn. In 2010, a woman also got an emergency protection order against him.

On Nov. 9, he was arrested and is scheduled to appear in Dartmouth provincial court next month following an altercation with a student in the classroom. (CBC)

Nancy Jakeman, a former member of the Halifax Regional School Board, said elected members were never told about those cases. It's something that now strikes her as an unsettling lack of transparency and accountability, given board members were typically informed when other teachers faced charges.

""It definitely bothers me,"" Jakeman said in an interview. ""It raises concerns. The fact that it wasn't brought forth to the board, I just don't agree with that, I think that it should have been.""

It also doesn't sit well with the family of the 15-year-old student Stephenson is accused of assaulting. The student's older brother said in an interview that the teen told him the incident started after Stephenson ripped out the student's earphones.

The older brother, who is an adult and was not present, said his younger brother told him he then touched Stephenson's lanyard. The teacher began to taunt the teen, he said, and then ""charged at him and tackled him,"" shoving the boy against the wall.

""If you have somebody that has assault charges and then you let them work at the school and then they assault somebody again, that's really a bad decision on their part,"" the older brother said of school officials.

CBC News has decided not to identify the student due to his age. The assault allegation has not been proven in court.

While Stephenson has previously been found guilty of crimes, court documents and audio recordings of past court proceedings show how glowing references, including at least one from a school administrator, have helped him avoid a criminal record.

In 2013, Stephenson was arrested outside Cole Harbour District High School and charged with assaulting his now ex-wife and their daughter at a Dartmouth, N.S., home.

He pleaded guilty that November to assaulting his wife; the court was told he grabbed her by the hair and pushed her. He was handed 18 months of probation and ordered to attend an intimate partner violence prevention program.

He received a conditional discharge, which meant he had been found guilty but would not have a criminal record after three years so long as he completed probation without a problem.

Vice-principal part of 'glowing' report for court

The then vice-principal at Cole Harbour High, Barrett Khan, provided a character reference for Stephenson's pre-sentence report, describing his creative dedication to working with students on initiatives, including producing videos, spoken word, musicals and building a haunted house.

At sentencing, Crown and defence lawyers agreed the pre-sentence report, especially Khan's reference, led them to a joint-recommendation of a conditional discharge, because the assault appeared to be out of character.

Defence lawyer Geoff Newton highlighted to the judge Stephenson's work with students at the school and the ""glowing nature of the pre-sentence report,"" arguing he should not be sent to jail. Crown prosecutor Perry Borden noted the ""vice-principal at his school spoke very highly of him and his abilities.""

Judge Alana Murphy granted Stephenson the discharge. She ordered a DNA sample be taken from him.

In court again, 4 years later

In October 2017, Stephenson also received a conditional discharge for mischief and threatening his ex-girlfriend. A charge of assaulting her was withdrawn. He was put on probation, and ordered to take anger management courses and to stay away from his ex-girlfriend.

Following his arrest on those charges, a fellow teacher at Cole Harbour, Peter Mahalik, acted as his surety to secure his release.

The Crown noted at sentencing a ""positive pre-sentence report."" He said Stephenson had been candid about his anger management problems and had ""lost his temper in the course of a domestic dispute.""

Defence lawyer Michelle James said it was in her client's ""best interest to remain criminal-record free, given the nature of his employment.""

In granting the conditional discharge, Judge Jean Whalen said: ""If you're asked whether you've been found guilty of a criminal offence you have to say yes because I have to find you guilty before I impose sentence. If you're asked do you have a criminal record, you can say no because a conditional discharge is not a criminal record. What anybody does with that information, I have no control over, Mr. Stephenson.""

Safety of students a priority: principal

Following the incident at the school last month, students in the classroom went to the school's office to report what happened, the boy's brother said.

In a message sent home from the school on the day of the incident, principal Dunovan Kalberlah said the staff member has been placed on leave pending the outcome of the investigation.

""The safety of our students is always a top priority,"" Kalberlah wrote.

Doug Hadley, Halifax Regional Centre for Education spokesperson, would not speak to the incident or to Stephenson's employment history, describing it as a ""confidential, personnel matter.""

The HRCE is responsible for administering the region's schools. It was created on April 1 after the provincial government dissolved all elected school boards in favour of an appointed advisory council.

Hadley would also not confirm if education officials received any reports about Stephenson's criminal history, or what action was taken in response.

""I can say that the HRCE takes any matter potentially impacting the safety and security of our students very seriously and we take all reasonable measures to ensure their safety is protected at all times while under our supervision,"" Hadley said in an email to CBC News last month.

Volunteers need regular police checks

School volunteers must clear a police background check and a check of the province's child abuse registry every three years, according to HRCE policy.

However, teachers only require a background check when hired, unless they break service longer than three months during the school year, according to the HRCE student protection policy.

Stephenson would not have passed a criminal-record check and a vulnerable-sector check until three years after pleading guilty, according to Const. John MacLeod, a Halifax Regional Police spokesperson.

After being hired, if a teacher is under a criminal investigation, it is their duty to report that to the HRCE, said Hadley. There is no specific HRCE policy stating which crimes would be grounds for dismissal.

""If an employee was convicted of a crime, our human resources department would investigate the details of the conviction to determine if there is impact to them as an employee,"" said Hadley.

""Every situation is unique, and there are many factors which are considered when determining whether a criminal conviction would impact a person as an employee of the HRCE.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/cole-harbour-high-teacher-charged-derek-stephenson-1.4902680

Six people were injured, but no one died. Police in Guyana said this week that a dozen firefighters were arrested on Friday for allegedly stealing from some of the 120 passengers who were on the flight, as well as from the pilot and crew members.

Crew members had struggled for a while before takeoff to close the front door of the plane, and 10 minutes after they made it into the air, the pilot announced that a hydraulic malfunction was forcing him to circle back to the airport.

Article content As the plane approached ground level, the landing gear deployed properly and the touchdown was comfortable, Bedessee recalled. But it soon became evident that the brakes weren’t slowing the plane’s forward momentum. Bedessee said the aircraft blew down the runway over spikes that popped a couple of its tires. Part of the landing gear tore off; so did the right wing. The plane swerved to the right, smashed through a chain-link fence and stopped in a pile of sand three metres away from the edge of a ravine. The drop-off from there was another nine to 12 metres. “Only with the light of dawn were we aware of how close we were to that ravine and how close we came to be a statistic of airline tragedies,” another passenger, Cyril Bryan of Toronto, said in an email.

He said the plane began to emit smoke five to 10 minutes after he got outside. As firefighters were summoned, he gave his contact information to the flight crew, went to a hotel to eat and shower and later returned to Cheddi Jagan around 1 p.m. It took until 5 p.m. for a customs agent to retrieve his luggage, at which point Bedessee, rifling through the knapsack to find his inhaler, noticed that his cash, keys, chargers and the iPhone he uses for travel were all missing. Guyana Police Force Assistant Commissioner Marlon Chapman, who oversees the division that is investigating the alleged thefts aboard the plane, said officers detained 12 firefighters on Friday after finding in their possession phones, cash, jewelry and other items that appeared to belong to passengers and crew members. Chapman wouldn’t say if police plan to lay charges, but noted that there are no other suspects.

Article content The Guyana Fire Service said its chief, Marlon Gentle, was not available for comment. When asked what action, if any, Global Affairs Canada plans to take in response to reports of theft on the flight, a department spokesperson said in an email that, “Canadian consular officials are in contact with local authorities and stand ready to provide consular assistance to Canadian citizens if needed.” Photo by Peter J. Thompson / National Post Bedessee, meanwhile, said he and a group of fellow Canadian passengers are considering a class action lawsuit against Fly Jamaica to seek damages for the stress of the ordeal. He’s also waiting for his travel partners to be able to fly out of Guyana, hopefully by this weekend. He said one of them is a man in his 70s who had his passport and phone stolen off the crashed plane. As he waited for his bags last Friday afternoon, Bedessee called his travel agent and asked to be booked on the next flight to Canada. It left Guyana on Saturday morning, and save for a hiccup during a layover in Trinidad when a mechanical problem, of all things, forced him to change planes, the journey was smooth. It was a relief for a man who’d cried at his seat before takeoff, troubled by what had happened a day earlier. “The passenger beside me gave me a little comfort,” Bedessee said. “He just said, ‘Take a deep breath — relax, relax.’” • Email: nfaris@postmedia.com | Twitter: @nickmfaris

A universe of flawed heroes: Stan Lee was ahead of his time,A universe of flawed heroes: Stan Lee was ahead of his time,0.0,"AP — It became easy, in recent years, to dismiss him as the wisecracking grandpa of the American comic book, a past-his-prime gimmick who cameoed alongside Earth’s angstiest superheroes in the high-grossing Marvel blockbusters of the past decade.

But Stan Lee, who died Monday aged 95, was far more than that. It’s no stretch to say that he helped redraw the world of American fiction. And he certainly made sure everyone knew it.

From the ashes of pulp magazines and the radioactive raw material of postwar uncertainty about science and power, he summoned — not singlehandedly, but certainly without parallel or peer — a textured, self-sustaining universe of imperfect heroes.

While Updike and Cheever were doing it in literature, while Kubrick and Lumet and Penn were doing it at the movies, the father of Marvel presented comic-book America — which meant, at the time, mostly adolescent boys — with a pantheon of deeply flawed protagonists who, despite their presence in so many tales to astonish, were in many ways just like you and me.

These outcasts and misfits rose to the alarm clock’s buzzing and slogged to work each morning to get the job done, not in a fanciful Metropolis or Gotham but on the actual streets of New York City and in the imperfect America beyond it. For them, the struggle was the thing — no matter whether the task was saving the world, paying the rent or trying to make ends meet as a freelance photographer or a blind lawyer or an itinerant stunt motorcyclist.

Unlike DC Comics’ iconic heroes, many of whom had been destined for greatness as the last sons of doomed planets, Amazon royalty or rightful kings of the sea, the likes of Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four, Iron Man, the Ghost Rider and the Incredible Hulk composed a catalog of human frailties — schmoes who inadvertently, or negligently, wandered into the traffic of destiny.

Some moneyed, some working-class, all neurotic, they had powers thrust upon them by misfortune or questionable choices. Their abilities were just as often bane as boon. And sometimes it was hard to tell the heroes and the villains apart. Sort of like real life.

This was in no small measure due to Lee, the son of Jewish immigrants, who as Marvel’s editor-in-chief wrote many of the books himself during comics’ “Silver Age” years of the early 1960s. With seemingly boundless energy and a staggering variety of voices, he breathed personality, ambiguity and a common narrative into soon-to-be-beloved characters.

“One of the things we try to demonstrate in our yarns is that nobody is all good, or all bad,” Lee wrote in a column for Marvel’s March 1969 issues. “Even a shoddy super-villain can have a redeeming trait, just as any howlin’ hero might have his nutty hang-ups.”

It’s hard to overestimate how groundbreaking this philosophy was in a nation that, with a tone set by production-code Hollywood since the early 1930s, had spent three decades positioning largely unambiguous heroes at the center of its rising mass culture. Add government efforts in the 1950s to demonize comics as the mind-decayers of America’s youth, and to push publishers back toward pablum, and you’ll have some idea what Lee accomplished at the beginning of the 1960s.

Suddenly here was Tony Stark, a genius inventor with daddy issues (and, we would eventually learn, an alcoholic narcissist) who fixed his literally broken heart by turning himself into Iron Man. Here was Peter Parker, a meek high-school nerd who had no clue how to handle the creepy abilities and hormonal changes bestowed upon him by the bite of a radioactive spider on a class field trip. Talk about playing to your target audience.

Here was Bruce Banner, a military scientist who tried to save someone from one of his test blasts and ended up locked in a battle with his own angry, destructive id — hardly an incidental narrative in an era when psychotherapy and self-help were sharply on the rise. And here was Matt Murdock, blinded in a horrible accident by irradiated waste, proving every night with precision radar powers, as Daredevil, that disability isn’t necessarily destiny. And here were the X-Men, mutants and perpetual outsiders whose struggle to find a place in the mainstream on Earth has been variously framed as a parable for race relations, anti-Semitism and the Red Scare.

Even Steve Rogers, whose Captain America was the most Superman-like of the bunch, had demons. He was the skinny kid rejected by his World War II draft board who wanted so badly to fight that he volunteered to be a guinea pig for a “supersoldier serum” that would turn him into the ultimate fighting machine.

Captain America debuted during the war years when Marvel was still called Timely Comics, but Lee and his team updated the story for the 1960s by giving Rogers even more ghosts: He lay frozen in ice for nearly two decades after falling into the sea, and awakened out of time in a fast-changing, morally murky world he barely recognized or could navigate.

There was another, less-noticed corner where Lee was equally groundbreaking. As Marvel’s editor, in an age before computers were in every pocket, he worked tirelessly to develop a relationship with his audience.

He talked about stuff behind the scenes and curated a tallish tale of a wacky, collegial studio of writers and artists who might do just about anything in their pursuit of good stories. His regular column, “Stan’s Soapbox,” talked directly to readers in a way that presaged the kind of access to celebrities that Twitter, Facebook and Instagram afford today.

Many felt Lee didn’t share enough credit with such comics pioneers as Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, who worked alongside him in those early years as he developed the “Marvel Method” of story development. Fair enough. But part of Lee’s genius was his ability to be a master of collage.

Like a Bob Dylan or a Gene Roddenberry, Lee took cultural threads — elements already afoot in society — and constructed his own quilt. While his source material was sometimes derivative, what he stitched was something new under the sun.

And within his emerging pantheon of white male angst, Lee was often an enthusiastic champion of progressive views about race, if not always gender. The now-fabled Black Panther first appeared in a Marvel comic book in 1966, becoming one of the earliest mainstream superheroes of African descent, though it took until 1973 for him to snag a marquee spot in a comic entitled “Jungle Action.”

“None of us is all that different from each other. We all want essentially the same things outta life,” Lee wrote in the pages of Marvel Comics in February 1980. “So why don’t we all stop wasting time hating the ‘other’ guys. Just look in the mirror, mister — that other guy is you.”

Marvel is a calibrated commercial juggernaut now, its stories drowning in the merchandise that amplifies them. It has been dismissed as mass-produced storytelling for a mass-produced age. Yet somehow, among the things Lee manages to leave behind is a lingering sense — snake oil, maybe, but potent nonetheless — that with Marvel’s tales, still, anything might happen.

Because, as Stan Lee knew well before America did, we still want our fantastic, unlikely superheroes to be just like us. Or, more saliently, we want to believe that we can be just like them. And who knows what they might do to prevail because, after all, who really knows what we might do? Maybe we can be heroes, sure, but the rent’s still due on the 15th.",https://www.timesofisrael.com/a-universe-of-flawed-heroes-stan-lee-was-ahead-of-his-time/

According to Pancreatic Cancer UK, three-quarters of people with pancreatic cancer will die within a year of diagnosis. This makes it the deadliest common cancer in the UK. Cancer of the pancreas is difficult to treat, and is often not detected until the cancer is fairly advanced. If the tumour is large or has spread to other parts of the body, treatment will be more difficult.

Pancreatic cancer can be difficult to diagnose because the symptoms can seem quite generic or can be mistaken for other diseases or conditions Pancreatic Cancer UK

It’s therefore vital to know what symptoms to look out for, so you can get the necessary treatment as soon as possible. However, symptoms are often not evident in the early stages of the disease, and can be mistaken for other problems. “Pancreatic cancer can be difficult to diagnose because the symptoms can seem quite generic or can be mistaken for other diseases or conditions,” said Jeni Jones, specialist nurse at Pancreatic Cancer UK. So what are the symptoms of pancreatic cancer? Common symptoms of the disease, according to Pancreatic Cancer UK, include tummy and back pain, unexplained weight loss and indigestion. Other symptoms include loss of appetite, changes to bowel habits, jaundice, problems digesting food, nausea and vomiting, and difficulty swallowing.

Pancreatic cancer symptoms are not always evident in the early stages

Changes to bowel habits can include pale, smelly poo that may float, diarrhoea and constipation. Problems digesting food can include feeling full quickly when eating, bloating, burping or lots of wind. Recently diagnosed diabetes could also be a sign of an underlying pancreatic problem. Symptoms may be quite vague and may come and go to begin with. If you experience any of these symptoms, they could be a sign of something else like IBS, but it’s advisable to get them checked out just in case. “These symptoms don’t necessarily mean that you have pancreatic cancer, but you should get them checked out,” said Jones.

‘We do not have a policy that prohibits alleged falsehoods’: Facebook on why it did not take down States Times Review post,‘We do not have a policy that prohibits alleged falsehoods’: Facebook on why it did not take down States Times Review post,0.0,"SINGAPORE: Social media giant Facebook on Tuesday (Nov 13) explained why it did not accede to Singapore authorities’ request to take down a States Times Review post linking Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong with 1MDB investigations.

“We have a responsibility to handle any government request to restrict alleged misinformation carefully and thoughtfully, consistent with our approach to government requests around the world. We do not have a policy that prohibits alleged falsehoods, apart from in situations where this content has the potential to contribute to imminent violence or physical harm,” a Facebook spokesman said in response to queries from Channel NewsAsia.

The Facebook post shared an article alleging that Malaysia had signed several unfair agreements with Singapore in exchange for Singapore banks’ assistance in laundering 1MDB funds.

On Nov 9, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) denounced the article as ""baseless and defamatory"" and filed a police report over it. Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam said the allegations were ""absurd"".

On the same day, the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) issued an order for States Times Review to take down the article.

When it refused, the regulator directed Internet service providers in Singapore to restrict access to the website.

IMDA also asked Facebook to take down a post sharing the article, but the social media platform did not accede to the request.

In response, Singapore's Ministry of Law said that Facebook's stance showed that the social media platform ""cannot be relied upon to filter falsehoods or protect Singapore from a false information campaign"".

Speaking at a roundtable with media on Tuesday, Monika Bickert, vice president of product policy at Facebook, said: “We don’t have a policy of removing false content. We will generally try to counter the virality and surface educational content. There are those two exceptions, where it’s very tied to voter suppression or the imminent threat of physical violence in the offline world.

“Other than that, I will say that we do have a process through which governments can submit (something) to us if they think that something violates their laws and we have dialogues with governments back and forth on that. We have a legal team that analyses those requests and then we publish the results of those requests and whether we have removed content - we publish that in a report that we put out every six months.”

In September, Facebook - along with Google and Twitter - were singled out in a Select Committee report that made recommendations to the Government on how to tackle deliberate online falsehoods.

In particular, the committee called for legislation for measures to be taken in response to online falsehoods, ""since Facebook, Google and Twitter have a policy of generally not acting against content on the basis that it is false"".",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/facebook-refuse-take-down-states-times-review-post-pm-lee-10926422
FBI report shows spike in hate crimes for 3rd year in a row,FBI report shows spike in hate crimes for 3rd year in a row,0.0,"Hate crimes in the U.S. rose about 17 percent in 2017 compared to the previous year, according to data released Tuesday by the FBI. The Uniform Crime Reporting Program's Hate Crime Statistics report, which comprises incidents reported to the federal government by law enforcement agencies, shows 7,175 hate crime incidents in 2017 compared with 6,121 incidents in 2016. The 2017 incidents encompass 8,437 total offenses, meaning some involved multiple criminal charges.

The FBI notes, however, the number of law enforcement agencies reporting the crimes also increased, with about 1,000 additional agencies contributing data. This is the third year in a row the FBI has reported an increase in hate crimes — reports spiked about 5 percent between 2015 and 2016.

The vast majority of the incidents reported, 7,106, were ""single-bias"" hate-crime incidents, while 69 incidents stemmed from multiple biases. Of the ""single-bias"" hate crime incidents, which encompass 8,126 offenses, 8,493 victims, and 6,307 known offenders — the data shows:

The offenses were most commonly motivated by hatred over race, ethnicity or ancestry, at a rate of 59.6 percent



20.6 percent of the offenses were motivated by hatred over religion



15.8 percent stemmed from sexual orientation bias



Bias over disability comprised 1.9 percent



Gender identity hatred comprised 1.6 percent, and gender bias .6 percent



Most of the total 8,437 offenses — about 5,000 — were categorized as crimes against persons such as intimidation, assault, murder or rape, while about 3,000 were considered crimes against property such as vandalism, robbery or burglary. Some were categorized as both. Most — 78.3 percent — targeted individuals, while others targeted businesses, government entities or religious organizations.

Of crimes motivated by race, ancestry or ethnicity, about 48.8 percent were motivated by hatred against African Americans, 17.5 percent stemmed from bias against whites, and 10.9 percent were classified as anti-Latino or anti-Hispanic bias.

Of crimes motivated by hatred over religion, 58.1 percent targeted those of Jewish faith and 18.7 percent targeted those of Muslim faith, the report says. In 2016, 54.2 percent of hate crimes were anti-Jewish while 24.8 percent were anti-Muslim.

In a statement, Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker said he was ""particularly troubled by the increase in anti-Semitic hate crimes.""

""The American people can be assured that this department has already taken significant and aggressive actions against these crimes and that we will vigorously and effectively defend their rights,"" the statement said.

The FBI said the hate crime data ""allows the public, researchers, community leaders and local government to raise awareness of the issue and gain a more accurate picture of hate crimes,"" and also allows law enforcement to develop prevention strategies.

Whitaker called the report a ""call to action — and we will heed that call.""",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fbi-hate-crimes-increase-report-today-2018-11-13/
California's Camp Fire Becomes The Deadliest Wildfire In State History,California's Camp Fire Becomes The Deadliest Wildfire In State History,0.0,"California's Camp Fire Becomes The Deadliest Wildfire In State History

Fire investigators in Northern California say they found the human remains of 6 more individuals, bringing the death toll to at least 48 people who have died in the wildfire that burned through the town of Paradise with shocking speed, making the Camp Fire the deadliest wildfire in state history.

Fire crews are working to fight that blaze, along with another large wildfire in Southern California, where at least two deaths have been reported.

A new, fast moving fire has also erupted in San Bernardino County, about 55 miles east of Los Angeles. Aerial footage from KABC television shows people fleeing the flames.

Overall 50 people have perished in fires throughout the state.

The Camp Fire in Butte County, about 80 miles north of Sacramento, has now burned 130,000 acres and is 35 percent contained, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection reported Tuesday night. More than 5,600 personnel are fighting the blaze, which has destroyed more than 7,600 homes and 260 commercial buildings.

Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said officials have requested 100 National Guard troops to help in the search for more human remains.

""We want to be able to cover as much ground as quickly as we possibly can,"" said Honea, in the hopes that additional personnel could expedite the return of residents to their burned properties.

""I want to tell you, though, this is a very, very difficult process and there is certainly the unfortunate possibility that even after we've searched an area ... it's possible that human remains can be found,"" he added.

Honea also encouraged residents to notify the local district attorney's office if they believe they are victims of price gouging by anyone taking advantage of the disaster. He said he considered price gougers in the same category as looters.

The Camp Fire started last Thursday morning, growing explosively and forcing panicked evacuations. The fire stormed through Paradise, leaving behind near-total devastation. As of Monday night, nearly half of the evacuation centers in Chico, Oroville and nearby towns were at capacity.

""Last night firefighters continued to hold established containment lines,"" Cal Fire said in an update earlier on Tuesday. The agency said firefighters had ""worked aggressively"" to protect structures in the fire's path, and that they've been working to build fire lines to establish control. But it added that dry conditions and steep terrain will continue to pose a challenge.

More than 50,000 people have fled the Camp blaze, according to member station KQED. And even at a distance, the fire is posing health concerns: ""Air quality throughout the Bay Area remains in the 'unhealthy' zone, according to federal measurements,"" KQED reports, adding that the conditions should persist through Friday.

To follow ongoing updates from fire and safety officials about the damage to specific areas in the Camp fire, Cal Fire has published a searchable map that includes photos of affected areas, as work crews inspect neighborhoods.

Full information about evacuations and road closures is listed on the Cal Fire pages for the Camp fire and the Woolsey fire.

To the south, the Woolsey Fire has burned 97,114 acres and is 40 percent contained, Cal Fire said Tuesday evening. The fire that broke out in the Thousand Oaks area — which had already been coping with a mass shooting — is blamed for two deaths.

The Woolsey Fire is estimated to have destroyed 435 buildings. And according to Cal Fire, ""83 percent of all National Parks Service land in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area has been burned by the Woolsey Fire.""

Firefighters are still primarily focused on protecting life and structures, citing ""extreme fire behavior"" from the blaze that has drawn power from Santa Ana winds.

There are nearly 3,600 fire personnel fighting the Woolsey fire. The effort includes planes that scoop water from the ocean to drop on the flames — as a video posted to Twitter showed on Monday.

President Trump has approved an expedited request for a disaster declaration for the California fires, saying he wanted ""to respond quickly in order to alleviate some of the incredible suffering going on."" Trump added in a tweet, ""I am with you all the way. God Bless all of the victims and families affected.""

As for what caused the two deadly fires, that remains under investigation. As KQED has reported, two electric utility companies reported service problems just minutes before the Woolsey and Camp fires began. A spokeswoman for the California Public Utilities Commission tells the station that it will incorporate those reports into its investigation.

In June, the California forestry agency blamed 12 wildfires on downed power lines owned by utility giant Pacific Gas and Electric. And in October, Southern California Edison said its equipment was at least in part to blame for the Thomas Fire that burned more than 280,000 acres in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties last year.

The Camp Fire's death toll has grown in staggering leaps. The first notice came on Thursday, when investigators found the remains of five people in Paradise who were apparently trapped in their cars by the blaze. Four more were found on Friday, 20 more over the weekend and 13 more on Monday.

Before the Camp fire struck, the most deadly wildfire in California's history was the Griffith Park blaze, which killed 29 people in Los Angeles in 1933.

"Israelis, Palestinians brace for the worst as Gaza ceasefire kicks in","Israelis, Palestinians brace for the worst as Gaza ceasefire kicks in",0.0,"TEL AVIV, Israel — As Palestinian militants controlling the Gaza Strip exchanged fire with Israeli soldiers in the most intense fighting for years Tuesday, the people below the soaring rockets braced for further bloodshed.

The flare-up — seemingly triggered by a botched Israeli raid into Gaza on Sunday — killed seven Palestinians and one Israeli before a ceasefire was announced by militant groups.

A truce would provide much-needed respite for civilians either side of the fence between Israel and the blockaded Palestinian enclave.

Mohammad Al Hatoum said he tried to distract his two young daughters from Israeli airstrikes by playing cartoons on television with the volume turned up high. It didn't help.

“The bombing was so loud and my daughters didn’t stop crying,” said Al Hatoum, who is 33 and lives with his family in western Gaza.

The government employee not only heard the explosions, he smelled and felt them.

“I felt the entire building shaking,” he told NBC News, describing the effect as like a magnitude 7 earthquake.

Violence is nothing new for civilians inside the crowded and desperately-poor strip that has been run by Hamas militants since 2007, nor is it new to those in Israeli communities nearby. Israel has fought three wars in the enclave during the last decade and fears are growing that a new conflict is on the way.

Since Monday, Hamas and other armed factions fired over 400 rockets or mortars across the fenced border — the most intense rocket fire on Israel since the 2014 war — the Israeli military said. This came after militants carried out a missile attack on a bus that wounded an Israeli soldier.

This follows months of fires caused by hundreds of incendiary kites and explosive balloons sent from Gaza. The blazes have burned thousands of acres of nature reserves and farm lands.

On Tuesday, Israeli President Reuven Rivlin visited the border community of Netivot telling Israeli citizens to “take good care of themselves” and to follow the order of the Israel Defense Forces.

Israel’s Ministerial Committee on National Security Affairs issued a statement saying they had told the Israeli military to “continue its operations if necessary.”

The recent fighting appeared to have been set off by a botched Israeli special forces raid in Gaza Sunday that left seven Palestinians dead, including a local Hamas commander, as well as an Israeli army officer. Israel is on constant alert for militant tunnels and attacks emanating from Gaza.

Al Hatoum was born during the first Palestinian intifada, or uprising against Israel, and estimates he has spent almost half his life in the throes of bitter conflict. He is not hopeful for the future.

“There will be an escalation in Gaza, there will be no calm after this,” he said.

Israelis are also scared.

Hila Fenlon, who is a farmer in the small Israeli village of Netiv Haasara a few yards from the dividing fence, said her family is shaken by both Israeli and Palestinian fire.

She said she turned her children’s bedroom into a missile shelter so they could get to safety in time before the rockets fell.

“Whenever I hear the sirens, my heart skips a beat,” she said, explaining it was hard to persuade her children to stay in or near the shelter at all times.

“We feel like we’re in war all the time, not just the last couple of days,” she said. “My children are exposed to rockets, incendiary balloons and burnt land.”

Fenlon said she hoped for peace. “I wish we can go back to being neighbors like we used to,” she said.

Even before the exchange of fire of the last few days, fear reigned in what is known as the Gaza envelop — the area of Israel surrounding the Gaza Strip.

Adele Raemer, a 63-year-old ESL teacher who lives in the community of Nirim also on the border with Gaza, said there was little they could do.

""We are used to riding this roller coaster,"" Raemer said. ""Nobody likes the roller coaster, but we are on it. And the thing is — you never know when you are going to get on it and you never know when this ride is over.""

In Gaza, which can be seen from Nirim, desperation is a way of life.

Some 70 percent of Gaza's population are refugees or descendants of refugees, and a similar proportion depends on humanitarian aid. Those living there cannot leave without permission and the blockade has made life intolerable for many of Gaza’s 2 million residents.

Almost none of the water is clean, raw sewage is pumped straight into the sea and worsening power shortages mean Gazans have electricity for only around four hours a day on average. Unemployment rates are close to 50 percent — more than 65 percent among those under 30.

Since March, thousands of Palestinian protesters have marched towards the fence which separates Israel from the Gaza Strip demanding the right to enter Israel and reclaim homes their family left after the country was founded in 1948. Some 220 have been shot dead and around 24,000 wounded, according to Gazan health officials. Israel maintains many of those hurt and killed on the fence are in fact militants masquerading as peaceful protesters.

Despite regular violence, Ma’amoun Shawaf, a 23-year-old owner of a coffee shop in Khan Younis, knew Sunday night was “something big.”

On hearing gunfire and people shouting “Israeli forces, go back, go back,” Shawaf said he raced to the scene. “I started telling my friends that the war will start tonight.”

Bolton says Saudi crown prince not implicated in recording of Khashoggi killing,Bolton says Saudi crown prince not implicated in recording of Khashoggi killing,0.0,"National security adviser John Bolton on Tuesday said that an audio recording of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi’s killing does not appear to implicate Saudi Arabia's crown prince.

Speaking to reporters in Singapore, Bolton said that while he hasn’t heard the recording, “that’s not the conclusion that I think the people who heard it have come to,” according to The Wall Street Journal.

Bolton’s comments come after The New York Times reported Monday night that audio shared with the United States by Turkey includes a member of the kill team telling someone on the phone to “tell your boss,” adding words to the effect of “the deed was done.”

Citing three unnamed people familiar with the recording, the Times reported that American intelligence officials believe the “boss” in question is Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

The person who made the phone call was Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb, a former bodyguard for Crown Prince Mohammed, according to the Times.

Khashoggi, a Virginia resident and Washington Post columnist who often criticized the Saudi government, was killed on Oct. 2 when he went to the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul to get paperwork for his marriage to his Turkish fiancée.

Turkish officials have said Khashoggi was strangled almost immediately upon entering the consulate and that his body was then dismembered and disposed of.

The Saudis have denied Crown Prince Mohammed’s involvement in the plan to kill Khashoggi. But regional experts and Western officials are doubtful such an operation would have been carried out without the approval of Saudi Arabia’s day-to-day leader.

The incident has drawn eyes to the relationship between the U.S. and the kingdom.

U.S. lawmakers have called for sanctions, among other punitive measures, in response to the killing and have said the crown prince should not be spared if he is found to be involved.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said publicly for the first time Saturday that an audio recording of Khashoggi’s dying moments had been shared with the United States, as well as with Saudi Arabia, Britain, France and Germany.

“The recordings are really appalling,” Erdogan added Monday. “When the Saudi intelligence officer listened to the recordings, he was so shocked he said: ‘This one must have taken heroin. Only someone who takes who heroin would do this.’ ”

Turkish officials have steadily leaked information about the case to the media, increasing international pressure on Saudis. Erdogan has said the killing was ordered by the “highest levels” of the Saudi government, without accusing a specific official.

On Monday, Bolton told reporters the United States trusts Saudi Arabia to investigate the killing.

“We expect that they will continue the investigation and that’s very important to us and it’s very important to others in the region, too,” he said. “The president has made it very clear that he expects that we’re going to get the truth from the Saudis.”

He added that he does not expect the issue to affect arms sales to the kingdom.

“The president has also said that this is an incredibly important relationship that he wants to sustain and that he doesn’t see that affecting the arms sales,” Bolton said.",https://thehill.com/policy/defense/416401-bolton-says-saudi-crown-prince-not-implicated-in-recording-of-khashoggi

The woman, identified only as juror No. 1, came to court armed with a doctor’s note saying she couldn’t serve on the trial, which could last three to four months, the judge said.

“I got a handwritten letter which details medical issues that have been brought about by her selection,” Brooklyn federal Judge Brian Cogan told lawyers.

“This person has been anxious and upset since selection … If I were to ask further questions, it will result in a breakdown and crying.”

Juror No. 1 burst into tears last week upon learning she was among the seven women and five men picked as jurors in the trial for Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, the notorious leader of the dangerous Sinaloa drug cartel.

Cogan refused to let her off, saying he didn’t see any “real hardship there.”

Six alternates were also selected.

Instead of replacing the nervous juror with one of the alternates, lawyers on both sides agreed to select a fresh one, which they’ll do Tuesday morning.

Guzman, 61, wore a suit and blue tie and waved to his beauty queen wife, Emma Coronel Aispuro, who smiled back in the heavily secured courtroom. He shook hands with his legal team before taking a seat.

A second juror later complained that he’d lose out on income if he continued to serve despite being unemployed. The man was eventually dismissed as well.",https://nypost.com/2018/11/13/el-chapos-trial-delayed-by-anxious-juror-who-wants-off-the-case/
Japanese woman arrested in connection to stabbing death of US airman,Japanese woman arrested in connection to stabbing death of US airman,0.0,"A Japanese woman was arrested in connection to the death of a U.S. airman last week, who was fatally stabbed while at his off-base residence in Western Tokyo, the Air Force said in a statement.

Aria Saito, 27, was arrested by Japanese police on suspicion of attempted murder after Master Sgt. Nicholas Vollweiler, 35, from the 374th Airlift Wing was found with stab wounds on Friday. He later died at a hospital, according to the statement.

Police are expected to upgrade the charges, Stars and Stripes reported.

Japanese media said Saito allegedly told authorities that she killed Vollweiler because she did not want to end their relationship and that she “stabbed a man I was dating with a knife, aiming at his right neck,” Japanese broadcaster TBS reported according to Stars and Stripes.

The 27-year-old also said she planned to kill herself afterward, Japanese media reported.

“Master Sgt. Vollweiler was a truly valued Airmen of Team Yokota and he will be dearly missed by our community,” said Col. Otis Jones, 374th Airlift Wing Commander. “His family, friends, fellow defenders, and all of the Yokota community are in our prayers during this heartbreaking time.”

The Air Force said it is continuing its investigation into Vollweiler’s death alongside the Japanese National Police.

Vollweiler was from the Poconos in Pennsylvania and was stationed at Yokota Air Base in western Japan where he worked as a K-9 instructor, according to WNEP.

"Battles rage in Yemen's port city of Hodeida, trapping civilians in crossfire","Battles rage in Yemen's port city of Hodeida, trapping civilians in crossfire",0.0,"ADEN, Yemen — Street battles raged on Sunday in residential areas of Yemen's main port city of Hodeida, forcing some medical staff to flee the largest hospital, as Iranian-aligned Houthi insurgents tried to repel forces backed by a Saudi-led coalition.

The city on the Red Sea is an entry point for most of the country's food and relief supplies. The United Nations and aid groups have warned that a full-scale assault on Hodeida could trigger a famine in the already impoverished Arabian Peninsula state, which imports 90 percent of its food, according to the U.N.

Residents said they saw bodies of seven civilians killed in clashes in southern suburbs, with both sides using mortar shells, anti-aircraft guns and assault rifles in the fight. Fighting, which first started to intensify in June, has not yet reached the center of the city, according to Sarah Alzawqari, a spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross.

The coalition has renewed its offensive on Hodeida as Western allies, including the United States, called for a ceasefire to support U.N.-led efforts to end the nearly four-year war that has killed more than 10,000 and pushed the country to the brink of starvation. The Houthis control of much of the country, including the capital, Sanaa.

Medical sources at al-Thawra hospital told Reuters that several staff members and patients able to move had fled the complex. It was not immediately clear how many patients remained inside. There are around 25 to 30 people who can't be moved who are in the hospital's intensive care unit, according to the ICRC.

""The Houthis are reinforcing their positions near the hospital and that is what scared people,"" said one staff member.

Hospital spokesman Khaled Attiyah told Reuters that doctors and nurses continued their work in departments such as intensive care, the burns ward and the emergency room ""despite the panic.""

“The hospital is still able to get food and supplies that are needed, but if one party enters it or uses it for military purposes it will be a huge problem and dangerous for the people there,” said Alzawqari.

Last week, rights groups said the Houthis had raided the May 22 hospital in the city's eastern suburbs and posted gunmen on the roof, endangering doctors and patients.

More than two dozen senior Obama administration officials, including former National Security Advisor Susan Rice and former CIA Director John Brennan, called on President Donald Trump on Sunday to cease all support for the war.

In a telephone call with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Sunday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reiterated Washington's call for ""a cessation of hostilities and for all parties to come to the table to negotiate a peaceful solution to the conflict,"" the State Department said.

The U.N. humanitarian chief said last month that ""there is a clear and present danger of an imminent and great big famine engulfing Yemen.""

The World Food Program said its cargo vessels were still able to call at the port in Hodeida, but it didn’t have access to some silos where grain is stored. Pro-coalition forces took control on Saturday of Red Sea Mills, a main grains facility south of the port which holds about 51,000 tons of wheat, a U.N. aid group said.

""Around 60 shells fell inside the compound since the clashes reached that area few days ago but the silos and the grains were not touched,"" said Ali Reza Qureshi, Yemen's deputy director for the WFP.

""We hope the production will resume in the coming next two weeks as we get 21,000 tons monthly from those mills, otherwise we will have to import wheat flour,"" he told Reuters.

The WFP said last week it plans to double its food assistance program for Yemen, aiming to reach up to 14 million people ""to avert mass starvation.""

The coalition has said that wresting control of Hodeida would break the Houthis by cutting off their main supply line and force the group to the negotiating table to end the conflict, seen as a proxy war between Riyadh and Iran.

The alliance, which relies on the West for arms and intelligence, intervened in Yemen's war in 2015 to restore the internationally recognized government ousted by the Houthi movement, which controls the most populated areas of Yemen including the capital Sanaa.

U.N. special envoy Martin Griffiths has said he hopes to convene renewed peace talks by the end of the year after the last round of consultations collapsed in September.

The United Nations has no up-to-date estimate of the death toll in Yemen. It said in August 2016 that according to medical centers at least 10,000 people had been killed.",https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/battles-rage-yemen-s-port-city-hodeida-trapping-civilians-crossfire-n935116

"Young mother 'beaten to death' during drunken row, murder trial hears","Young mother 'beaten to death' during drunken row, murder trial hears",0.0,"YOUNG mother of three Nicola Collins (38) was beaten to death by her boyfriend after a row erupted following a three-day drinking session, a murder trial has heard.

The State claimed that Cathal O'Sullivan (44), who denies the murder of Ms Collins, inflicted multiple blunt force trauma injuries on the Kerry-born woman before her naked body was discovered in a Cork flat by emergency services.

Tom Creed SC, for the State, told Ms Justice Eileen Creedon and the Central Criminal Court jury of nine men and three women that the prosecution case is the defendant beat the young mother to death during a drunken row.

""The prosecution case is that Mr O'Sullivan killed Nicola Collins and that at the time he killed Nicola Collins, at the very least, he intended to cause her serious injury,"" he said.

""The prosecution case is that the accused beat Nicola Collins to death.""

Mr Creed said the trial will hear evidence that, when Ms Collins was discovered shortly after 3am in a flat at 6A Popham's Road, Farranree, Cork in the early hours of March 27 2017, she had multiple injuries visible to attending members of the emergency services.

The young mother was found lying naked on her back on the floor of the flat with her legs resting on a bed.

Blood spatters were found in both the bedroom and the bathroom of the flat.

Blood stained clothing was also found in the flat.

Ms Collins was later found to have a broken jaw, two missing front teeth, a serious head injury as well as injuries to her face, lips, neck, chest, arms and breast.

Assistant State Pathologist Dr Margaret Bolster conducted a post mortem examination at Cork University Hospital (CUH) and ruled that Ms Collins died from a serious head injury with subdural haematoma consistent with blunt force trauma to the head.

Dr Bolster also found signs of asphyxia on Ms Collins' neck.

Mr Creed said that the trial will hear evidence from a taxi driver who brought Ms Collins from her home at Clashduv on Cork's southside to Popham's Road on March 23 2017 that she had no visible sign of injury and looked ""well kept.""

The only people seen arriving and leaving on CCTV footage from the Popham's Road flat were the deceased and the defendant.

They had left the flat to go to a nearby off license to purchase alcohol.

""It will be apparent that that an amount of drink was consumed over these days by both parties,"" he said.

Ms Collins was last seen alive outside the flat at 11.24am on March 24, three days before she was pronounced dead at the scene.

Mr Creed said the defendant rang emergency services to alert them to Ms Collins condition at 3.05am on March 27.

However, Mr Creed said the jury will hear evidence that the defendant made two phone calls to a friend in the early hours of March 27 before he rang emergency services.

Those calls were made at 1.33am and 2.15am and one call lasted for 32 minutes.

Mr Creed said the defendant had conversations at the scene with various members of the emergency services.

""The effect of these conversations was that she (Ms Collins) arrived on the Thursday (March 23), there was a lot of drink and there was an altercation where Mr O'Sullivan said she got stuck into him and he dodged a blow.""

Mr O'Sullivan, who is originally from Charleville in north Cork, was first charged with Ms Collins murder before Cork District Court in August 2017.

In response to the murder charge, he replied: ""not guilty"".

The defendant appeared in court wearing a dark grey pin-stripe suit, white shirt and grey tie.

Ms Justice Creedon has warned the jury not to read any media reports about the case and not to check any matters in relation to it on either the Internet or via social media.

Ms Collins, a native of St Brendans Park in Tralee, Co Kerry had been living at Clashduv Road in the Togher area of Cork over recent years.

Ms Collins was found unresponsive in the Popham's Road flat at 3am on March 27 2017 which was located directly over a local GALA grocery store.

Paramedics were unable to revive her and she was pronounced dead at the scene.

The Garda investigation was upgraded to a murder probe following a post mortem examination at Cork University Hospital (CUH) by Assistant State Pathologist Dr Margaret Bolster.

The trial has already heard that a significant number of witnesses are scheduled to be called in evidence.

Ms Collins is survived by her parents, Kay and Michael, her sister, Carly, and her children, Nick, Adam and Michael.

The trial continues.

Climate change led to the demise of the ancient Indus valley civilisation,Climate change led to the demise of the ancient Indus valley civilisation,0.0,"The mystery surrounding what killed off the ancient Indus valley civilisation may finally have been solved.

Scientists say that climate change led to the advanced people's demise by driving them out of their cities, which were among the earliest ever built.

As seasonal rainfall dried up due to global warming, the Indus were forced into villages in the Himalayan foothills 4,000 years ago.

Within the next millennium these isolated village groups died off as their water supply diminished, researchers said.

They warned the find spells trouble for modern groups in the Middle East and Africa forced from their land by climate change.

Scroll down for video

Pictured is an archaeological site in Pakistan that was once a settlement built by the Indus valley civilisation

'It's remarkable, and there's a powerful lesson for today,' said study coauthor Dr Liviu Giosan, a researcher at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts.

'If you look at Syria and Africa, the migration out of those areas has some roots in climate change.

'This is just the beginning - sea level rise due to climate change can lead to huge migrations from low lying regions like Bangladesh, or from hurricane-prone regions in the southern US.

'Back then, the Harappans could cope with change by moving, but today, you'll run into all sorts of borders. Political and social convulsions can then follow.'

The Indus Civilisation, also known as the Harappans, was an advanced Bronze Age society that thrived in the Indus River Valley of what is now modern Pakistan.

Along with Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, it was one of three early civilisations of the Old World.

The Indus Valley Civilisation possessed considerable skills when it came to town planning and building, including toilets and baths (pictured), which were connected to a brick drainage system that ran along the streets

Among their settlements, researchers have previously uncovered the world's first known toilets, along with complex stone weights, drilled gemstone necklaces and exquisitely carved seal stone.

The civilisation died out around 4,000 years ago, and researchers have spent decades trying to understand why.

Researchers studied sediment samples taken from the ocean floor at several sites in the Arabian Sea off Pakistan's coast.

WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE INDUS VALLEY CIVILISATION? The Indus Civilisation, also known as the Harappan Civilisation, was an advanced Bronze Age society. It developed mainly in the northwestern regions of South Asia from 5,300 to 3,300 years ago. The Indus cities were at their richest between and 2600 and 1900 BC. Along with Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, it was one of three early civilisations of the Old World. The Indus occupied the Indus River Valley area in modern Pakistan and India The Empire stretched from the Arabian Sea to the Ganges, over what is now Pakistan, India and Afghanistan. At its peak, the civilisation may have had a population of more than 5 million, making up 10 per cent of the world's population. Among their settlements, researchers have uncovered the world's first known toilets, along with complex stone weights, drilled gemstone necklaces and exquisitely carved seal stone. Etched in of these artefacts is an unusual and complex script, which researchers are racing to decipher. Why the Civilisation disappeared around 3,000 years ago remains a msytery, but experts have suggested war, famine or even climate change could have been responsible. Advertisement

They examined fragments of ancient DNA found in the sediments to give them clues about what organisms thrived in the region during the summer and winter.

'The seafloor near the mouth of the Indus is a very low-oxygen environment, so whatever grows and dies in the water is very well preserved in the sediment,' Dr Giosan said.

'You can basically get fragments of DNA of nearly anything that's lived there.'

Their findings showed that winter monsoons in the area intensified around 2500 BC, while summer monsoons dried up.

This was evident in the sediment DNA as strong winds brought nutrients from the deeper ocean to the surface, feeding a surge in plant and animal life.

WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT THE INDUS' CITIES? The Indus Valley Civilisation possessed considerable skills when it came to town planning and building. The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro are laid out in grids, with individual homes supplied with water from wells and waste water diverted to covered drains. This is perhaps the world's first known sanitation system. Some houses had two storeys, a bath and a courtyard. The needs of citizens were catered for with municipal buildings, marketplaces, dockyards, granaries, warehouses and protective walls to shield inhabitants from floods and attack. Unlike in other early human civilisations, no evidence of temples or palaces have been found, yet evidence suggests the Indus had a social hierarchy. It's thought most city dwellers were traders or artisans, with elaborate pottery, beads and metalwork recovered. Advertisement

Likewise, weaker winds other times of year provide fewer nutrients, causing slightly less productivity in the waters offshore.

By 1800 BC, the Indus had abandoned their cities as agriculture in the huge urban areas became impossible, moving to smaller villages in the Himalayan foothills.

The rains in the foothills were enough to hold the rural Harapans over for the next millennium, but even those eventually dried up, likely contributing to their demise.

""We can't say that they disappeared entirely due to climate - at the same time, the Indo-Aryan culture was arriving in the region with Iron Age tools and horses and carts,' Dr Giosan said.

'But it's very likely that the winter monsoon played a role.'",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-6385185/Climate-change-led-demise-ancient-Indus-valley-civilisation.html
Warmer winter temperatures related to higher crime rates,Warmer winter temperatures related to higher crime rates,0.0,"Milder winter weather increased regional crime rates in the United States over the past several decades, according to new research that suggests crime is related to temperature's effect on daily activities.

A new study published in GeoHealth, a journal of the American Geophysical Union, finds U.S. crime rates are linked to warmer temperatures, and this relationship follows a seasonal pattern.

The findings support the theory that three major ingredients come together to bring about crime: a motivated offender, a suitable target, and the absence of a guardian to prevent a violation of the law. During certain seasons, namely winter, milder weather conditions increase the likelihood these three elements come together, and that violent and property crimes will take place, according to the new study. Unexpectedly, warmer summer temperatures were not linked with higher crime rates.

The new research abates existing theories that hot temperatures drive aggressive motivation and behavior, according to the study's authors. Instead, the new research suggests crime is related to the way climate alters people's daily activities.

""We were expecting to find a more consistent relationship between temperature and crime, but we weren't really expecting that relationship to be changing over the course of the year,"" said Ryan Harp, lead author of the study and a doctoral candidate in the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder. ""That ended up being a pretty big revelation for us.""

Understanding how climate affects crime rates could expand the boundaries of what scientists would consider to be a climate and health connection, Harp said.

""Ultimately, it's a health impact,"" he said. ""The relationship between climate, human interaction, and crime that we've unveiled is something that will have an impact on people's wellbeing.""

Regional climate affects human interaction

Previous studies have found a link between temperature and the incidence of crime, but none have looked at the relationship on a regional level and only some have controlled for underlying seasonal changes, allowing researchers to identify the potential underlying mechanism.

In the new study, Harp and his co-author conducted a systematic investigation into the relationship between large-scale climate variability and regionally-aggregated crime rates, using a technique that allowed them to group together detailed spatial data on seasonal temperature and crime rates from across the United States.

They compared crime and climate data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR). The data encompassed 16,000 cities across five defined US regions--Northeast, Southeast, South Central, West, and Midwest--from 1979 to 2016.

Their finding that violent crime is almost always more prevalent when temperatures are warmer in the winter months was especially notable in areas with the strongest winters, like the Midwest and Northeast, according to the researchers.

The new findings showing that increasing temperatures matter more in the winter than in the summer is interesting, said Marshall Burke, assistant professor of Earth System Science at Stanford University, who was not involved with the new study.

""The authors rightly suggest that this is more consistent with warmer temperatures altering people's patterns of activity, like going outside more, than a physiological story about temperature and aggression,"" he said.

According to social media Mr Griffin became a father in December 2106.

A Taliban suicide bomber detonated a huge car bomb at the entrance of the compound belonging to British security firm G4S before three others stormed in.

All of the terrorists were killed in the ensuing gun battle.

Colonel Bismillah Taban, the local police chief, said the majority of those killed and injured inside the compound were hurt in the initial blast.

Images released on Thursday show a huge crater where the gates used to stand after a suicide bomber detonated his explosives.

A G4S spokesman said: 'It is with great sadness that we can confirm that five of our employees were killed and 32 were injured, five of them seriously, in an unprovoked, criminal attack on one of our compounds in Kabul on 28 November 2018.

'Next of kin have been informed and our thoughts at this difficult time are with the loved ones of those who have died and been injured, and our brave team in Afghanistan who have lost colleagues and friends.

'We are offering support and counselling to all of those affected.'

A British Foreign Office spokesman added: 'We are working closely with G4S following the attack on its facilities in Kabul, which led to the death of five of its workers, including one British national.'

The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack saying it was in retaliation for an earlier US airstrike which killed at least 30 people, including civilians and children.

A Taliban spokesman said the attack was in revenge for an earlier US airstrike in Helmand province which had killed civilians and children

Afghan special forces had come under heavy fire from Taliban fighters during a night operation in Helmand province.

They then requested airstrikes against Taliban positions, prompting the Americans to swoop in.

Afghan and Western officials said 16 members of the Taliban were killed, but admitted there were civilian casualties. They put the number at 16, but locals reported 22 civilian deaths.

Basir Mujahid, spokesman for the Kabul police chief, says the Taliban targeted G4S because the company offers training for Afghan security forces.

The complex attack on a well-protected site underlines how insecure Kabul remains despite efforts by the United States and the Afghan government to open peace talks with the Taliban to end more than 17 years of war.

The insurgents' main spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the attack had caused heavy casualties and had been launched in retaliation for casualties caused by security forces in the southern provinces of Helmand and Kandahar.

G4S, one of the world's biggest security groups, is one of a number of foreign security contractors operating in Afghanistan and provides guards for the area around the British embassy.

An official from the public health ministry said 11 wounded had been taken to city hospitals and reporters saw at least one dead body but gathering accurate casualty figures was hampered by the continuing fighting.

Earlier the president, who faces a re-election battle next year, told a U.N.-sponsored conference in Geneva of plans to appoint a team to seek a peace deal, which he said would take at least five years to implement.

Efforts to open talks with the insurgents have picked up following the appointment of U.S. special peace envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, but the violence that kills thousands every year has continued.

Three U.S. service members were killed close to the central city of Ghazni on Tuesday and at least 30 Afghan civilians were killed in a U.S. air strike overnight, officials and local residents said.

Last week, more than 50 people were killed in Kabul when a suicide bomber attacked a banquet hall where a meeting of religious leaders was taking place.

Security officials have warned that violence is likely to escalate alongside peace moves as the Taliban seeks to strengthen its position before any formal negotiations.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6441811/One-Briton-killed-five-injured-Taliban-suicide-bomb-attack-Kabul.html
"Global food system is broken, say world’s science academies","Global food system is broken, say world’s science academies",0.0,"The global food system is broken, leaving billions of people either underfed or overweight and driving the planet towards climate catastrophe, according to 130 national academies of science and medicine across the world.

Providing a healthy, affordable, and environmentally friendly diet for all people will require a radical transformation of the system, says the report by the InterAcademy Partnership (IAP). This will depend on better farming methods, wealthy nations consuming less meat and countries valuing food which is nutritious rather than cheap.

The report, which was peer reviewed and took three years to compile, sets out the scale of the problems as well as evidence-driven solutions.

The global food system is responsible for a third of all greenhouse gas emissions, which is more than all emissions from transport, heating, lighting and air conditioning combined. The global warming this is causing is now damaging food production through extreme weather events such as floods and droughts.

The food system also fails to properly nourish billions of people. More than 820 million people went hungry last year, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, while a third of all people did not get enough vitamins. At the same time, 600 million people were classed as obese and 2 billion overweight, with serious consequences for their health. On top of this, more than 1bn tonnes of food is wasted every year, a third of the total produced.

“The global food system is broken,” said Tim Benton, professor of population ecology, at the University of Leeds, who is a member of one of the expert editorial groups which produced the report. He said the cost of the damage to human health and the environment was much greater than the profits made by the farming industry.

“Whether you look at it from a human health, environmental or climate perspective, our food system is currently unsustainable and given the challenges that will come from a rising global population that is a really [serious] thing to say,” Benton said.

Reducing meat and dairy consumption is the single biggest way individuals can lessen their impact on the planet, according to recent research. And tackling dangerous global warming is considered impossible without massive reductions in meat consumption.

Research published in the journal Climate Policy shows that at the present rate, cattle and other livestock will be responsible for half of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, and that to prevent this will require “substantial reductions, far beyond what are planned or realistic, from other sectors”.

“It is vital [for a liveable planet] that we change our relationship with meat, especially with red meat. But no expert in this area is saying the world should be vegan or even vegetarian,” said Benton.

Rearing cattle and other livestock causes the same carbon emissions as all the world’s vehicles, trains, ships and planes combined. “We have spent 30 to 40 years investing quite heavily on fuel efficiency in the transport sector,” said Benton. “We need do something similarly radical in the farming sector and the scope for doing that by changing the way we raise the animals is much smaller than the scope we have by changing our diets.”

The IAP report notes that in poorer countries meat, eggs and dairy can be important in providing concentrated nutrients, especially for children. It also says other things livestock can provide should be taken into consideration, such as leather, wool, manure, transport and plough pulling.

The UN climate change conference, COP24, which starts on Sunday in Katowice, Poland, is an opportunity for political action, said Joachim von Braun, a professor who co-chairs the IAP project. “Our food systems are failing us. Agriculture and consumer choices are major factors driving disastrous climate change.”

Another member of the IAP editorial group, Aifric O’Sullivan, from University College Dublin, said: “We need to ensure that policymakers inform consumers about the climate impacts of their food choices, provide incentives for consumers to change their diets, and reduce food loss and waste.”

The report recommends many actions that could help deliver the “whole-scale root and branch transformation” that is required, said Benton. These include crops that are more resilient to climate change, smarter crop rotation, soil protection, precier use of fertilisers and less use of pesticides. It also backs innovation such as laboratory-grown meat and insect-based foods.",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/28/global-food-system-is-broken-say-worlds-science-academies
Home Routers Under Attack by NSA-Spawned Malware: What to Do,Home Routers Under Attack by NSA-Spawned Malware: What to Do,0.0,"Remember: You're not paranoid if they're actually watching you.

If you have an older home wireless router with the Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) protocol activated, there is a substantial chance that the router may have fallen prey to malware developed by none other than the U.S. National Security Agency.

(Image credit: NSA headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland. Credit: National Security Agency)

The good news is that the NSA is not actually behind this nefarious plot. The bad news is that some very crafty cybercriminals are, and fixing the problem isn't easy, if you can spot it at all.

What you should do is factory-reset your router, disable UPnP, then check for firmware updates, since some companies have patched the vulnerability out. This won’t fix any other compromised systems, but it’s a necessary first step.

MORE: The One Router Setting Everyone Should Change (But No One Does)

After that, you can factory-reset any other internet-connected device that you’re concerned about. You might also want to just buy a new router, as recent models do not appear to be susceptible to this type of attack.

This information comes from a blog post entitled ""UPnProxy: EternalSilence"" penned by researchers at Cambridge, Massachusetts-based data management firm Akamai. It draws from an earlier white paper that goes into the attack method in great detail.

The details are complicated, but here's a summary: Cybercriminals have learned how to take advantage of the UPnP protocols on older routers and get past the routers to directly attack Windows PCs on home and small-business networks. Akamai has dubbed this flaw “UPnProxy.” The most recent slew of attacks comes from an exploit that Akamai calls “EternalSilence” in a nod to the NSA-developed “Eternal” family of malicious code injections.

The bottom line is clear enough: Your router is the gateway to every connected device in your home, from your computer, to your phone, to your smart TV, to your smart light bulbs. If your router has been compromised, it’s possible that every other device in your home has followed suit.

Unfortunately, checking to see if you’ve been infected is hard, as antivirus software doesn’t normally scan routers. (A few products have begun to do so.) If malware makes it as far as your computer or game console, though, it’ll be easier to notice.

MORE: How to Update Your Router's Firmware

Cryptocurrency mining is a common cybercriminal tactic, as is drafting a system into a botnet. Either one will have a significant impact on performance, and will indicate that it’s time to back up your data and factory-reset the device.

As for the router itself, first check the earlier Akamai report to see if your system is vulnerable to UPnProxy. Dozens of routers could fall prey to this scheme, including models from Asus, D-Link and Netgear. The majority of models listed, though, are business-oriented devices that are popular in Europe and Asia, such as those from Axler, EFM, Netis and Ubiquiti.

If your router is on this list, just disabling UPnP might not be enough. If your system has already been infected, this would be the equivalent of closing the barn door after the horses have fled.

While Akamai doesn’t have hard numbers for how many devices have been compromised already, it estimates that there are at least 277,000 vulnerable routers in use right now. Of those, 45,000 are definitely infected. Extrapolating out for the number of devices connected to each router, that’s 1.7 million machines that are either infected, or at serious risk of being infected.

Akamai is not exactly sure what cybercriminals are doing with the infected machines, but cryptocurrency mining and botnet-drafting, as mentioned above, are always popular options. If an attacker chooses to inject more aggressive malware into a machine, the malware could steal usernames, passwords, financial information and more.

As for EternalSilence itself, it does indeed have a connection to the data-hungry NSA. The government agency developed a piece of malware called EternalBlue a few years ago, most likely in order to target enemies of the state through their computers.

But after the malware leaked online, cybercriminals began adapting it for their own use, notably in the pernicious WannaCry and NotPetya ransomware attacks. EternalSilence is a modification of EternalRed, which is in turn a modification of EternalBlue.

So there you have it: A piece of malware descended from a U.S. government project is now compromising routers all around the world, as well as any machine that’s connected to them. The diagnosis is complicated, and the fix is even more difficult.

As always, your best course of action is simply to buy high-quality routers in the first place, then keep the firmware on every machine you own updated as often as possible.

Climate change could trigger an 'extinction domino effect' that would annihilate all life on Earth,Climate change could trigger an 'extinction domino effect' that would annihilate all life on Earth,0.0,"Climate change increases the risk of an 'extinction domino effect' that could annihilate all life on Earth, researchers have warned.

The theory, known as 'co-extinctions', means an organism dies out because it depends on another doomed species.

Researchers say the end of all life is a worst case scenario, but warn the 'domino effect' could dramatically increase the risks of climate change - and found 5-6 degrees of average warming globally is enough to wipe out most life on the planet.

Scroll down for video

The European Commission study simulated 2,000 'virtual earths' linking animal and plant species, and found the loss of one species could trigger catastrophic knock on effects.

WHAT IS 'CO-ENTINCTION'? Researchers use the example of a plant's flower pollinated by only one species of bee. If the bee becomes extinct, so too will the plant eventually. The loss of one species can amplify the effects of environmental change on the remainder, the report found. Advertisement

'Even the most resilient species will inevitably fall victim to the synergies among extinction drivers as extreme stresses drive ecosystems to collapse,' says lead author Dr Giovanni Strona of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre based in Ispra in northern Italy.

Researchers from Italy and Australia simulated 2,000 'virtual earths' linking animal and plant species.

Using sophisticated modelling, they subjected the virtual earths to catastrophic environmental changes that ultimately annihilated all life.

The catastrophes they simulated included runaway global warming, scenarios of 'nuclear winter' following the detonation of multiple atomic bombs, and a large asteroid impact.

'What we were trying to test is whether the variable tolerances to extreme global heating or cooling by different species are enough to explain overall extinction rates,'

'But because all species are connected in the web of life, our paper demonstrates that even the most tolerant species ultimately succumb to extinction when the less-tolerant species on which they depend disappear.'

'Failing to take into account these co-extinctions therefore underestimates the rate and magnitude of the loss of entire species from events like climate change by up to 10 times,' says co-author Professor Bradshaw of Flinders University in South Australia.

Professor Bradshaw and Dr Strona say that their virtual scenarios warn humanity not to underestimate the impact of co-extinctions.

'Not taking into account this domino effect gives an unrealistic and exceedingly optimistic perspective about the impact of future climate change', warns Professor Bradshaw.

CLIMATE CHANGE 'BIGGEST GLOBAL HEALTH THREAT' Rising heat and wilder weather linked to climate change make it 'the biggest global health threat of the 21st century', with hundreds of millions more people already suffering in the last two decades, medical officials warned Wednesday. In a hard-hitting report published by The Lancet medical journal, scientists and health experts said climate change impacts - from heatwaves to worsening storms, floods and fires - were surging and threatened to overwhelm health systems. 'That's the thing that really keeps me up at night,' said Nick Watts, executive director of The Lancet Countdown, an annual report tracking connections between public health and climate change. Storms and floods, for instance, do not only cause direct injuries but can also shut down hospitals, spur disease outbreaks and produce lingering mental health problems, as people lose their homes, he said. Wildfires, similarly, hurt and uproot people, but also dramatically worsen air pollution in broad areas. The Lancet report, produced by doctors, academics and policy experts from 27 organisations around the world, called for fast action to curb climate change and prepare global health systems for growing challenges. 'A rapidly changing climate has dire implications for every aspect of human life, exposing vulnerable populations to extremes of weather, altering patterns of infectious disease and compromising food security, safe drinking water and clean air,' it warned.

'By comparing scenarios of extinctions based only on species’ environmental tolerances with others accounting also for co-extinctions, we show that neglecting to consider the cascading effect of biodiversity loss leads to a large overestimation of the robustness of planetary life to global change,' the team wrote.

'Another really important discovery was that in the case of global warming in particular, the combination of intolerance to heat combined with co-extinctions mean that 5-6 degrees of average warming globally is enough to wipe out most life on the planet', says Dr Strona.

Professor Bradshaw further warns that their work shows how climate warming creates extinction cascades in the worst possible way, when compared to random extinctions or even from the stresses arising from nuclear winter.",https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-6444117/Climate-change-trigger-extinction-domino-effect-annihilate-life-Earth.html

A makeup artist who went on a natural health kick needed emergency surgery when she felt her ""body shutting down"" after using an organic tampon.

Waking up with a pounding headache and feeling like she had been hit by a truck on 15 January, 2018, Kristina Makris visited a walk-in clinic on the advice of her mum Diane, 63.

The 33-year-old was sent home to rest with suspected flu, but woke up in her home in Massachusetts, USA shivering and ""looking like death"".

Diane drove Kristina - by then vomiting bile non-stop into a bin bag - straight to Lahey Hospital where she endured a ""torture"" like 30 minute wait in the emergency room.

She said: ""I could feel my body shutting down, it was my worst nightmare.

""Doctors pumped me with four different antibiotics and fluids to raise my blood pressure, making me gain 30lb in fluids.

“I still had no idea what was wrong with me, and it seemed that the doctors weren’t sure either.”

Kristina had recently switched to using organic tampons, but began feeling ‘under the weather’ two weeks after her period ended.

The Monday before she had been very sick, also noticing she had a swollen lump on her groin.

Having assumed she was suffering from a gym injury or temporary illness after switching to a vegan diet, Kristina became increasingly concerned as her condition got worse.

She said: “I could feel it in my soul that something was terribly wrong.

""I was so weak I had to text my mum downstairs. I couldn’t even shout for her.

“Once she had run upstairs and seen me, she looked terrified, and immediately took me to the car.”

After being given the blood pressure medication and antibiotics at hospital she was still no better, feeling as though her organs were in agony.

“I begged the nurses for painkillers and even threatened to find some and take them myself,"" she said.

“I was so angry and terrified, I didn’t know how to react.”

With the rash on her leg spreading fast and her vital signs getting weaker, at around 1am the next morning Kristina was moved to the intensive care unit.

She said: “I just remember the surgical team running towards me and telling me I had 45 minutes to make a decision about whether or not to have surgery.

“I was so confused, I didn’t know what to say, or why I even needed surgery, until I was told I needed the procedure immediately or I would lose my left leg.”

(Image: PA Real Life)

When Kristina woke following surgery a day later she instantly saw the surgeon and, as she couldn't speak, because of a breathing tube, wrote him a note on a white board saying: ""Thank you for saving my life.""

Her mum and dad, Milton, 66, were also there when she woke up - delighted to see Kristina with her eyes open again.

Three days later doctors told Kristina the rash on her leg had gone septic and that she had suffered from toxic shock.

Working back through everything she had used in the days leading up to the ordeal Kristina and the doctors realised the organic tampons she recently bought were likely the cause.

Kristina added: “Because they were incredibly dry, as I pulled one out after use, I'd managed to scratch the wall inside my vagina, leaving it open to infection.

“It never once occurred to me that I could have lost my life due to something so simple.”

After spending two weeks in hospital Kristina was discharged, but then spent another three months getting her strength back at home.

She was forced to wear a wound vac – a small hand-held device fitted with a plastic tube, used to clear the infection on her thigh - and had a nurse visit her home to clean the wound every other day.

Kristina lost more than three stone in six weeks and suffered from emotional lows following the adrenalin boost her body triggered as it fought to stay alive.

(Image: PA Real Life)

She added: “Meanwhile, all the bile I threw up has ruined my teeth and enamel and I don’t think they’ll ever feel the same again.”

Since the shocking incident, doctors have advised Kristina to never use tampons again - and, too terrified to anyway, she has moved on to sanitary pads.

She said: “I hardly knew anything about toxic shock, apart from that when I was 12 and began my period, I was told to never leave a tampon in for too long.

“I followed all the rules but this still happened to me. Now I feel trauma when I see a tampon.""

Emma Soos, a registered nurse and MD of the Women’s Health Clinic, says that organic or not, all tampons can be dangerous.

She said: ""The main reason women get toxic shock is the fact that they leave tampons in for too long.

""Organic or not, the risks are the same, but if you have changed the brand of tampon you use, it could cause a reaction if you an unfamiliar to anything different used in that product.

""In Kristina's case, it could be down to how absorbent the product was - but we likely cannot pin it to down to one particular cause in this case.""",https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/makeup-artist-health-kick-almost-13666940
Grizzly bear mauls mother and young daughter outside remote Canada cabin,Grizzly bear mauls mother and young daughter outside remote Canada cabin,0.0,"A woman and her baby daughter are dead after a grizzly bear attack outside a remote cabin in northwest Canada on Monday, officials said. The Yukon Coroner's Service said Tuesday the child's father killed the bear before making the horrific discovery.

Chief Coroner Heather Jones said in statement 37-year-old Valérie Théorêt and her 10-month-old daughter Adele Roesholt were apparently out for a walk near the cabin Monday between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. when the bear mauled them.

Gjermund Roesholt, the husband, returned to the cabin after trapping in the afternoon. When he was about 300 feet away, the bear charged him and he shot the animal dead, according to Jones. He then came across the bodies of his wife and child before making the call to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP).

The family had been trapping in the Einarson Lake area for the past three months. The lake is near Mayo, a village about 250 miles north of Whitehorse, Yukon's capital.

CBC News, a partner of CBS News, reports Théorêt was on maternity leave from her job teaching French at a grammar school in Whitehorse. Her friends were heartbroken over the news.

""It's a big, big blow,"" friend Rémy Beaupré told the network. ""Everybody is totally devastated right now.""

The coroner continues to investigate the bear attack, along with Yukon's department of environment and RCMP.

Youngest kids in class may be over-diagnosed with ADHD,Youngest kids in class may be over-diagnosed with ADHD,0.0,"Does being the youngest in the class up your child's odds of being erroneously diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)?

It might. New research suggests these kids appear to be about 30 percent more likely to receive a diagnosis of ADHD. However, it probably doesn't change a child's actual risk of developing ADHD.

So if your child was an August baby and your school district has a Sept. 1 birth date cutoff for school admissions, your child will be one of the youngest in class. And, particularly in the early grades, those age gaps can make a big difference in behavior, researchers said.

""Physicians should take into account a child's age relative to their peers. Behavior that is normal for a child's age may appear anomalous when compared to older peers,"" explained study author Timothy Layton, an assistant professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School.

The consequences from not factoring in age might be overdiagnosis and overtreatment of the disorder, according to Layton. He noted that kids born in August (in areas with a September birthday cutoff) were also more likely to be given medication for ADHD symptoms.

ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder that's common in children, but it may not always last into adulthood, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Kids with ADHD may have trouble controlling their behavior, may act impulsively and may be overly active, the CDC says.

ADHD rates have been rising sharply among America's youth. Over the past two decades, the rate of ADHD jumped from 6 percent to 10 percent, according to a recent study from the University of Iowa.

In children between ages 2 and 5, the rate of ADHD diagnosis went up by 50 percent between 2007 and 2012, according to background information from the study. In 2016, more than 5 percent of U.S. children were being treated with medication for ADHD.

There's no single test that can diagnose ADHD, the CDC says. Instead, doctors must rely on a medical exam, along with information from parents, teachers and, sometimes, the child. Doctors have to rule out other disorders that can cause symptoms similar to ADHD.

To see how a child's birth date might affect the risk of being diagnosed with ADHD, the researchers reviewed data from a large insurance database with information on more than 400,000 youngsters from 50 states. The kids were born between 2007 and 2009, and followed through 2015.

In states that had a Sept. 1 cutoff date for starting kindergarten, the researchers found that 85 out of 10,000 August-born youngsters were diagnosed with ADHD. For those born in September, the ADHD rate was 64 per 10,000 kids.

When the researchers looked at treatment for ADHD, they found that 53 out of 10,000 children born in August were getting ADHD medication, compared to 40 out of 10,000 kids born in September.

Layton said these findings would likely hold true in districts that had other cutoff dates for starting school. For example, in a school with a Dec. 1 birthday cutoff for school entry, kids born in November would probably be more likely to receive an ADHD diagnosis than kids born in December.

Dr. Andrew Adesman, chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at Cohen Children's Medical Center in New Hyde Park, N.Y., said, ""This nicely designed study has confirmed what several other investigators have likewise demonstrated -- that the youngest children within a grade are more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD than are the oldest children in that same grade.""

Adesman, who was not part of the study, said that if the researchers looked at kids closer in age in the same grade, say, just a few months apart, the differences would likely be smaller.

He said this study suggests that parents of kids who are young for their grade who have ADHD symptoms may want to consider having their child repeat a grade. This might give a child time to mature, so he or she will behave more appropriately in school.

The findings were published Nov. 28 in the New England Journal of Medicine.",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/adhd-youngest-kids-in-class-may-be-over-diagnosed-with-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder/
Mothers' drinking may have harmed 1 in 5 Britons,Mothers' drinking may have harmed 1 in 5 Britons,0.0,"(CNN) A new study has found that more children in the UK may have been affected by their mothers drinking alcohol while pregnant than previously thought.

Research published Friday found that up to 17% of children could have symptoms found in fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, a group of lifelong conditions caused by exposure to alcohol in the womb.

FASD, also known as fetal alcohol syndrome, can cause a variety of developmental delays and physical symptoms, including a smaller head than average, poor growth, cerebral palsy, learning difficulties and autism, according to the NHS

To reach their conclusions, scientists from the University of Bristol and Cardiff University assessed the development of 13,495 children from data in Bristol's Children of the 90s study, a population-based cohort study that recruited pregnant women from the southern English city with expected delivery dates between 1991 and 1992.

The Children of the 90s study ""also used a range of comprehensive measures like physical tests of growth and psychological assessments"" on the children, the study's lead researcher, Cheryl McQuire from the University of Bristol, told CNN.

The UK has the fourth highest level of pre-natal alcohol use in the world, and various estimates of the disorder in Britain only ""looked at a sub-type [of FASD], which is the type with facial symptoms,"" McQuire said.

""So we know drinking in this country is high, but we didn't know the potential number of people who had symptoms from the full FASD,"" she added.

FASD is also considered a relatively hidden disability because most individuals with it do not show physical features. It is also thought to be under-diagnosed in Britain.

The research found drinking was common among pregnant women; ""79% reported drinking some alcohol during pregnancy, with 25% reported of drinking at binge levels,"" McQuire said.

While the screening measures used in the study do not equate to formal diagnoses, she said the findings show FASD is more common in the UK than first thought.

""If we fail to diagnose it then those affected individuals will continue to be affected by a lack of support and have subsequent impact on them and wider service,"" Raja Mukherjee, a doctor who contributed to the report and runs a diagnostic clinic for FASD, said in a statement. ""These results can be the first step in helping us in the UK to realise it is no longer a condition we can ignore.""

The charity British Pregnancy Advisory Service disputed the study's findings, arguing only 223 of the 13,495 people studied had full data sets, the charity said in a press release

could cause ""undue panic, particularly as many pregnancies are unplanned, and paves the way for unwarranted and inappropriate interventions"" like abortion. It also warned that the findingscould cause ""undue panic, particularly as many pregnancies are unplanned, and paves the way for unwarranted and inappropriate interventions"" like abortion.

Some researchers praised the study, but others questioned its use as a guide to how common the condition is in the UK.

""I would consider this research to be of high quality from a recognized authoritative source,"" said Christopher Steer, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. ""The figure of 17% is certainly strikingly high, well above previous indirect indications pointing to levels of between 2% and 5%.""

""This research provides some potentially very useful information relating to FASD, but I really don't think it tells us anything very helpful about how common these conditions are in the UK,"" said Kevin McConway, emeritus professor of applied statistics at the Open University in London.

""The researchers used a screening tool that they had developed, which classified between 6% and 17% of the 13,500 children in their study as having symptoms of FASD, depending on which exact method they used,"" he explained.

AFM: CDC identifies 31 states with 116 confirmed cases of polio-like disease,AFM: CDC identifies 31 states with 116 confirmed cases of polio-like disease,0.0,"(CNN) There are now 286 cases of possible and confirmed acute flaccid myelitis in the United States this year, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

That includes 116 confirmed cases of the rare polio-like illness, also known as AFM, that leads to sudden onset of paralysis. That's 10 more confirmed cases than the agency reported a week ago. An additional 170 possible cases of AFM are under investigation.

Since 2014 there have been 440 confirmed cases of AFM, most of them children. More than 95% of the patients with AFM this year have been children younger than age 18. The average age of those infected is 5, according to the CDC. Most of the children with confirmed cases experienced a viral illness with symptoms including fever and cough about three to 10 days before the onset of paralysis, the CDC said this month

The patients with confirmed AFM are in 31 states, which the CDC has now identified for the first time. There are 15 cases in Colorado, the state with the highest number, followed by Texas with 14 confirmed cases. Nineteen states have no confirmed cases, and 12 states are reporting only one confirmed case, according to the CDC.

It's not clear whether there is more of a risk of AFM in states that have a higher number of cases or if those states are just better at identifying and reporting patients. Although the CDC has encouraged doctors to report cases, there is no requirement to do so.

Google’s Parent Has a Plan to Eliminate Mosquitoes Worldwide,Google’s Parent Has a Plan to Eliminate Mosquitoes Worldwide,0.0,"(Bloomberg) -- Silicon Valley researchers are attacking flying bloodsuckers in California's Fresno County. It's the first salvo in an unlikely war for Google parent Alphabet Inc.: eradicating mosquito-borne diseases around the world.

A white high-top Mercedes van winds its way through the suburban sprawl and strip malls as a swarm of male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes shoot out of a black plastic tube on the passenger-side window. These pests are tiny and, with a wingspan of just a few millimeters, all but invisible.

“You hear that little beating sound?” says Kathleen Parkes, a spokesperson for Verily Life Sciences, a unit of Alphabet. She’s trailing the van in her car, the windows down. “Like a duh-duh-duh? That’s the release of the mosquitoes.”

Jacob Crawford, a Verily senior scientist riding with Parkes, begins describing a mosquito-control technique with dazzling potential. These particular vermin, he explains, were bred in the ultra-high-tech surroundings of Verily’s automated mosquito rearing system, 200 miles away in South San Francisco. They were infected with Wolbachia, a common bacterium. When those 80,000 lab-bred Wolbachia-infected, male mosquitoes mate with their counterpart females in the wild, the result is stealth annihilation: the offspring never hatch.Better make that 79,999. “One just hit the windshield,” says Crawford.

Mosquito-borne disease eradication is serious stuff for Alphabet, though it is just one of many of the company’s forays into health care and life sciences. Through Verily and other branches of the company, Alphabet is investigating smart contact lenses, artificial intelligence applications for health care, and the molecular mechanisms of aging. Just this month, Google hired Geisinger Health Chief Executive Officer David Feinberg to oversee its many health-care initiatives.

Verily guards its technology closely. But it stands to reason that if it succeeds in making mosquito control easy and cheap enough, it could have a lucrative offering on its hands: Many governments and businesses around the globe might be glad to pay for a solution to their mosquito problems.

Story continues

In the arid climate of California’s Central Valley, A. aegypti are detested for their vicious bite. But there, at least, they don’t typically transmit disease. Other places aren’t so lucky. The mosquito species is among the world’s deadliest, spreading diseases such as dengue fever and chikungunya in the tropics and subtropics. The diseases its bite carries kill tens of thousands of people every year and infect millions more. Releasing Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes into the wild may eventually wipe out entire populations of deadly mosquitoes and the diseases they carry.

At least that’s the plan if the field tests pan out in California. Every morning during mosquito season—which runs from April to November—the van, emblazoned with “Debug Fresno,” cruises through leafy housing tracks full of multistory homes. At predetermined locations, an algorithm automatically releases carefully calculated numbers of mosquitoes, counting each individual insect with the help of a laser as it exits the van.

As the efforts to wipe out mosquito-borne diseases have ramped up, a few different approaches to the problem have emerged. Bill Gates alone has pledged more than $1 billion for technologies that may help wipe out malaria, including controversial efforts to genetically modify mosquitoes. Verily’s approach relies on a variation of a very old strategy known as sterile insect technique, in which a population is gradually killed off by interfering with the ability to reproduce.

It’s unclear what would happen if the world’s disease-causing mosquitoes were done away with. The ecological role that mosquitoes play hasn’t been thoroughly studied, though some scientists suggest we might be just fine without them. But it’s clear that A. aegypti has no business in Fresno County. Native to warmer, wetter climes, no one knows where they came from when they first showed up in 2013. All that’s certain is that they have spread extremely rapidly.

“After we detected it, we did a massive and extensive effort to prevent the mosquito from establishing and eliminate it,” says Jodi Holeman, the scientific services director for Fresno County’s Consolidated Mosquito Abatement District. “We were not successful, in any way, shape, or form.”

The county went from having not much of a mosquito problem at all to having one that made residents avoid their backyards and porches. Unlike most mosquitoes, A. aegypti lives and breeds in places inhabited by people, laying its eggs in, say, the few droplets of stagnant water at the bottom of a wine glass left on a balcony, then hiding under beds and in closets, biting legs and ankles. This makes it much harder to fight. Going door-to-door and begging residents to dump out standing water wasn’t cutting it, so in 2016, Fresno teamed up with a scientist named Stephen Dobson and his company, MosquitoMate.

It was Dobson’s lab that figured out how to infect mosquitoes with a form of Wolbachia that’s different from the type of the bacteria that mosquitoes usually carry. That’s what makes the eggs unviable. MosquitoMate makes two species of mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia, A. aegypti and Aedes albopictus. Fresno became one of its test sites.

The initial Fresno trials were the first time male A. aegypti infected with the bacteria had ever been released in the U.S. The next year, Verily stepped in to help scale those efforts up, bringing more advanced technologies to the breeding and release process that would, they hoped, eventually make fighting mosquitoes massively scalable.

It seems to be working. This year, Verily signed on for a second season of releases. Two Verily trucks ply four different neighborhoods, hitting more than 3,000 homes. Over six months, the company released more than 15 million mosquitoes. Results from 2017 suggested the population of biting female mosquitoes dropped by two-thirds. This year, tweaks to the program have cut the mosquito population by a whopping 95 percent. A second project by Verily in Innisfail, Australia, that concluded in June reduced the mosquito population by 80 percent. This bodes well for eventually bringing the technology to other parts of the world—regions ravaged not just by itchy ankles but by deadly disease.

At first, Verily executives were worried about community resistance to fighting bugs with more bugs. So the company set up an outreach booth, complete with a cage full of male mosquitoes that people could stick their hands in to learn that males don’t bite. (Only female mosquitoes bite, which is why this and similar projects are careful to only release males.)

“We really appreciate you being here,” Clifford Lopes, a resident, told the company. “I brag to people about how I can sit on my porch now and not get bit.”

In videos of the original trials, you can see Holeman, the Fresno County scientist, gingerly blowing the mosquitoes out of a tube. The release van is now filled with proprietary technology, including software that determines exactly what areas of a neighborhood mosquitoes should be released in and a laser sensitive enough to count every single one as it exits, generating loads of data that can later be used to fine-tune the process.

At Verily’s headquarters, the “factory” where the mosquitoes are bred incorporates even more automation. Once the eggs are laid, robots rear the mosquitoes to adulthood, packaging them in containers filled with water and air, feeding them, and keeping them warm. Still other robots sort them by sex, first by size (females are bigger) and then optically, using proprietary technology. Mosquitoes are all given a digital identifier that makes it possible to follow them from egg state to the specific GPS coordinate where they’re released.

With this year’s season wrapping up, the company has yet to decide whether it will further expand the program next year. Verily wouldn’t say how much it costs to manufacture and release tens of thousands of mosquitoes every day, but it’s a safe bet that it’s still an expensive proposition.

“The key part is trying to be able to do a program like this in a very affordable and efficient way,” Crawford, the Verily scientist, says, “so that we can go to places where there isn’t a lot of money.”

Ohio school won't accept religion as an excuse not to vaccinate children amid measles and chickenpox outbreaks,Ohio school won't accept religion as an excuse not to vaccinate children amid measles and chickenpox outbreaks,0.0,"An Ohio school says that religion will no longer be supported as an excuse not to vaccinate child. (Photo: Norbert Millauer/AFP/Getty Images)

A school in Cleveland, Ohio, is no longer allowing religious beliefs to serve as an excuse for parents to not have their children vaccinated following measles outbreaks in New York and a chickenpox outbreak at a school in Asheville, N.C.

The measles outbreak is affecting an Orthodox Jewish community in New York City and has over 100 cases. Similarly, the area in which the chickenpox outbreak is occurring in North Carolina has a large number of religious vaccination exemptions.

“There’s really no good credible science for someone not to be vaccinated,” Dr. Baruch Fertel of the Cleveland Clinic told Toledo, Ohio, news station WTOL. “We see from these outbreaks that it can just spread like wildfire and cause harm.”

The Hebrew Academy of Cleveland sent a letter home to parents earlier this month stating that students were no longer exempt from vaccinations, even if the practice of vaccination went against their religious beliefs.

“We recognize that there are families that have strong views on both sides of this issue,” the letter from school leaders read. “However, this is not an area where we can accommodate any deviation from this new protocol.”

The letter goes on to state that the only exception to vaccinating a child would be if a physician certifies that vaccination is medically contraindicated — which is rare. “This is particularly important, as there are students in our school for whom it is medically unsafe to be vaccinated. Consequently, it is crucial that we ensure maximum vaccination rates across our student body.”

Depending on a student’s grade, the state of Ohio requires six vaccinations, which include polio, chickenpox and measles. The flu shot may be added in the future.

“Choosing not to vaccinate, yes it’s a personal decision, but on the other hand, it can affect other people if one becomes affected,” Dr. Fertel told the outlet, adding that some people choose not to vaccinate “because they may have read some medical literature that raised some questions,” but he assures parents that “that literature has really been discredited.”

Singaporean arrested after Porsche hits police officer in Krabi,Singaporean arrested after Porsche hits police officer in Krabi,0.0,"A Singaporean man has been arrested and charged with reckless driving causing injury after he hit a police officer at a speed checkpoint in Krabi on Thursday morning (Nov 29).

According to Thai newspaper The Nation, Simon Ong Chin Sim, 65, was speeding in his Porsche when he lost control of the car.

The car spun and its left wheel hit the Thai officer, Senior Sergeant Major Suriya Chumduang, while he was removing traffic cones at the speed checkpoint on Phetkasem Road in front of the 12th Forestry Resources Management Office in Krabi’s Muang district.

The officer suffered hip and leg injuries, and was treated at Krabi Hospital, according to Chinese daily Lianhe Wanbao.

The Nation reported that local authorities said five drivers in Porsches had travelled from Phuket and were speeding on the highway towards the checkpoint. The first driver tried to slow down when the convoy was passing through the speed checkpoint, and the other drivers behind were forced to brake suddenly.

The 65-year-old's car was the third of the Porsches and it is suspected that he had swerved left to avoid hitting the car in front of him. However, he ended up hitting the police officer as a result.

The group of Porsches are believed to be from the Porsche Club Singapore, and they were on an excursion in Thailand that began last Saturday (Nov 24).

According to local authorities, Phetkasem Road, one of the four major highways in Thailand, is where motorists are often caught for speeding.

A United States warship sailed through the Paracel Islands in the disputed South China Sea on Thursday after passing through the Taiwan Strait, in defiance of a protest from Beijing. The US Navy’s Seventh Fleet said the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Curtis Wilbur had conducted freedom of navigation operations in the vicinity of the Paracels, which are claimed by Beijing, Taiwan and Vietnam. “Unlawful and sweeping maritime claims in the South China Sea pose a serious threat to the freedom of the seas, including the freedoms of navigation and overflight, free trade and unimpeded commerce, and freedom of economic opportunity for South China Sea littoral nations,” it said in a statement.Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. It said Beijing, Taiwan and Vietnam had imposed unlawful restrictions on innocent passage over the disputed waters, and the operation was also aimed at challenging China’s territorial claims. “By conducting this operation, the United States demonstrated that these waters are beyond what China can lawfully claim as its territorial sea, and that China’s claimed straight baselines around the Paracel Islands are inconsistent with international law,” it said. “US forces operate in the South China Sea on a daily basis, as they have for more than a century. They routinely operate in close coordination with like-minded allies and partners who share our commitment to uphold a free and open international order that promotes security and prosperity.” China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Navy said the US had violated Chinese maritime sovereignty and it had expelled the vessel. “It has also seriously damaged peace and stability in the South China Sea,” a Southern Theatre Command spokesman said. “The US behaviour violates international law and basic norms of international relations, increases regional security risks, and is prone to misunderstandings, misjudgments and accidents at sea. It is unprofessional and irresponsible.” But the US said the destroyer had not been “expelled”. “The PLA’s statement is the latest in a long string of [Chinese] actions to misrepresent lawful US maritime operations and asserts its excessive and illegitimate maritime claims at the expense [of] Southeast Asian neighbours in the South China Sea,” it said. “[China’s] behaviour stands in contrast to the United States’ adherence to international law and our vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific region.” The US destroyer sailed through the South China Sea after passing through the Taiwan Strait on Tuesday, in what the US said was a demonstration of its commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific. China’s Eastern Theatre Command on Wednesday called the strait passage “a provocation”, saying it sent “wrong signals” to Taiwanese independence-leaning forces. While the warship transited the strait, US anti-submarine patrol and reconnaissance aircraft and a spy plane flew over the South China Sea, according to the Beijing-based South China Sea Strategic Situation Probing Initiative. South China Sea: the dispute that could start a military conflict The US has conducted three freedom of navigation operations (FONOPs) in the South China Sea this year, with two of them passing through the Paracels. It conducted 10 such operations over the disputed waters last year. Collin Koh, a research fellow with the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, said the US was “normalising” FONOPs, ensuring it will not elicit unwarranted reactions from the region. “Carrying out FONOPs is a long-standing thing since the 1970s, and comprises a diplomatic component as well as physical assertion,” he said. “Understandably, Washington would want such missions to be viewed as normal, principled and not specifically targeted for other political reasons.” Song Zhongping, a former PLA instructor, said it was normal for China to dispel the US vessel. “I don’t think it will necessarily lead to a misfire,” he said. “It has just become more normal.” Additional reporting by Kristin HuangMore from South China Morning Post:China’s navy in live-fire drills across three theatre commands, hinting at moves to counter USSouth China Sea heats up as Philippines drops the F-bomb over Chinese boatsSouth China Sea: Vietnam building up its maritime militia, magazine saysThis article US warship transits South China Sea to challenge ‘unlawful maritime claims’ first appeared on South China Morning PostFor the latest news from the South China Morning Post download our mobile app. Copyright 2021.",https://sg.news.yahoo.com/china-aids-group-really-regrets-role-gene-editing-095744065.html
Indonesia aviation in spotlight after Lion Air crash,Indonesia aviation in spotlight after Lion Air crash,0.0,"JAKARTA: Bumpy runways, hair-raising safety lapses, remote airstrips with no navigation systems and a dire shortage of experienced captains and maintenance crews.

Indonesia is one of the world's fastest-growing aviation markets, but it has come under fresh scrutiny since a fatal Lion Air crash last month as the sector struggles to keep up with its breakneck expansion, putting safety at risk, analysts warn.

""The vast increase in demand and operations has seen more regular accidents or events taking place that are preventable,"" said Stephen Wright, an aviation expert at the University of Leeds.

On Wednesday, investigators issued a preliminary report that said the doomed Lion Air jet had technical problems that the airline failed to fix before its final flight.

All 189 people on board were killed as the nearly new Boeing 737 slammed into the sea shortly after takeoff.

While officials did not lay blame or pinpoint a definitive cause of the Oct 29 accident, they said the budget carrier must take steps ""to improve (its) safety culture"".

Despite a spotty safety record and an avalanche of complaints over shoddy service, the carrier's parent Lion Air Group - which also operates five other airlines - has captured half the domestic market in less than 20 years of operation.

The group now has Southeast Asia's biggest fleet - more than 300 planes - with growth driven by a model built on cheap prices and flights to almost every corner of the vast Indonesian archipelago.

""WORST IN THE WORLD""

Indonesia's safety record has improved, analysts say, since its airlines including national carrier Garuda were banned for years from US and European airspace for safety violations.

Still, the country has recorded 40 fatal aviation accidents over the past 15 years.

The US and EU flight bans have been lifted in recent years, but the industry is still wrestling with outdated infrastructure, accusations of cutting corners and heavy restrictions on hiring pilots and technicians from overseas to plug staff gaps.

""If you want to grow quickly, you have to hire foreigners but here we have regulations which prevent us from easily hiring them,"" said Jakarta-based aviation analyst Gerry Soejatman.

Lion Air - which captured headlines in 2011 with a then-record US$22-billion order for Boeing planes - sits at the centre of a US$4-billion-plus sector with double-digit annual growth and 97 million domestic travellers last year alone.

The carrier's chief, Edward Sirait, acknowledged that people may see Lion as a ""tacky company"" that hires ""grumpy"" service staff straight out of high school.

But he disputed any suggestion that pilots - including those that fly on international routes - are not properly trained.

""They'd never be able to fly abroad if they weren't qualified,"" he told AFP.

Indonesia's transport ministry said it is pushing Lion and other airlines for safety and service improvements.

Some Indonesian lawmakers, however, want the budget carrier's licence to be revoked, a call that may be bolstered by Wednesday's report.

Such punishment is unlikely given the size of the Lion Air Group, a major employer that has ballooned as Indonesia's growing economy and rising incomes have given more of its 260 million people access to air travel.

Its co-founder Rusdi Kirana - who described his own airline as the ""worst in the world"" in a 2015 interview - is a close confidante of President Joko Widodo, who appointed him to the key post of Indonesia's ambassador to neighbouring Malaysia.

And the firm's growth strategy is crucial to Widodo's infrastructure push, which includes plans for dozens of new airports including a US$10-billion hub in the capital, as he seeks re-election next year.

Lion Air is also the only carrier to service many remote parts of a 17,000-island country, where some of the more than 200 airports don't even have proper navigation equipment.

That means pilots have been forced to use their sight alone while landing over perilous terrain and on less-than-smooth runways.

""There are still many runways with uneven surfaces so when the plane lands its feels like you're driving on a potholed road,"" said Lion Air captain Yusni Maryan.

""NO CLUE""

As a frequent flyer, Indonesian civil servant Amalia Pissano has her share of horror stories, from the Lion Air captain who delayed a flight for two hours so he could have a meal to a terrifying experience aboard a Sriwijaya Air flight on the same route as the crashed Lion jet.

The plane suddenly began shaking violently before it plunged toward the ground, sparking chaos inside the cabin until pilots regained control and landed safely, she said.

The crew never offered an explanation, Pissano said.

""It was really scary because the plane was rocking and the crew seemed to have no clue what was happening.""",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/indonesia-aviation-in-spotlight-after-lion-air-crash-10980054
How EU arms found their way into one of Africa's bloodiest conflicts,How EU arms found their way into one of Africa's bloodiest conflicts,0.0,"In July 2014, as the death toll from civil war in the world’s newest nation mounted, the European Union announced a tough new line against those it accused of failing to halt the fighting.

With a ceasefire arrangement in tatters and thousands dead, the EU said it would impose sanctions on military leaders it accused of obstructing South Sudan’s peace process and overseeing atrocities.

EU leaders said the measures were “part of wider EU efforts to stop violence and avoid further instability in the region” and designed to strengthen a long-standing arms embargo.

Yet only four days later, at a little after 10am on July 14, a Boeing 747 taxied towards the runway at Burgas on Bulgaria’s Black Sea Coast and took to the sky. On board the cargo plane bound for Entebbe in Uganda were 4,000 assault rifles and close to three million rounds of ammunition.

The back half of the taxi was completely crushed and part of the front of the coach sheared off following the crash on the island of Tsing Yi, images in local media showed. The taxi driver and two men and two women coach passengers were killed in the accident, police said.

Local media reports described the bus as a ""tourist coach"" but said it had been carrying workers to the airport at the time of the crash, which happened near the exit of a tunnel. Tsing Yi is connected by a freeway to Hong Kong International Airport on neighbouring Lantau island.

Television footage showed the injured being treated by the side of the road before they were taken to four hospitals. The South China Morning Post reported that several of the injured were in serious condition.

One coach passenger said the bus had been travelling fast and had crashed into a stationary taxi with its hazard lights on at the side of the road, according to SCMP. ""It seemed to me that the coach did not slow down. I fell onto the floor (when it crashed),"" the passenger said.

A passenger told local television channel TVB the scene on the bus was ""very chaotic, we were crushed together"". The coach seemed to have collided repeatedly with the kerb before coming to a stop, another passenger told the channel.

""The bus hit once, then hit left and right, and hit the roadside to stop,"" the passenger said. Television footage showed the kerb on either side of the road was damaged.

The back half of the taxi was completely crushed and both sides of the bus were damaged with traces of blood on the outside following the crash on the island of Tsing Yi.

Police said the collision happened on the left lane of the main road. The taxi had stopped with its hazard lights on and the coach ploughed into it.

""We believe the taxi was broken down and stopped in the left lane of the road. Around 40 seconds later, a coach hit it from behind,"" Supt. Yip Siu-ming said.

The coach then lost control, Yip added, hitting the right hand side crash barrier and then the left one, and throwing three passengers out. The 62-year-old driver was also hurled from the vehicle and injured.

The taxi driver, two male and two female coach passengers were killed, according to police.

Hong Kong's hospital authority said one person remained critical and another was in serious condition.

The rest of the injured were either stable or had been released from hospital.

Debris including glass and personal belongings were strewn across the main road, which remained closed early Friday.

Hong Kong carrier Cathay Pacific confirmed ""a shuttle bus carrying our employees was involved in a traffic accident this morning.""

""It is a tragic and very sad incident. We extend our deepest condolences to the families of those who have sadly passed away,"" the airline said.

The company later confirmed two fatalities were from its staff. Those involved in the crash came from its airport, catering and ground handling operations it said.

""This is a difficult time for our community and we will do all we can to support everyone affected by this accident,"" Cathay Pacific CEO Rupert Hogg said in a statement.

'Crushed together'

Yip said police would look into whether the coach driver, who had been working for 10 hours at the time of the accident, was tired or affected by alcohol.

""From what we can see, it's obvious that the driver did not see the broken-down taxi on the road and hit it from behind,"" Yip said, adding that his working hours were from 7:00 pm to 7:00 am.

The Kwoon Chung bus company told reporters that the driver had been working for them for 12 years and had not declared any health problems.

Matthew Wong, chairman of the company, told reporters that the driver had had enough rest and had taken eight days off in November.

Within his working day, the driver would have been on the road for six to seven hours, Wong added.

Tsing Yi is connected by a freeway to Hong Kong International Airport which is located on neighboring Lantau island.

Earliest UK estimates of children affected in the womb by alcohol intake during pregnancy,Earliest UK estimates of children affected in the womb by alcohol intake during pregnancy,0.0,"A report published on 30 November 2018 in Preventive Medicine reveals that a stunning 17 percent of children could possibly be affected by alcohol exposure during their intrauterine life. This refers to a group of lifelong conditions caused by prenatal drinking, called fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD).

Drinking during pregnancy is extremely common in the UK, which ranks fourth in the world in this respect. However, there are no population-based studies to provide an approximation of the number of people with FASD.

FASD is often classified as a relatively invisible and underdiagnosed disability, due to the lack of overt physical symptoms and signs. There is only one clinic that deals with this specialty directly in England.

To address this need, a team from the University of Bristol and Cardiff University used a screening tool to gather a wide range of information on maternal alcohol intake during pregnancy. In collaboration with medical professionals, the research covered 13,495 children whose development had been followed in the Bristol's Children of the 90s study.

The results were astonishing, showing alcohol exposure in up to 79 percent of children in the study, while a positive screen was obtained for FASD symptoms in up to 17 percent. The screen was defined to be positive if the child had problems with learning or behavior in at least three different areas, either with or without physical features such as growth deficiency and a distinctive facies marked by a smooth philtrum, a thin upper lip and small eye openings.

While the positive screening results for FASD were rightly distinguished from a diagnosis of the condition, the study outcome was disturbing in terms of the very high rate of drinking in pregnancy and the high prevalence of symptoms suggestive of FASD that it showed. This may indicate that FASD is probably a significant public health burden in the UK.

The ability to arrive at an approximate FASD prevalence is important since without such information, few people are likely to be aware of the condition. This would result in the condition going undiagnosed or being diagnosed late in children, adolescents and adults. As a result, they would be deprived of necessary support.

The researchers point out that the information they used is several years old. Meanwhile, the current medical opinion on the safety of drinking during pregnancy has officially changed. However, the rates of fetal alcohol exposure within the UK are still high, with recent information suggesting that 75 percent of women do drink while they are pregnant. A third of these women binge on alcohol. This could indicate that many people are currently experiencing FASD symptoms.

The most up-to-date guidance states that the safest approach is not to drink alcohol at all if you are pregnant, or if you think you may become pregnant. It is important that people are aware of the risks so that they can make an informed decision about drinking in pregnancy.” Dr Cheryl McQuire, the leader of the study, who is a researcher in epidemiology and alcohol-related outcomes at the University of Bristol.

Moreover, she says, the study points to the need for future research to clearly identify how many people in the UK have FASD today.

Countries such as Canada, the US and Italy have made use of in-school screening measures to arrive at a prevalence of up to 10 percent among children, going up to a disturbing 30 percent when it comes to children who are being given care.

Another researcher, Dr Raja Mukherjee, who heads an FASD diagnostic clinic at Surrey and Boarders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, pointed out that the current study shows an apparent mismatch between the findings and the rarity of the condition as reported by most clinicians. The research reveals that many people suffering with this condition are probably going undiagnosed in the general population.

It shows that it is a disorder that is seemingly hidden in plain sight that we need to pay attention to. Unless we start looking for it we will continue to miss it. If we fail to diagnose it then those affected individuals will continue to be affected by a lack of support… These results can be the first step in helping us in the UK to realise it is no longer a condition we can ignore.” Dr Mukherjee

Sandra Butcher, Chief Executive of the NO-FAS UK, underlined the wide scope of the screening, saying that it “shines light on a staggeringly widespread and largely avoidable public health crisis.”

She states that the only way to go from here, for anyone in a position to influence or make public health policy and who cares about protecting those in society who are at most risk, both mentally and physically, is to put in place a complete training and action program which covers the prevention, diagnosis and support of FASD. Such support will be required lifelong, because FASD is an incurable condition, and requires increasing levels of support as affected children grow into adulthood and beyond.

The most current medical advice on drinking in pregnancy, from the Chief Medical Officer, in January 2016, states that for women who are pregnant or think they could become pregnant, it is safest to abstain from all alcohol to minimize the risk of fetal alcohol exposure. However, if small amounts of alcohol were ingested before pregnancy was detected or even during pregnancy, the risk of any toxicity is low, according to the guideline.

According to this advice, if a pregnant woman has drunk alcohol before knowing that she was pregnant, further drinking is to be avoided. It is safe to say that the baby will not be affected in the majority of these cases. The guideline goes on to suggest talking to a healthcare provider if a woman is concerned about using alcohol in pregnancy.",https://www.news-medical.net/news/20181130/Earliest-UK-estimates-of-children-affected-in-the-womb-by-alcohol-intake-during-pregnancy.aspx
"AIDS treatment has progressed, but without a vaccine, suffering still abounds","AIDS treatment has progressed, but without a vaccine, suffering still abounds",0.0,"I mentioned to a friend, a gay man nearing 60, that World AIDS Day, which has been observed on Dec. 1 since 1988, was almost upon us. He had no idea that World AIDS Day still exists.

This lack of knowledge is a testament to the great accomplishments that have occurred since World AIDS Day was created 30 years ago. It is also due to an accident in the timing of his birth that my friend escaped the devastation wreaked by AIDS among gay men in the U.S., before there was antiretroviral therapy.

Many people have forgotten AIDS, but there are consequences to forgetting. The fight against AIDS is at a tipping point. Increasingly, there are signs that we may be heading in the wrong direction.

Many successes, yet the grand prize is elusive

I am a social epidemiologist with more than 20 years of research experience in HIV and STD prevention. I am also the founder of The Basics with Dr. Mo, a sex health communications project that translates prevention science directly for people who need it most.

It is true that global HIV/AIDS success stories abound: Mother-to-child transmission can be reduced to below 5 percent, 75 percent of people living with HIV know their status and 59 percent receive antiretroviral therapy.

Most recently, Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) – the use of antiretrovial drugs to prevent HIV infection among those exposed – has proved to be a successful prevention approach.

Yet the prize – a vaccine that can prevent HIV infection – remains elusive, and makes impossible the use of the only known strategy to have ever eradicated an infectious disease: widespread vaccination. That disease was smallpox, in 1980.

The seeds of unease

Despite the lack of a vaccine, in 2016 United Nations member states adopted a political declaration on ending the AIDS epidemic by 2030.

As part of the accountability framework, interim 2020 goals set a target of 500,000 new HIV infections for that year. A review of the most recent data estimated 1.8 million new HIV infections in 2017, exactly the same number as in 2016.

Prominent scientists have already begun to question the ability to eradicate AIDS by the 2030 deadline, and concede that the situation has stagnated. The attainment of eradication looks bleak, without the aid of either an effective vaccine or the immediate large-scale promotion and utilization of existing prevention tools (i.e., condoms, voluntary circumcision and potentially PrEP). Given that the vast majority of new HIV infections are sexually transmitted and that condoms have played a decisive role in the global control of HIV transmission, ongoing condom availability and use will be essential to future eradication.

Condoms – both male and female – remain a highly effective mechanism of HIV/AIDS prevention, as well as of other sexually transmitted infections that greatly enhance the risk of HIV transmission.

Condom use is also strongly advised by global public health institutions, including the World Health Organization and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in conjunction will all other HIV prevention tools including PrEP, because of their lower levels of effectiveness in preventing transmission.

Condom availability is a different matter and varies greatly from country to country. Countries with the highest levels of HIV often rely heavily on donor support. According to the most recent data, in sub-Saharan Africa in 2013, only 10 condoms were available annually for every man aged 15 to 64 (as compared with the recommended 50 to 60), and, on average, there was one female condom available for every eight women. Funding required to maintain – let alone scale up – HIV commitments, particularly those dedicated to prevention, are increasingly uncertain.

The hydra, sprouting new heads

Even though condoms are an extremely effective barrier method, it is usage that makes condoms efficacious in preventing HIV transmission. Reported condom use varies considerably around the world, and ranges from 80 percent use by men in Namibia and Cambodia to less than 40 percent usage by men and women in other countries, including some highly affected by HIV such as Sierra Leone and Mozambique.

Age plays a role, too. Among young people aged 15 to 24, condom use at last sex varies from more than 80 percent in some Latin American and European countries to less than 30 percent in some West African countries. In the U.S., condom use is at the lower end of the spectrum: Only one-third of the population uses condoms, a number that has not changed significantly over the past two decades.

The majority – 66 percent – of the world’s HIV/AIDS cases are in sub-Saharan Africa, where there has been much progress, particularly with the provision of antiretroviral therapy.

However, there are worrying signs in other parts of the world. There has been little change in new HIV infections in countries outside of sub-Saharan Africa between 1990 and 2017.

In fact, six of the 10 most populous countries in the world have experienced 10 percent to 45 percent increases in new HIV infections since 2010: Russia, China, Brazil, Pakistan, Mexico and Bangladesh. Even in countries such as the U.S., where new HIV infections have decreased by 8 percent overall, the rates of change are unevenly distributed. For example, young African-American men who have sex with men show no decrease in new infections; African-American gay and bisexual men represent the largest percentage of new HIV infections: more than one-quarter.

The increased provision of antiretroviral therapy to people living with AIDS has had a huge impact on extending life and in preventing new HIV infections. However, there remains 25 percent of the population who live with HIV, about 9 million people, who do not know their status.

While we have been necessarily focused on the head of the hydra in sub-Saharan Africa, other hydra heads are beginning to make their presence known, many in countries ill-prepared to deal with increases in the number of new HIV infections.

In the absence of a vaccine, behavior change in the form of condom use promotion, acceptance and adoption, at a scale that many gay men utilized during the peak of the AIDS epidemic in the industrialized world, will need to occur. There are many challenges: continued stigma and gender inequality, not to mention issues of availability, distribution and proactive, nonjudgmental promotion.

We must not forget. Progress on reducing the rate of new HIV infection has been done before. It can be done again, but only if we take forceful, funded action now.",http://theconversation.com/aids-treatment-has-progressed-but-without-a-vaccine-suffering-still-abounds-107765
"Powerful quakes buckle Alaska roads, briefly trigger tsunami warning","Powerful quakes buckle Alaska roads, briefly trigger tsunami warning",0.0,"Back-to-back earthquakes measuring 7.0 and 5.7 shattered highways and rocked buildings Friday in Anchorage and the surrounding area, sending people running into the streets and briefly triggering a tsunami warning for islands and coastal areas south of the city.

No tsunami arrived, and there were no immediate reports of deaths or serious injuries.

The U.S. Geological Survey said the first and more powerful quake was centred about 12 kilometres north of Anchorage, Alaska's largest city, with a population of about 300,000. People ran from their offices or took cover under desks. The 5.7 aftershock arrived within minutes, followed by a series of smaller quakes.

Items from shelves that came unbolted from a wall are strewn across Anchorage True Value Hardware's stockroom floor. Store owner Tim Craig said no one was injured in the store but hundreds of shelf items hit the floor. He said off-duty staffers as well as customers offered to help clean up. (Dan Joling/Associated Press)

""We just hung onto each other. You couldn't even stand,"" said Sheila Bailey, who was working at a high school cafeteria in Palmer when the quake struck. ""It sounded and felt like the school was breaking apart.""

A large section of an off-ramp near the Anchorage airport collapsed, marooning a car on a narrow island of pavement surrounded by deep chasms in the concrete. Several cars crashed at a major intersection in Wasilla, north of Anchorage, during the shaking.

Anchorage Police Chief Justin Doll said he had been told that parts of Glenn Highway, a scenic route that runs northeast out of the city past farms, mountains and glaciers, had ""completely disappeared."" Traffic in the three lanes heading out of the city was bumper-to-bumper and all but stopped Friday afternoon as emergency vehicles passed on the shoulder.

The quake broke store windows, knocked items off shelves, opened cracks in a two-storey building downtown, disrupted electrical service and disabled traffic lights, snarling traffic. It also threw a full-grown man out of his bathtub.

The U.S. Geological Survey said the first and more powerful quake was centred about 12 kilometres north of Anchorage, Alaska's largest city, with a population of about 300,000.

Flights at the airport were suspended for hours after the quake knocked out telephones and forced the evacuation of the control tower. And the 1,287-kilometre Alaska oil pipeline was shut down while crews were sent to inspect it for damage.

Anchorage's school system cancelled classes and asked parents to pick up their children while it examined buildings for gas leaks or other damage.

Fifteen-year-old Sadie Blake and other members of the Homer High School wrestling team were at an Anchorage school gymnasium waiting for a tournament to start when the bleachers started rocking ""like crazy"" and the lights went out.

Ceiling is falling down <a href=""https://t.co/ZPY6fhEPrp"">pic.twitter.com/ZPY6fhEPrp</a> —@Chase_AK

People started running down the bleachers in the dark, trying to get out.

""It was a gym full of screams,"" said team chaperone Ginny Grimes.

When it was over, Sadie said, there was only one thing she could do: ""I started crying.""

Jonathan Lettow was waiting with his five-year-old daughter and other children for a school bus near their home in Wasilla when the quake struck. The children got on the ground while Lettow tried to keep them calm.

""It's one of those things where in your head you think, 'OK, it's going to stop,' and you say that to yourself so many times in your head that finally you think, 'OK, maybe this isn't going to stop,""' he said.

Soon after the shaking ended, the school bus pulled up and the children boarded, but the driver stopped at a bridge and refused to go across because of deep cracks in the road, Lettow said.

Former Alaska governor Sarah Palin tweeted that her home was damaged: ""Our family is intact — house is not. I imagine that's the case for many, many others."" She posted a video of the inside of her parents' home, with broken dishes littering the kitchen floor. A large set of antlers appeared to have fallen off a wall of the living room.

🙏🏼 for Alaska. Our family is intact - house is not... I imagine that’s the case for many, many others. So thankful to be safe; praying for our state following the earthquake. —@SarahPalinUSA

Gov. Bill Walker issued a disaster declaration. He was in an elevator in a high-rise Anchorage office building and said it was a ""rough ride"" coming down. He described the quake as a 7.2, though it was unclear why his figure differed from that of the USGS.

Thrown from bathtub

In Kenai, southwest of Anchorage, Brandon Slaton was home alone and soaking in his bathtub when the earthquake struck. Slaton, who weighs 209 pounds, said it created a powerful back-and-forth sloshing that threw him out of the tub.

His 120-pound mastiff panicked and tried to run down the stairs, but the house was swaying so much that the dog was thrown into a wall and tumbled down the stairs, Slaton said.

Slaton ran into his son's room after the shaking stopped. The boy's fish was on the floor, gasping, its tank shattered. Slaton put the fish in a bowl.

""It was anarchy,"" he said. ""There's no pictures left on the walls, there's no power, there's no fish tank left. Everything that's not tied down is broke.""

Alaska was the site of the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in the U.S. The 9.2-magnitude quake on March 27, 1964, was centred about 120 kilometres east of Anchorage. It and the tsunami it triggered claimed about 130 lives.

The state averages 40,000 earthquakes a year, with more large quakes than the 49 other states combined. Southern Alaska has a high risk of earthquakes because the Earth's plates slide past each other under the region.

Alaska has been hit by a number of powerful quakes over 7.0 in recent decades, including a 7.9 last January southeast of Kodiak Island. But it is rare for a quake this big to strike so close to such a heavily populated area.

David Harper was getting some coffee at a store when the low rumble began and intensified into something that sounded ""like the building was just going to fall apart."" He ran for the exit with other patrons.

"Ukraine closes border to Russian men of combat age, citing invasion fears","Ukraine closes border to Russian men of combat age, citing invasion fears",0.0,"Ukrainian officials on Friday upped the ante in the growing confrontation with Russia, announcing a travel ban for most Russian males and searching the home of an influential cleric of the Russian Orthodox Church.

Petro Tsygykal, chief of the Ukrainian Border Guard Service, announced at a security meeting on Friday that Russian males between 16 and 60 will be barred from travelling to the country while martial law is in place.

Ukraine's president, Petro Poroshenko, told the meeting that the measures were taken ""in order to prevent the Russian Federation from forming private armies"" on Ukrainian soil.

The long-simmering conflict bubbled over Sunday when Russian border guards rammed into and opened fire on three Ukrainian vessels near the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow annexed in 2014.

The vessels were trying to pass through the Kerch Strait on their way to the Sea of Azov. The Russians then captured the ships and their 24-member crew.

The Ukrainian parliament on Monday also adopted a motion from Poroshenko to impose martial law in the country for 30 days in the wake of the standoff.

There has been growing hostility between Ukraine and Russia since Moscow's annexation of the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in 2014. Russia has also supported separatists in Ukraine's east with clandestine dispatches of troops and weapons. Fighting there has killed at least 10,000 people since 2014 but eased somewhat after a 2015 truce.

Friday's announcement follows Thursday's decision by U.S. President Donald Trump to scrap his much-anticipated meeting with Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Trump said it wasn't appropriate for him to meet with Putin since Russia hasn't released the Ukrainian seamen.

""We don't like what happened. We're not happy about it. Nobody is. But hopefully they'll be able to settle it out soon because we look forward to meeting with President Putin,"" Trump said in Buenos Aires on Friday.

""But on the basis of what took place, with respect to the ships and sailors — that was the sole reason.""

Donald Tusk, the European Council's president, said Friday the EU is expected to extend sanctions on Russia, calling the Ukrainian ships' seizure ""totally unnacceptable.""

""Europe is united in its support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity,"" Tusk told reporters on the sidelines of this weekend's G20 summit in Argentina.

Senior cleric under investigation

Meanwhile, Ukraine's intelligence agency announced on Friday that it is investigating a senior cleric of the Russian Orthodox Church.

Ihor Guskov, chief of staff of the SBU intelligence agency, told reporters that its officers are searching the home of Rev. Pavlo, who leads the Pechersk monastery in Kyiv. He said the cleric is suspected of ""inciting hatred.""

The monastery, which is the spiritual centre of Ukraine, is under the jurisdiction of the Russian Orthodox Church.

The Ukrainian church, which has been part of the Russian Orthodox Church for centuries, has moved closer to forming an independent church — fuelled by conflict with Russia Ukraine's Orthodox communities earlier this year.

There are three Orthodox communities in Ukraine, including two breakaway churches. Ukrainian authorities have sought to portray Russian Orthodox clerics in Ukraine as supporting separatists.

Ukraine's president announced on Thursday that the Constantinople patriarchy has approved a decree granting the Ukrainian Orthodox Church independence from the Russian Orthodox Church, a major boost to the president's approval ratings.

Russian ships fired Sunday on three Ukrainian vessels attempting to pass through a strait that Russia has effectively controlled since it annexed Crimea in 2014. Since then, a freighter ship has blocked the only entrance in and out of the waterway. (CBC)

Both the Russian Orthodox Church and Russian authorities are strongly against the move, and have warned Ukraine not to do it, fearing sectarian violence.

Russia's government-appointed ombudsman for Crimea told Russian news agencies that all the captured seamen have been transported from a detention centre in Crimea.

Russian TV station Dozhd on Friday quoted Kogershyn Sagiyeva, a member of the Moscow oversight council that is allowed to inspect prisons, as saying that 21 seamen have been transferred to the Moscow Lefortovo jail while three other seamen are in a hospital in another jail. She said she met with some of the seamen and they appeared to be in good shape.

OPEC could make Canadian oil price crisis even worse,OPEC could make Canadian oil price crisis even worse,0.0,"The oil price crisis in Western Canada could deepen next week depending on whether Saudi Arabia, Russia and other countries decide to cut oil production and — if so — by how much.

Oil prices in Alberta are the lowest they have been in more than a decade, selling for about $17 US per barrel for Western Canada Select, the Alberta benchmark for heavy oil. Around the globe, prices have also suffered with West Texas Intermediate, the North American benchmark, falling about 33 per cent in the last two months.

What OPEC decides could give prices a boost or send them spiralling down further.

The oil industry's rough ride in October and November has created an immense amount of interest in the OPEC meeting in Vienna on Dec. 6.

""It has a huge impact,"" says Jackie Forrest, analyst with the ARC Energy Research Institute in Calgary, about the possible fallout for Canadian oil prices.

""If OPEC doesn't make a cut and if global prices begin to fall, that will just push our prices down further, putting more pressure on Canadian producers. It's very consequential to the Canadian industry.""

The oilpatch was enjoying climbing prices throughout the summer as supply and demand were in balance, but surprising many experts, production kept on climbing — mainly in the U.S. — and storage tanks are filling up.

The meeting is 'very consequential to the Canadian industry,' says Jackie Forrest of the ARC Energy Research Institute. (Kyle Bakx/CBC)

Other factors have also caused a drop in oil prices such as the U.S. loosening its restrictions on Iran and concerns about limited oil demand growth in 2019.

Oil prices in Western Canada are especially low because of a backlog of oil and limited spare export space in pipelines and on railways.

OPEC meetings are tough to predict and experts don't seem to have a sense which direction the cartel will go next week. In the past, OPEC countries have announced production cuts, but global oil prices still tumbled.

""There is always downside risk with these meetings because the market has some sort of expectation. Even if there is a cut made, if it is not what the market was expecting, then sometimes its negative in terms of where prices move,"" says Forrest.

OPEC countries may decide not to cut production for several reasons because many countries can't afford to turn down the taps.

""The question is, who will do the cutting? That's always the question,"" says Derek Brower, a London-based analyst with the RS Energy Group.

""The pool of people who can actually cut is pretty small. That's why the credibility of this deal really hinges on what Russia and Saudi Arabia do.""

Brower says he doesn't get the feeling there is a sense of urgency to make production cuts from OPEC leaders. Prices just haven't fallen far enough.

""When it comes to cuts for OPEC, as the saying goes, it's a bit like a bag of tea,"" he says. ""It only really works when it's in hot water. The water is getting pretty warm right now in terms of the oil price.""

At this point, Brower estimates that OPEC and non-OPEC countries will agree to cut production between 500,000 and one million barrels of oil per day, but that the market will view this as underwhelming.

Some experts are optimistic the cartel will do enough to give oil prices a boost.

Analysts with BMO Capital Markets expect the cartel will cut production to raise prices moderately.

WTI prices are currently about $51 dollars per barrel, but according to a recent research note, BMO analysts now project WTI to ""rise from its current level to an average of $62 US per barrel in 2019.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/opec-wti-wcs-alberta-1.4908924
U.S. help urged near Ebola outbreak epicentre but security questions remain,U.S. help urged near Ebola outbreak epicentre but security questions remain,0.0,"Global health experts are urging the Trump administration to allow U.S. government disease specialists — ""some of the world's most experienced"" — to return to northeastern Congo to help fight the second largest Ebola outbreak in history.

The U.S. experts have been sidelined for weeks, ordered away from the region because of State Department security concerns. New statements in two top medical journals this week are calling on the U.S. to change its mind and send them back where they are sorely needed.

This Ebola outbreak is like no other, as health workers compare the region to a war zone. Dozens of armed rebel groups are active, and their deadly attacks have forced responders to pause crucial containment work for days. Many new cases have been unrelated to known infections, alarming evidence that gaps in tracking remain.

Late Thursday, officials declared this outbreak second only to the devastating West Africa one that killed more than 11,000 from 2014-2016. Congo's Health Ministry said the number of confirmed and probable cases has reached 426, edging past the Uganda outbreak in 2000. So far this outbreak has 198 confirmed deaths and 47 probable ones.

""It is in U.S. national interests to control outbreaks before they escalate into a crisis,"" one group of global health experts said in the Journal of the American Medical Association. A separate statement in the New England Journal of Medicine said : ""Given the worsening of the outbreak, we believe it's essential that these security concerns be addressed and that CDC staff return to the field.""

It is not clear how many U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention workers are now forced to tackle the outbreak from Congo's capital, Kinshasa, nearly 1,600 kilometres away.

A State Department official said CDC experts — and those with the U.S. Agency for International Development, also affected by the order — continue to work closely with international partners to stop the outbreak.

Months at least before outbreak is contained

Security concerns are real, Ebola responders say. Teams with the World Health Organization and Congo's Health Ministry venture out on virus containment missions accompanied by UN peacekeepers or other armed security in areas where gunfire echoes daily.

Given the complications, this outbreak will last at least another six months before it can be contained, Dr. Peter Salama, WHO's emergencies chief, has predicted.

Despite the challenges, Ebola responders have made breakthroughs that have given new hope in the fight against one of the world's most notorious diseases. More than 37,000 people have received Ebola vaccinations, and Congo has begun the first-ever trial to test the effectiveness and safety of four experimental Ebola drugs.

Speaking to The Associated Press on Friday from the outbreak zone, the Ebola response program director for the International Rescue Committee, Dr. Stacey Mearns, said the absence of the CDC's experts can be felt acutely. Her colleague, Dr. Mesfin Teklu Tessema, the IRC's senior health director, was among the more than two dozen people who signed the statement published in JAMA on Thursday.

""If the [U.S.] ban were not in place the CDC would have a big and growing presence here,"" said Mearns, who worked closely with the CDC in the West Africa outbreak. The U.S. sent thousands of responders to West Africa from the CDC and other parts of government, including the military.

The CDC's experts have rich experience in surveillance, treatment and lab testing, Mearns said, adding that some of that work is now being done from afar.

""We haven't seen the height of this outbreak,"" she warned as Ebola continues to move into new areas in Congo, worrying close to a heavily traveled border with Uganda. ""If want to see the end of this, we do need all critical actors on the ground.""",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/cdc-congo-ebola-1.4927162
Mount Cook avalanche: NSW police office dies in NZ tragedy,Mount Cook avalanche: NSW police office dies in NZ tragedy,0.0,"An off-duty 40-year-old senior police constable has been killed in an avalanche on New Zealand’s Mount Cook.

A New South Wales policeman has been killed in an avalanche while hiking in New Zealand.

He is understood to be the second NSW police officer to die in the country’s South Island this year.

The off-duty 40-year-old officer was buried after he and a companion are thought to have triggered a small avalanche while climbing down the Eugenie Glacier at Mount Cook National Park on Thursday, police say.

While he has not been named publicly by New Zealand authorities, NSW Police say he was a leading senior constable with the Blue Mountains Police Area Command.

“NSW Police have offered support and condolences to the officers wife and family,” a spokesperson said.

The hiking pair had turned back due to poor weather when the 20-metre wave travelled 300 metres and pushed them into a crevasse.

The second man, left with minor injuries, was unable to get to his friend in time, New Zealand police inspector Dave Gaskin told media.

He was later winched out by helicopter after setting off a locator beacon.

A third member of their party had been unwell in the morning and stayed behind in a hut. He and the injured hiker were later flown off the mountain. Inspector Gaskin described the climbers as reasonably proficient and experienced.

An advisory on Thursday morning warned of a moderate avalanche risk above 1200m, due to unstable snow and poor weather in the days prior, a Mountain Safety Council spokesman said.

“(It’s) an inherently dangerous place to go,” the spokesman said.

An update later in the afternoon warned there was considerable risk from dangerous avalanche conditions in the area and said “cautious route-finding and conservative decision-making” were essential.

Rain had aggravated the risks in an already unforgiving environment, the Department of Conservation said.

“The snow at Eugenie Glacier was loose and slushy as warmer temperatures meant the snow hadn’t frozen for several nights,” said the department’s Mount Cook operations manager, Brent Swanson.

Thursday’s event was the second deadly avalanche at the national park in recent weeks.

Last month, on nearby Mount Hicks, New Zealand adventurer Jo Morgan managed to dig her way out of the snow that killed her two companions, Martin Hess and Wolfgang Maier.

'Deeply shameful': 258 runners caught cheating in Shenzhen's half marathon,'Deeply shameful': 258 runners caught cheating in Shenzhen's half marathon,0.0,"Organisers of the Shenzhen half-marathon have said the 258 participants caught cheating during Sunday’s race will not be able to run away from punishment for their actions.

As many as 18 runners were found to wearing fake bibs, and three were running on behalf of others. They face lifetime bans from the event, the Chinese Xinhua news agency reported.

The 237 others, most of whom had taken shortcuts during the race and were caught out by traffic cameras and local photographers, could be banned for two years.

In the most blatant case, a traffic camera caught runners turning round at least 1km before they were supposed to make a U-turn, potentially shaving about 10% off the 21km race.

Footage shows runners crossing through bushes and trees that separated two parts of the course.

Shenzhen half marathon footage shows participants taking shortcuts.

Xinhua quoted organisers as saying: “We deeply regret the violations that occurred during the event. Marathon running is not simply exercise, it is a metaphor for life, and every runner is responsible for him or herself.”

Hardly masking its disgust at the widespread cheating, Xinhua branded it “deeply shameful” and added: “No matter the participants or the organisers, they should reflect: What is the significance of participating in and holding marathons?

“Don’t run and forget why you run. Don’t let the marathon turn sour.”

Participants in the Shenzhen marathon, just over the border from Hong Kong, were required to enrol with valid credentials, such as ID cards, residence permits, passports or military ID.

Other marathon events in China are reported to have started using facial recognition technology to track runners.

Competitors in other marathons are now kitted out with electronic chips that register runners’ progress as they pass over timing mats installed around the course. This provides more accurate times – but it also gives organisers, and anyone who cares to look, a wealth of data to examine for suspicious results.

Marathon and leisure running is growing fast in China despite the pollution which often blankets major cities, with participants donning the latest fashionable gear and wearable technology.

In 2011 there were just 22 marathons, half-marathons or other running events in China, according to the Chinese Athletics Association. However, that figure has skyrocketed to nearly 1,100 this year.",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/30/deeply-shameful-258-runners-caught-cheating-in-shenzhens-half-marathon
Four in ten Australians think women lie about being victims of sexual assault,Four in ten Australians think women lie about being victims of sexual assault,0.0,"Four in ten Australians (42%) think sexual assault accusations are a way of getting back at men, according to the fourth National Community Attitudes Survey (NCAS) on violence against women, released today.

Almost the same proportion (43%) believe women “make up” claims of abuse when going through child custody battles in court.

Yet research shows false allegations are rare. In fact, sexual assault, harassment and domestic violence are _under-reported to police.

Violence against women is common, with two out of every five Australian women experiencing some form of physical or sexual violence since the age of 15, and much of it from a male partner or ex-partner.

NCAS is a federally funded survey conducted by the independent research organisation ANROWS in 2017. It involved 17,500 phone interviews with a representative sample of Australians aged 16 years and older. It’s the third such national survey, allowing us to compare responses with those in 2009 and 2013.

Read more: Rape culture: why our community attitudes to sexual violence matter

It’s not all bad news. The results show a majority of Australians understand that physical assault, emotional abuse and controlling behaviour are forms of violence against women, and are common in our community.

Consistent investment in programs and campaigns has had a positive impact on reducing attitudes that support violence such as minimising and excusing. Out of a score of 100, the average score has reduced from 36 in 2013 to 33 in 2017.

ANROWS

Blaming the victim

The survey found one in three Australians believe women are partly responsible for relationship violence if they do not leave a violent partner (32%).

Another third (30%) believe if a woman sends a nude image to her partner, she is partly responsible if he shares it without her permission.

When questions are asked about the role of alcohol in relation to violence, 8% attribute responsibility and blame to women who were raped while alcohol- or drug-affected. Some 12% of Australians absolve men of blame if they are alcohol- or drug-affected at the time they perpetrate rape.

Two out of ten Australians (21%) believe because women express themselves sexually in public it’s not surprising men think they can touch them without permission.

Read more: 'Be careful posting images online' is just another form of modern-day victim-blaming

When victim-blaming attitudes are held by a substantial proportion of people, or influential people such as police, judges and health professionals, they can present barriers to victims seeking support or reporting the abuse.

Such attitudes also shift responsibility away from the perpetrators of violence, contributing to a culture in which perpetrator behaviour is at best not clearly condemned, or at worst, is actively condoned.

Disregard for consent

One in ten Australians believe if a woman is drunk and starts having sex with a man, but then falls asleep, it is understandable if he continues to have sex with her.

The survey also asked Australians to respond to a scenario where a woman takes her husband into the bedroom, starts kissing him, then pushes him away, not wanting to continue with sex. More than one in ten (15%) believed her husband would have been justified in having sex with her anyway.

Disregarding consent for touching women, sending nude photos or persisting with sex when a woman does not, or cannot give consent, are criminal offences in Australia.

These findings are significant because they indicate a concerning proportion of Australians are unclear about what constitutes consent, and the line between consensual sex and coercion.

Mistrusting women’s reports

As well as thinking women make up claims of abuse, one quarter (23%) of Australians believe women exaggerate the problem of male violence.

Almost a third (31%) believe that a lot of times women who say they were raped had “led the man on” and then had regrets.

Attitudes that suggest women lie to “get back at men” are particularly concerning in light of the high levels of violence against women, as well as under-reporting of these crimes. The fear of not being believed or taken seriously presents a barrier for women seeking help and support.

Read more: Australians still trivialise and excuse violence against women

Attitudes are a barometer of socially acceptable behaviour – and changing attitudes is often the first step toward changing behaviour. Attitudes can mean a perpetrator being held to account, instead of his behaviour being ignored. Or a bystander taking action, rather than turning a blind eye.

And now for the good news

One of the pillars of The National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children 2010 – 2022 has been to support attitude change as a first step to reducing prevalence of violence against women.

The NCAS survey shows there has been an increase in the understanding of violence against women, moving from an average score of 64 to 70, and improvement in support for gender equality moving from an average score of 64 to 66.

ANROWS

Exploring the detail of the survey questions shows an improvement on 27 of the 36 individual questions asked in both 2013 and 2017.

While there are specific areas of concern, Australians’ knowledge of, and attitudes towards, violence against women and gender equality are gradually improving. Most Australians do not endorse this violence.

Australian governments have invested heavily in campaigns and programs to reduce men’s violence against women over the past ten years and the current NCAS results show that there have been some rewards.

Changing attitudes and improving knowledge takes time, as well as continued policy and program efforts. It’s vital that governments, organisations and communities across Australia keep up the momentum if we are to ultimately see the end of attitudes that allow violence against women to occur. http://ncas.anrows.org.au

Africa: Children and HIV/Aids - 'We Need to Talk About Men's Power Over Girls',Africa: Children and HIV/Aids - 'We Need to Talk About Men's Power Over Girls',0.0,"interview

Johannesburg — 360,000 adolescents are projected to die of AIDS-related diseases between 2018 and 2030. This means 76 adolescent deaths every day – without additional investment in HIV prevention, testing and treatment programmes, UNICEF has said in a new report titled Children, HIV and AIDS: The World in 2030.

allAfrica's Sethi Ncube spoke with Dr Shaffiq Essajee, Deputy Chief of HIV programming at UNICEF Global. Essajee is also a member of the Paediatric Infectious Disease Faculty at New York University, where he has been caring for children who are HIV+ for the past 18 years. Dr Essajee was born in Kenya, and in 2001 he established one of the first free paediatric HIV clinics in the country, in the city of Mombasa.

Statistics show that HIV is prevalent among adolescents. Few schools in Africa have AIDS awareness programmes. What is the UNICEF doing to make sure awareness is thought of as early as possible?

I think that we have to recognise that what you understand and know about HIV, about sex and sexuality must be appropriate to your development and maturity, you can't take a six-year-old and say now let's talk about HIV prevention. What you can say to him or her is that your body is yours and you must not let somebody touch it without your permission, you mustn't let somebody give you ouchies if you don't want that. So there are age-appropriate things that you can do which you build upon gradually so that children can get that awareness and I think we think of it as something that's negative, a naughty thing. How are we going to talk about sex, we shouldn't be talking about those sorts of things - but the whole notion of comprehensive sexuality education says that's not a useful way of thinking. Yes, it has to be age-appropriate but it can happen at a very young age where you can start to introduce some ideas. Some concepts that you'll gradually layer information on. UNICEF doesn't do this on its own, we work very closely with some agencies like UNESCO which has produced a global way of thinking on sexuality education.

There's a lot of materials, curricular, that can actually be used by adapted by countries to their local context. UNICEF promotes that process so that we promote the idea that countries will take a look at this information and see how to incorporate it into their school curriculum. We should be teaching this in school, doing it in way that are age-appropriate, that are sensitive to the local culture and context, but doing it because it's important to protect young people, to empower them, to give them urgency and to protect them from violence and harm.

For some reason when it comes to sex education, we shy away from talking about sex because we imagine that it will encourage sexuality. The reality is the opposite actually. Most studies that have been done show that the more you educate children about these issues, about what's healthy sexuality and what maybe isn't the better informed kids get and the more likely that they are to delay sexual debut, the more likely they are to use protection when they become sexually active, the less likely they are to acquire HIV or other STIs or become pregnant as teenagers. So giving children awareness and information is critical to their long-term health and wellbeing.

What do you think needs to be done to tackle the stigma that comes with young people trying to access HIV health care, trying to access condoms and information?

That's a real tough one because stigma is in all of us, stigma exists in every health professional, I can not say that I'm indeed free from this. Whether its a fleeting thought that goes through my mind, negative ideas exist in all of us. All of us have biases, prejudices but as professionals, what we have to remember is that we got to have to leave all of that sh*t at home. You can not bring it into the work place, in the work place your job is to be the servant of humanity, if that's what you've signed up for then that what you need to do. I think UNICEF spends a lot of time doing stigma reduction amongst health professionals because that's the point where it hurts the most.

I think that stigma education and reduction actually is critically important first and foremost in the health service. We are not recognising that people need a little bit love, attention, nurturing even as much as they need these ARVs, that's a message that needs to come out much much strongly and ironically in the days before we had access to drugs and all we had was love and nurturing and a kind ear, we recognised that and we were better at it. We've over-medicalised HIV instead of recognising it as a human problem and we have to change that.



With so many conflicts around the world, in Africa particularly that often shifts HIV fighting efforts to the background in favour of humanitarian aid. How do we make sure testing is done knowing that early detection is key and how do you bring about awareness in such environments knowing that HIV/AIDS is not top of priorities in such situations?

First of all, it should be a priority because in fact we know that HIV spreads precisely in those situations, those situations expose women to violence. People take to violence in ways that they might not be exposed to, in a healthy society that's functioning. You disrupt that society, you put people on the move, you put them in displaced people's camps and you disturb the normal order of society and the conventions that protect people from getting HIV. So UNICEF has recognised this for a long time and recognised that even in the programming that we do in emergencies whether it's civil strife, war, refugees caused by drought or some other natural disaster, that putting people into camps and into environments where there are no more protection mechanisms, no longer function, increases the risk of HIV.

So we have a concerted programme to ensure that in such refugee settings HIV is not a forgotten element and again it's because what you do to protect people from HIV also protects them from harm in general. It's about protecting them from gender based violence, it's about protecting them from coercive sex, which brings untold harms which in addition to the possibility of HIV transmission and so we work in environmental situations to ensure that we are building that bridge between the humanitarian response and the broader development response in the country.



Today we are discussing such worrying statistics that concern children and adolescents. Why are we speaking in their absence? And this looks like a small event, should we not be making lot of noise about this huge issue?

First of all you are right, of course we have some young people at this World Aids event. We can and should always do more to make sure that young people are involved not just in our thinking but also in our programming. For me especially, it's because I'm a doctor, I'm familiar with the things that I know. I'm good at drugs and I'm good at medicine what i don't understand because I am a man in my fifties is really what it's like for a young person, a young woman living in the society, how can i really get an understanding of what her experience is like in such a way that I can provide advice on what should be done to change her experience and so without making sure young people are actually driving this thinking and driving the implementation of programmings surely we won't have the success that we want to achieve. UNICEF in general recognises the importance of that and in this forum we tried with Saidy Brown to be there but we didn't succeed in having the full compliment of youth that we wanted to and should have done.

This is one media launch in one country, we have similar things going on globally and of course in New York and also in other parts of the world so it is not an isolated event. We are not the only voice, UNAIDS has put out a number of media documents that talk about ""The Importance of Knowing Your Status"" that is the theme they are pushing for World Aids Day.

The U.S government has also put out strong messages on World Aids Day. There are many voices not just UNICEF's and there are many events like this happening in other parts of the world that will hopefully amplify the message.

Shouldn't more be done legally considering the huge numbers of new infections among adolescents? Who's having sexual intercourse with minors? Shouldn't there be an arm in UNICEF dealing with this problem?

I think child protection is a very important aspect of this, so UNICEF legislates very strongly against practices that put children in harm's way like for example child marriage which is often a way that in some societies young girls are pushed into very early sexual debuts but sometimes it isn't the adults in the community that are putting those children at risk, it is the fact that those children are living in such poverty themselves that suddenly they have something that is a commodity that someone is interested in and is interested in providing something, like money, some luxuries to that young person in exchange for their body. That's a very damaging way of thinking for young people. Adolescence is a time of transition and a time of change.

Sometimes things that happen in adolescence create life-long changes in that individual's life. So you can go through a phase where you need money and you think ""a sugar daddy is going to help me out with this, it doesn't need to be forever, this is just until I get a job, I know he has a wife somewhere and I know he's got a family but what do I care? It's going to be for a little while and then I'll make it on my own,"" but if you end up with HIV or end up getting pregnant, the effect of that is with you for life, even if the situation was a short-term situation that you needed to address in some way, the consequences can stay forever and I think that's the kind of message that we need to get out there, that young women and young girls don't put themselves in harm's way.

I think UNICEF needs to be more proactive about saying ""what about the guys?"". Why aren't we recognising that it is their desires, they may not know that they have HIV but they definitely know that they are not going to marry these young girls, they are not going to take them out of their poverty forever, they just want to use them for their amusement and entertainment and it's a power struggle, it's a power imbalance that is driving their behaviour. So we have to recognise that imbalance of power that exists.

I'm not saying it's a universal thing that we need to speak out against but what I'm saying is that men need to recognise their behaviours and how they can be coercive and abusive and at the very least they need to be accessing services so that they know if they are living with HIV so that they do not pass it on to these unsuspecting young women. That's the dialogue shift that needs to happen.

UNICEF of course is a child-focused agency so tend to talk about the adolescent, about the child, but what I think what we need to do is mobilise better, even though it's not our job to talk about men, older men in society, I think we need to mobilise in a different way to make sure that somebody is addressing that side of the equation as well.

What we are promoting globally now, is really a push to say look at the multiples things that need to happen. It's not just about pushing condoms out or making flavoured condoms available, that may be helpful but in itself it definitely won't be. Yes, put out your flavoured condoms but make it part of a package, make sure girls stay in school. Make sure education and information is available to young people. Make sure services aren't stigmatising so that if a young person goes into a facility and asks about their options for HIV prevention somebody isn't going to chase them away. There needs to be a shift in the way in which we are thinking and programming so that we take this multipronged approach to prevention.

How has the quality of ARVs improved over the years seeing that people who started taking ARVs over a decade ago suffered serious side effects from the pills that they were on?

The drugs have improved so much since we started fighting this epidemic, in the early years we used to use a drug called Stavudine D4T. And this medication was really important because it was one of the first drugs, it was cheap, which meant that it was something that countries could afford to use and it meant that countries could start talking about large scale treatment programmes for a treatment at the time in the Western world cost thousand and thousands of dollars a year. So it was critical to have some of those early drugs to change people's mindsets and say wow it's possible to treat the millions of people living with HIV, that live in poor countries as well as people that live in wealthy countries but at the same time those drugs were not necessarily the best options for long term treatment for people living with HIV. We didn't know this at the time but now we know that a drug like Stavudine causes some irreversible changes in the way in which the fat is distributed in the body. and toxicities unfortunately don't go away even if you stop taking the drug, you may not see a resolution of those kinds of changes that have taken place and so there are many people living with HIV who have been on treatment for a decade or more who were once started in 2005/6 with some of those early drugs who had an appearance that clearly showed that they had had some side effects from these therapies

Today the story is very different, now we have drugs that are extremely well tolerated, actually they are even cheaper than they used to be and they don't cause the sorts of disfiguring side effects that we used to see once upon a time. We are on the cusp of a new drug that is being released and being used in countries called Dolutegravir. This new drug is now approved by WHO and UNICEF supports its roll-out across the world and its extremely effective, its very well tolerated. Its a very small pill, so it can be easily combined with other treatments and its very affordable as well. So really the evolution in the science of developing new treatments is on-going, one day we hope to have treatments that can be given once a month or once every three months by injection for example so that you don't have to take a pill everyday or many times a day, you can get one injection every three months and that injection is good enough to keep your body suppressed with the HIV virus, suppressed inside it until its time for your next injection. Science is always evolving, fortunately in the world of HIV, we have very good relationships with the industry that is developing these new drugs and we see continuous change in the kinds of options available.",https://allafrica.com/stories/201811300567.html
Terrorism suspected in Eilat attack,Terrorism suspected in Eilat attack,0.0,"A violent attack in the southern Israeli port city of Eilat on Friday may have been an act of terrorism authorities say.

On Friday morning, a Jordanian man working in the port of Eilat as a dock worker attacked and injured two people.

According to the initial investigation, the assailant attacked his two victims with a hammer.

One of the victims suffered moderate injuries, while the second was lightly injured.

Police apprehended the assailant after the attack, and transferred him for questioning.

The MDA emergency first responder organization suggested that the incident appeared to have been a brawl between the workers, though a police spokesperson said that all possible motives were still being examined.

“At 8:31 p.m., a report was received at MDA’s 101 call center for the Negev region regarding two people who were injured in what appears to have been a brawl between workers on a ship in Eilat,” MDA said in a statement.

“MDA paramedics provided medical treatment and evacuated a 24-year-old man in moderate condition with contusions to his upper torso to Yoseftal Medical Center in Eilat, along with a second victim in light condition.”

Later, however, authorities suggested that the attack may have been nationalistically motivated, and was not a brawl as the MDA report had suggested.",http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/255514
Anti-Semitism never disappeared in Europe. It's alive and kicking,Anti-Semitism never disappeared in Europe. It's alive and kicking,0.0,"It's a 17-year-old boy, too frightened to wear a kippa (a religious skullcap) on the streets of Paris. It's an Israeli restaurant owner in Berlin who is told that he will end up in the gas chambers. It's a 24-year-old Austrian who knows nothing about the Holocaust. It's the armed guards outside synagogues and Jewish schools across much of Europe. It's the online chat rooms where people peddle conspiracy theories that Jewish ""globalists"" run the world.

It can be violent or subtle. Overt or insidious. Political or personal. It can come from the right or the left. It exists in countries that have large Jewish populations, like France, and it also flourishes in places with smaller Jewish communities, like Poland.

But one thing is clear. Anti-Semitism is alive and well across Europe. This was the glaring conclusion of a CNN investigation, based in part on a survey of more than 7,000 adults across seven European countries.

Despite Europe's troubling history with anti-Semitism, ugly, old stereotypes persist across the continent.

More than a quarter of Europeans surveyed believe Jews have too much influence in business and finance. One in five say they have too much influence in media and politics. In individual countries the numbers are often higher: 42% of Hungarians think Jews have too much influence in finance and business across the world.

While 44% of Europeans agree that anti-Semitism is a growing problem, a substantial minority is unsympathetic to the problem. Almost one in five (18%) agree that most anti-Semitism in their country is a response to the ""everyday behavior of Jewish people."" In Poland, 50% of people think that Jews use the Holocaust to advance their position; 19% of Hungarians admit to having an unfavorable impression of Jews altogether.

So why is anti-Semitism a growing phenomenon once again? Poland's Chief Rabbi, Brooklyn-born Michael Schudrich, is not sure the problem ever really went away.

""There will always be people who had anti-Semitic feelings and I don't know if the number has grown but this new situation today is they feel that it's more acceptable socially that they can express these opinions out loud...

""The feeling beforehand was, 'This is what I believe but don't tell anyone.' It was not perfect but at least there was a social taboo against anti-Semitism.""

CNN saw this at first hand in Germany, a country still haunted by the killing of some six million Jews at the hands of the Nazis during the Holocaust. Making anti-Semitic comments can be punishable under German law. And yet, at a rally of hundreds of right-wing extremists in the nation's capital, Berlin, we saw a man brazenly flash a Nazi salute, an act that could have landed him up to three years in jail. Another protester told us that a shadowy cabal of Jewish globalists runs the world.

The arrival of some 1.4 million refugees in Germany has energized the far right. The focus of their anger may be Muslim migrants, but they are reflexively anti-Semitic in their views. The Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, once considered a fringe element, now holds a solid 94 seats in parliament. Its message is clear: you don't have to be ashamed of being angry, you don't have to be ashamed of being white, you don't have to be ashamed of your past.

But the rise of the far right is only part of the picture. Based on dozens of interviews with members of various Jewish communities across Europe, it is clear that the threat is being felt from many sides.

In France, many Jews talk about the ""new anti-Semitism,"" coming from radical elements of France's growing Muslim population, which can be felt on the streets of Paris' working-class suburbs.

A happy life is a hidden life, we were told again and again by French Jews who refused to appear on camera. More and more Jewish families are moving out of these traditionally mixed neighborhoods -- a concern for the French government, which believes that integration, not separation, is key to improving the situation.

In Germany, the leader of Berlin's Kahal Adass Jisroel community organization, Doron Rubin, told me there is also concern about anti-Semitism coming from Muslim refugees, ""who have a different history and a different background, especially obviously coming from the Middle East, and who have, also because of Israel, a different attitude towards Jews.""

The nexus between negative attitudes toward Israel and anti-Semitism is a particularly thorny issue.

More than a quarter of French people have a somewhat or significantly unfavorable impression of Jews as a result of the Israeli-Palestinian issue. This impression is by no means limited to Muslims. Across the continent, many Jews we interviewed spoke of anti-Semitism coming from the left, which is often strongly critical of Israel.

Viewed as whole, it is a complex picture, made up of a confluence of different factors with no obvious, one-size-fits-all solution.

Felix Klein has called the results of the CNN poll into anti-Semitism ""appalling.""

Germany has appointed an anti-Semitsm czar, Felix Klein, who is working on creating a nationwide network for reporting anti-Semitsm and on improving education and integration in schools. Elsewhere, France is spending millions of dollars trying to combat anti-Semitic hate speech online.

Many agree that Holocaust education is an important step. Half of Europeans say that commemorating the Holocaust helps to combat anti-Semitism. And yet, frighteningly, the memory of the Holocaust is starting to fade.

More than a third of Europeans have either never heard of or know just a little about the Holocaust. That number is even higher when you look at the younger generation. In France, 20% of young adults have never even heard of the Holocaust.

When I asked Rabbi Schudrich how he feels about these numbers, he paused a moment before responding, ""It makes me feel I have more work to do.""

Europe should pay attention.",https://edition.cnn.com/2018/11/27/europe/anti-semitism-analysis-ward-intl/index.html
"Five dead, 32 injured in Hong Kong coach crash","Five dead, 32 injured in Hong Kong coach crash",0.0,"HONG KONG (AFP) - Five people were killed and 32 injured when a coach carrying Cathay Pacific staff to Hong Kong's airport collided with a taxi on Friday (Nov 30), police said, with passengers thrown from the coach's windows on impact.

The back half of the taxi was completely crushed and both sides of the bus were damaged with traces of blood on the outside following the crash on the island of Tsing Yi.

""We believe the taxi was broken down and stopped on the left lane of the road. Around 40 seconds later, a coach hit it from behind,"" police superintendent Yip Siu Ming said.

The coach then lost control, Yip added, hitting the right hand side crash barrier and then the left one and throwing three passengers out of the coach. The 62-year-old driver was also hurled from the vehicle and injured.

The taxi driver and two men and two women coach passengers were killed, according to police.

Debris including glass and personal belongings was strewn across the road, which remained closed early Friday.

Hong Kong carrier Cathay Pacific confirmed ""a shuttle bus carrying our employees was involved in a traffic accident this morning"".

""It is a tragic and very sad incident. We extend our deepest condolences to the families of those who have sadly passed away,"" the airline said.

Superintendent Yip said police would look into whether the coach driver - who had been working for 10 hours at the time of the accident - had been tired or affected by alcohol.

""From what we can see, it's obvious that the driver did not see the broken-down taxi on the road and hit it from behind,"" Yip said, adding that his working hours were from 7pm to 7am.

Tsing Yi is connected by a freeway to Hong Kong International Airport which is located on neighbouring Lantau island.

'CRUSHED TOGETHER'

Television footage showed the injured being treated by the side of the road before they were taken to four hospitals.

The South China Morning Post reported that several of the injured were in serious condition.

One coach passenger said the bus had been travelling fast before it crashed into the taxi which had its hazard lights on, according to SCMP.

""It seemed to me that the coach did not slow down. I fell onto the floor (when it crashed),"" the passenger said.

A passenger told local television channel TVB the scene on the bus was ""very chaotic, we were crushed together"".

Another said ""the bus hit once, then hit left and right, and hit the roadside to stop.""

Television footage showed the crash barrier on either side of the road was damaged.

The accident happened at 5am near the exit of a tunnel.

Hong Kong prides itself on having one of the world's best public transport systems but deadly bus accidents are not unknown.

A speeding double-decker overturned in northern Hong Kong in February, killing 19 people and leaving more than 60 injured. The bus driver was arrested for dangerous driving.

And in 2003 a double-decker bus collided with a truck and plummeted off a bridge, killing 21 people and injuring 20.",https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/five-dead-31-injured-in-hong-kong-coach-crash-police
